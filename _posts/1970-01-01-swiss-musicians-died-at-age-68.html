He was an active member of the Swiss cultural community and was widely respected for his contributions to the arts.</p><p>Despite his immense talent and influence, Ramuz remained a modest and private person throughout his life.

He was also a member of several art and architecture associations, including the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milan.</p><p>Pisoni's legacy continues to be celebrated in the Ticino region, where his contributions to the Baroque architecture movement are still appreciated today. Many of his buildings have been well-preserved and are popular tourist attractions.</p><p>Pisoni's influence on the Baroque movement was not limited to Switzerland, as he also received commissions in Northern Italy, particularly in the Lombardy region. One of his most notable projects outside of Switzerland is the Church of San Francesco in Gavirate, Italy, which he designed in the mid-18th century. Pisoni's designs were characterized by their grandeur, use of light and space, and ornate decoration. His intricate detailing of the façade and interior of the Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Lugano exemplifies these characteristics and is considered a masterpiece of Baroque architecture. </p><p>Pisoni was also a prolific writer with several publications on architecture and building techniques. His book "L'architetto pratico" (The Practical Architect), published in 1754, was a comprehensive guide for aspiring architects and builders, covering everything from materials and construction techniques to design principles and decorative elements. The book was widely read and influential in shaping the next generation of Baroque architects in Switzerland and beyond.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to architecture and the arts, Pisoni was awarded several honors, including the title of Cavaliere dell'Ordine dei Santi Maurizio e Lazzaro by the Duke of Savoy in 1766.
