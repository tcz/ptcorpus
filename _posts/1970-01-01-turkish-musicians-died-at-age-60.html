(June 23, 1901		Istanbul-January 24, 1962			Istanbul)


was
a Turkish
poet, writer and novelist.


					</p><p>He was also a literary historian, literary critic, and academic. Tanpınar is considered one of the most important modern Turkish writers, whose work is characterized by his use of traditional Turkish forms and his use of European literary techniques. He was deeply interested in the history and culture of Istanbul, and much of his writing is informed by his extensive knowledge of the city. Some of his most famous works include the novel "The Time Regulation Institute" and the poetry collection "A Green Pine Tree." Tanpınar was also a professor of Turkish literature and cultural history at Istanbul University. He was awarded the Grand National Prize for Literature, the highest literary prize in Turkey, in 1955.</p><p>Tanpınar started his education at Seminari-ı Ιbtidai, a primary school in Istanbul. He then attended the influential Galatasaray High School, where he was exposed to both Turkish and French literature, languages, and culture. After finishing high school, he studied literature and philosophy at Istanbul University, where he later served as a professor.</p><p>Tanpınar was heavily involved in cultural and artistic circles of his time, and he co-founded the literary magazine "Varlık" in 1933, which remains one of Turkey's most important literary journals. He was also an important member of the "Turkish Hearths" movement, which aimed to promote traditional Turkish culture and values.</p><p>In addition to his literary works, Tanpınar wrote extensively on Turkish cultural history, specifically on Ottoman literature, music, and art. His non-fiction works include "Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü Üzerine Makaleler" (Articles on The Time Regulation Institute), which examines the social, cultural, and political contexts of the novel.</p><p>Tanpınar's work has had a significant impact on Turkish literature and culture, and he is revered as one of Turkey's greatest writers. His novels and poetry continue to be celebrated and studied in Turkey and beyond.</p><p>Tanpınar's interest in cultural history is reflected in his writing style, which often juxtaposes the present with the past. His novel "The Time Regulation Institute" is a prime example of this, as it explores the tension between tradition and modernity. The novel is set in the early years of the Turkish Republic, and tells the story of an institute that aims to regulate time, a symbol of Western modernity, in Istanbul. Tanpınar weaves together elements of Turkish folklore, Ottoman history, and modernity to create a complex and layered narrative.</p><p>In addition to his literary and academic pursuits, Tanpınar was also a lover of music. He wrote extensively on Turkish classical music and was a skilled performer of the oud, a traditional stringed instrument. He believed that music was an integral part of Turkish culture and worked to preserve and promote it.</p><p>Tanpınar's legacy continues to be celebrated in Turkey today. In 2021, the Turkish government declared it the "Year of Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar" in honor of the 60th anniversary of his death. The year will feature events and exhibitions that highlight his life and work, as well as seminars and workshops for students and scholars interested in learning more about his contributions to Turkish literature and culture.</p><p></p><p>
