an American
actor and singer.


					</p><p>He began his career in vaudeville, performing in minstrel shows and touring with different theatrical troupes. In the 1930s, he started appearing in films and television shows, and eventually became a sought-after character actor, known for his rugged looks and gruff voice.</p><p>He appeared in over 135 films and 150 television shows, including "The Killing" (1956), "The Wild One" (1953), and "The Great Missouri Raid" (1951). Flippen was also a talented singer, and performed in several musicals and operas throughout his career.</p><p>Despite his success, Flippen was known for his humility and his willingness to work with younger and less experienced actors. He was married to actress Ruth Nelson for over 25 years, until her death in 1964.</p><p>Flippen died from a heart attack in 1971, at the age of 71. He is remembered today as a versatile actor and entertainer, who left a lasting impact on the entertainment industry.</p><p>Flippen was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, and grew up in the nearby town of Fayetteville. He dropped out of school at a young age and began working odd jobs, including as a carnival barker, before finding his way into show business. He eventually made his way to New York City, where he landed several small roles on Broadway before transitioning to film.</p><p>In addition to his acting career, Flippen was also a decorated war veteran, having served in World War I and World War II. He was awarded the Purple Heart for injuries he sustained in combat during World War II.</p><p>Flippen was known for his deep, distinctive voice, which made him a natural fit for voiceover work. He provided the voice for numerous film trailers and commercials throughout his career.</p><p>Despite his gruff exterior, Flippen was reportedly a warm and generous person off-screen. He was beloved by many of his co-stars and colleagues in Hollywood, and was known for his willingness to mentor and encourage young actors.</p><p>In his later years, Flippen struggled with health problems, including heart disease and diabetes. He continued to work up until his death, appearing in several television shows and films in the years leading up to his passing.</p><p>In addition to his acting career, Flippen was also a talented athlete. He played professional baseball for a brief period of time before focusing on his career in show business. He was also an avid golfer and often played with other celebrities in charity tournaments.</p><p>Flippen's range as an actor was impressive, and he was equally skilled at playing tough, no-nonsense characters as he was at delivering comedic performances. He was known for his work in film noir, westerns, and war films, but also appeared in musicals, comedies, and dramas.</p><p>Throughout his career, Flippen worked with some of the biggest stars in Hollywood, including Marlon Brando, John Wayne, and James Stewart. He was a favorite of director John Huston, who cast Flippen in several of his films, including "The Asphalt Jungle" (1950) and "Fat City" (1972).</p><p>Flippen's influence on the entertainment industry can still be felt today. Many actors and filmmakers cite him as a major influence on their work, and his performances continue to be studied and admired by film students and enthusiasts.</p><p>Despite his success as an actor, Flippen never forgot his humble beginnings and often gave back to his community. He was a regular volunteer at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital, a retirement home for members of the entertainment industry. He also supported numerous charities and was known for donating his time and resources to various causes.</p><p>Flippen's legacy as an actor and entertainer endures to this day. He was posthumously inducted into the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame in 1999, and in 2015, a documentary about his life and career, "Flippen: The Jay C. Flippen Story," was released. His fans continue to remember him as a talented and versatile performer, who brought his unique charm and talent to every role he played.</p><p></p><p>
