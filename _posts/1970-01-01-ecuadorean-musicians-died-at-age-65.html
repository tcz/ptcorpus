(January 27, 1727		Riobamba-June 29, 1792			Faenza)


was
an Ecuadorean
personality.


					</p><p>He was a Jesuit priest, historian, and writer. Velasco is best known for his work "Historia del Reino de Quito en la América Meridional" (History of the Kingdom of Quito in Southern America), which is considered one of the most comprehensive and detailed historical accounts of pre-Columbian Andean culture. </p><p>Velasco spent many years researching and studying the history and culture of the indigenous peoples of what is now Ecuador. He was particularly interested in the history of the Kingdom of Quito, which was a pre-Columbian civilization that existed in the northern Andes from the 10th century until the 16th century.</p><p>In addition to his historical work, Velasco was also a prolific writer of religious and philosophical texts. He was a respected scholar and teacher, and his work had a significant impact on the cultural and intellectual life of his time.</p><p>Despite his contributions to Ecuadorean culture, Velasco was eventually expelled from the country in 1767, along with all other Jesuit priests, as part of a wider suppression of the Jesuit order by the Spanish crown. Velasco spent the remaining years of his life in Italy, where he continued to write and advocate for the preservation of the indigenous cultures of South America.</p><p>One of Velasco's lesser-known accomplishments was his invention of a type of quinine powder that could be used to treat malaria. He developed this powder after witnessing the devastating effects of malaria on the indigenous population in Ecuador. This invention helped to save countless lives and was widely used throughout South America.</p><p>Velasco's work as a historian was groundbreaking for its time. He was one of the first scholars to document the culture and achievements of indigenous peoples in a positive and respectful way, and his work helped to challenge the prevailing Eurocentric view of history. However, his work has also been criticized for its inaccuracies and biases towards the Spanish colonizers.</p><p>Today, Velasco is celebrated as an important figure in Ecuadorian history and culture. Many institutions and organizations bear his name, and his work continues to be studied and debated by scholars and historians around the world.</p><p></p><p>
