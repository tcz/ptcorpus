In April 1946, Steinhoff was tried and convicted of war crimes by the Polish government and sentenced to death by hanging along with 10 other Stutthof personnel.

Her hanging was one of the first war crimes trials and executions to be carried out in the aftermath of World War II.</p><p>It is believed that Gerda Steinhoff was born in Gdańsk (then known as Danzig), Poland, to German parents.

At her trial, Steinhoff attempted to justify her actions by claiming that she was following orders and was unaware of the true nature of the atrocities being committed. However, her defense was not successful, and she was found guilty and sentenced to death.</p><p>Gerda Steinhoff's execution became a symbol of justice for the victims of the Holocaust and other war crimes. However, it is important to note that many other perpetrators of the Holocaust and other war crimes were never brought to justice. Today, Gerda Steinhoff's story serves as a reminder of the horrors that human beings are capable of inflicting upon each other and the importance of never forgetting the lessons of the past.</p><p></p><p>
