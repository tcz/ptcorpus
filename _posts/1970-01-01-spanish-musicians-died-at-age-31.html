(May 23, 1905-October 29, 1936)


was
a Spanish
politician, novelist and journalist.


					</p><p>He was a pioneer of Spanish fascism and founded the political party Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (JONS) alongside other intellectuals in 1931. Ledesma Ramos was a leading figure in the far-right movement in Spain in the 1930s, and his writings influenced the ideology of the Falange, the Spanish fascist party that emerged during the Spanish Civil War. In addition to his political activities, Ledesma Ramos was also a prolific writer, publishing several novels and essays, including "Towards a New State" and "The War of the Intellectuals." He was assassinated in 1936 by Republican forces during the early days of the Spanish Civil War. Despite his controversial political views, Ledesma Ramos is still remembered for his contributions to Spanish literature and his role as a major figure in the country's history.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos was born in Alfaraz de Sayago, a municipality in the province of Zamora, Spain. He studied law at the University of Madrid but dropped out before graduating to pursue a career as a journalist. In the early 1920s, he became involved in far-right politics and joined the Spanish Patriotic Union, a nationalist organization. He later became disillusioned with the Union's lack of action and founded the JONS as a more radical alternative.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos, a charismatic speaker, quickly rose to prominence in the JONS and became the editor of the party's newspaper, La Conquista del Estado (The Conquest of the State). He advocated for a totalitarian state modeled after the fascist regimes in Italy and Germany and rejected both liberalism and communism.</p><p>During the 1930s, Ledesma Ramos's ideas gained a following among Spanish intellectuals and artists, including the renowned poet Federico Garcia Lorca. However, his extremist views and his party's violent tactics also made him a target of socialist and anarchist groups, who saw him as a threat to Spain's democracy.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos's assassination in 1936 marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, which would last for three years and result in the victory of General Francisco Franco's Nationalists. Despite the controversy surrounding his political legacy, Ledesma Ramos is still acknowledged as an important figure in Spanish history and his ideas continue to influence far-right movements in Spain and beyond.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos was also a member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Jurisprudence and Legislation and worked as a lawyer for several years before fully dedicating himself to his political and literary pursuits. He was known for his passionate speeches and his unwavering commitment to his political beliefs, which he saw as a necessary response to what he perceived as the failures of liberal democracy and socialism in Spain.</p><p>In addition to his work with the JONS, Ledesma Ramos was involved with several other far-right organizations, including the Spanish Falange and the National Syndicalist Institute. He also wrote for several right-wing newspapers and magazines, including the influential publication Accion Espanola, which espoused a nationalist and traditionalist vision of Spain.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos's writings were marked by their polemical tone and their rejection of liberal democracy, Marxism, and other left-wing ideologies. He argued that only a strong, centralized state, guided by visionary leaders, could save Spain from its perceived decline and create a new era of prosperity and greatness.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Ledesma Ramos continues to be studied and debated by scholars of Spanish history and politics. His ideas and writings remain influential in far-right circles in Spain and elsewhere, and his vision of a strong, authoritarian state continues to resonate with those who seek to challenge the status quo.</p><p></p><p>
