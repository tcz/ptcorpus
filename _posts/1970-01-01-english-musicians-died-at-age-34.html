After communicating with other climbers on the mountain, it was determined that he was in dire need of help. However, due to the extreme conditions, no one was able to reach him in time and he succumbed to hypothermia.</p><p>His death sparked controversy and debate about the ethics of high-altitude mountaineering and the priorities of climbers faced with a fellow climber in distress.

His poetry, which was published in various literary magazines, was known for its fragmented style and use of mythological imagery.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Hulme was a talented artist and philosopher. He was particularly interested in the philosophy of Henri Bergson, which emphasized the importance of intuition and personal experience. Hulme's philosophical work, including his book "Speculations," influenced many other modernist thinkers.</p><p>Hulme's life was tragically cut short when he was killed in action during World War I at the young age of 34. Despite his brief career, he is remembered as a key figure in the development of modernism and his ideas continue to inspire artists and intellectuals around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(April 16, 1850		Canonbury-February 1, 1885			Paris)


was
an English
personality.


					</p><p>Thomas was a metallurgist and inventor who is known for his significant contributions to the steel industry. He discovered the basic process of removing phosphorus from iron ore, which was a major breakthrough in the production of high-quality steel. Thomas worked with his cousin Percy Gilchrist to develop the process, which was called the Thomas-Gilchrist process. The process involved the addition of a chemical called calcium carbide to the iron ore, which reacted with the phosphorus to form a solid slag that could be easily removed. </p><p>Thomas also patented an invention called the submerged arc furnace, which was used to produce calcium carbide. The furnace used an electric arc to heat the materials, resulting in a much more efficient and cost-effective production process. </p><p>Thomas was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and his contributions to the steel industry earned him numerous awards and accolades. Unfortunately, he died at a young age from tuberculosis, but his legacy lives on through his innovations and impact on the steel industry.</p><p>Sidney Gilchrist Thomas was born on April 16, 1850, in Canonbury, a district in Islington, London, UK. He was the son of a surgeon and had a strong interest in science from a young age. Thomas was educated at University College School in London, where he demonstrated a talent for chemistry and physics. Later, he went to study at the Royal School of Mines in London, where he gained a deeper understanding of metallurgy.</p><p>After completing his education, Thomas began his career as a metallurgist, working at various ironworks in the UK. In 1878, Thomas began working with his cousin, Percy Gilchrist, to develop a process for removing phosphorus from iron ore. At that time, the presence of phosphorus in iron ore made it unsuitable for steel production. Thomas and Gilchrist's process involved the addition of a chemical called calcium carbide to the iron ore, which reacted with the phosphorus to form a solid slag that could be easily removed.</p><p>The Thomas-Gilchrist process was a major breakthrough for the steel industry, and it significantly improved the quality of steel produced. The new process quickly became popular, and by the 1890s, it was widely used in the UK, Europe, and the United States. In addition to his work on the Thomas-Gilchrist process, Thomas also patented an invention called the submerged arc furnace. The furnace used an electric arc to heat the materials, resulting in a much more efficient and cost-effective production process.</p><p>Despite his achievements, Thomas's career was cut short by his premature death from tuberculosis in Paris on 1 February 1885, at the age of just thirty-four. He was buried in the PÃ¨re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Although his life was short, his contributions to the steel industry had a lasting impact on modern technology and manufacturing. His name is synonymous with the process that revolutionized steel production, and he is remembered as one of the greatest metallurgists of all time.</p><p></p><p>
