(April 5, 1965-April 5, 1992)

	
		a.k.a. Doctor Death or Doctor Killer

	
was
a Russian
personality.


					</p><p>Maxim Petrov was born on April 5, 1965, in Russia. He was a medical professional who worked as an anesthetist at a Moscow hospital. In 1992, he gained notoriety for his involvement in a series of murders that involved his patients. He would inject them with a lethal dose of potassium chloride, often while they were under anesthesia, and then attribute their deaths to natural causes. </p><p>Petrov's actions were discovered when an autopsy was conducted on one of his patients who had died suspiciously. The autopsy revealed high levels of potassium chloride in the patient's system. Petrov was arrested, and during his trial, he confessed to killing 14 patients. He was found guilty and sentenced to death, but his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment due to Russia's moratorium on the death penalty.</p><p>Petrov's case raised questions about the ethics and regulation of the medical profession in Russia. It also brought attention to the issue of serial killers who operate under the guise of medical professionals. Petrov died in prison in 2012 at the age of 47.</p><p>During his time in prison, Maxim Petrov sought to justify his actions by claiming that he was motivated by a desire to reduce the suffering of his terminally ill patients. He wrote several articles on the subject, arguing that euthanasia should be legalized in Russia to prevent doctors from being put in the same position that he was in. However, many people remain deeply disturbed by his actions, and he remains one of the most notorious serial killers in Russian history.</p><p>Despite his notoriety, very little is known about Maxim Petrov's life outside of his crimes. Some sources claim that he was married and had children, but there is little concrete evidence to support these claims. Many people have speculated about what might have motivated him to become a killer, but to this day, his true motivations remain a mystery.</p><p></p><p>
