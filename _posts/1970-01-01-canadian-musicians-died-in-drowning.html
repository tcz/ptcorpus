His work with Loverboy propelled him to international stardom, and he toured extensively with the band throughout the 1980s. Despite his success, Smith was known for his humble and down-to-earth personality.</p><p>In addition to his music career, Smith was also an avid outdoorsman and environmentalist.

His legacy continues to influence musicians around the world, and he is remembered as a kind and talented individual who left a lasting impact on the music industry.</p><p>Smith's influence on the music industry can be seen in the way he approached playing the bass. He was known for his unique style, which combined melodic playing with driving rhythms. His innovative approach to the bass was particularly notable in his work with Loverboy, where he added a distinctive edge to the band's sound. Smith's work with the band helped to define the arena rock sound of the 1980s, and his influence can still be heard in the music of many contemporary rock bands.</p><p>Despite his success with Loverboy and other bands, Smith remained dedicated to his craft and continued to work on new music throughout his life. He was known for his perfectionism in the studio and was constantly seeking to improve his playing and songwriting abilities.</p><p>Smith's tragic passing in 2000 was a shock to the music world and left many fans and fellow musicians reeling.
