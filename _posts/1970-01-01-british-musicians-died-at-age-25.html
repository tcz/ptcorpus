					</p><p>During World War I, Wilfred Owen served as a Lieutenant in the British Army and was known for his vivid and realistic war poetry. Some of his most notable works include "Anthem for Doomed Youth" and "Dulce et Decorum Est". Owen's poetry often shed light on the harsh realities of war and the psychological toll it takes on soldiers. After being diagnosed with shell shock, he was sent to recover in Edinburgh, where he met fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon, who had a significant influence on his writing. Despite his brief career, Wilfred Owen remains one of the most celebrated British poets of the 20th century.</p><p>Before the outbreak of World War I, Owen worked as a teacher and later as a private tutor. He was a devout Christian and briefly considered becoming a clergyman, but his experiences in the war led him to question his faith. In 1917, he was sent to France to fight on the Western Front, where he witnessed the horrors of trench warfare firsthand. He was wounded in battle and spent several months recovering before returning to the front lines. </p><p>Owen's poetry was heavily influenced by his experiences in the war and his conversations with fellow soldiers, many of whom he saw die in battle. He wrote about the physical and emotional pain of war, the senselessness of violence, and the impact of war on soldiers and civilians alike. His work was not well-known during his lifetime, but after his death, his poems were published and became widely read. Today, he is considered one of the greatest war poets in English literature.</p><p></p><p>
