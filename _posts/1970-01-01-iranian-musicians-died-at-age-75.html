politician.


					</p><p>He served as the Prime Minister of Iran from 1951 to 1952 and again from 1953 to 1954. Matin-Daftari was known for his advocacy of Iran's national sovereignty and for promoting policies that aimed to modernize the country's infrastructure, economy, and education system. He was also a vocal advocate for the empowerment of women and worked to promote their political and social rights in Iran. Following a military coup in 1953, Matin-Daftari was briefly imprisoned before being exiled to Europe for a number of years. He returned to Iran in 1963 and continued to engage in politics and social activism until his death in 1971.</p><p>During his tenure as Prime Minister, Ahmad Matin-Daftari implemented a series of progressive policies, including the establishment of the first national university in Iran, the University of Tehran. He also introduced land reforms and sought to redistribute land to small farmers and tenants, hoping to establish greater income equality in the country.</p><p>Matin-Daftari’s strong stance on sovereignty made him a leading figure in the nationalization of Iran's natural resources, particularly the country’s oil fields. He rejected a proposal made by foreign oil companies to have rights over Iranian oil reserves, instead advocating for the establishment of a government-owned oil industry.</p><p>Matin-Daftari was a prolific author and wrote extensively on topics ranging from history to politics to philosophy. He was a firm believer in the importance of education and often spoke of the need for Iranians to be well-educated and informed in order to achieve national progress and development.</p><p>He was a founding member of the Iran Novin (New Iran) Party and remained active in Iranian politics until his death. Ahmad Matin-Daftari's legacy as a progressive politician and an advocate for national sovereignty and education continues to be celebrated in Iran.</p><p>Additionally, Matin-Daftari held other key positions in the Iranian government prior to his tenure as Prime Minister. He served as the Minister of Agriculture and Natural Resources from 1946 to 1950 and was instrumental in initiating programs to modernize Iran's agriculture and to increase food production. Matin-Daftari also worked as the Minister of Interior from 1950 to 1951, where he played a role in shaping the country's electoral laws and the establishment of the SAVAK, Iran's intelligence agency.</p><p>In his later years, Matin-Daftari became increasingly critical of the Shah's regime and the lack of progress towards democracy in Iran. He was vocal in his opposition to the Shah's policies and the influence of the United States in Iranian politics. Matin-Daftari's criticisms would later inspire the anti-Shah and anti-American sentiment that fueled the Iranian Revolution in 1979.</p><p>Matin-Daftari was posthumously awarded the Medal of Freedom, which is the highest civilian award in Iran, in recognition of his contributions to Iranian politics and society. The University of Tehran has also named one of its main libraries after him as a tribute to his commitment to education and learning.</p><p></p><p>
