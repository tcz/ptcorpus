									</h1><p>Here are 13 famous musicians from Denmark died at 55:</p><h2>Christian Bohr</h2><p><strong>Christian Bohr</strong>
(February 14, 1855		Copenhagen-February 3, 1911			Copenhagen)


was
a Danish
scientist.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Niels Henrik David Bohr, Harald Bohr and Jennifer Bohr.

						</p><p>Christian Bohr was a physician and physiologist who is known for his important contributions to the fields of respiratory physiology and chemistry. He conducted extensive research on the structure and function of the lungs, and his work on the role of carbon dioxide in regulating breathing paved the way for further studies in the field of respiratory physiology.</p><p>Bohr was born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1855, and studied medicine at the University of Copenhagen. After earning his medical degree in 1880, he began working at the University of Copenhagen's Institute of Physiology, where he would spend his entire career.</p><p>Throughout his research, Bohr collaborated with his brother Harald, who was a mathematician and physicist. Together, they developed a mathematical model of the way that hemoglobin binds with oxygen in the blood, which is now known as the Bohr effect.</p><p>Bohr's son, Niels Henrik David Bohr, would go on to become a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics. Despite their different fields, the two Bohrs maintained a close relationship throughout their lives, and the elder Bohr is credited with sparking his son's interest in science.</p><p>Christian Bohr passed away in 1911, but his legacy lives on through his groundbreaking research and the many scientists who have been inspired by his work.</p><p>In addition to his work in respiratory physiology and chemistry, Christian Bohr also made significant contributions to the study of blood pressure regulation. He discovered the relationship between blood pressure and the amount of blood in the circulatory system, and his research laid the foundation for understanding the mechanisms that regulate blood pressure.Bohr was also an active member of the scientific community, serving as the president of the Danish Medical Association and as a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.Outside of his scientific work, Bohr was known for his dedication to his family and his love of music. He played the piano and the organ, and his musical talents were passed down to his son Harald, who became a well-known concert pianist.Christian Bohr's contributions to science have had a lasting impact, and his work continues to influence researchers in fields such as respiratory physiology, chemistry, and cardiovascular health.</p><p>Bohr's work on respiratory physiology and chemistry was not limited to his research in the laboratory. In fact, Bohr was known for his hands-on approach to science and frequently employed himself as a test subject in his own experiments. He would often intentionally induce hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) in himself by holding his breath or inhaling carbon monoxide, in order to better understand the physiological effects of these conditions on the body. This dedication to science and willingness to seek answers through personal experimentation is just one of the many reasons why Bohr is regarded as a pioneer in the field of respiratory physiology.</p><p>Moreover, Bohr's work on the relationship between blood pressure and circulatory volume was groundbreaking in its time and helped to establish the modern understanding of blood pressure regulation. Prior to Bohr's research, it was not understood how the body maintained a stable blood pressure despite changes in blood volume. Bohr's discovery of a feedback system involving the renal system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system laid the foundation for further studies into blood pressure regulation and the development of effective treatments for hypertension.</p><p>Despite his many contributions to science, Bohr is also remembered for his kind and compassionate nature. He often took the time to listen to his students and colleagues and was known for his willingness to help others whenever he could. This dedication to his work and compassion for his fellow humans is evident in both his scientific contributions and in the way he is remembered by those who knew him.</p><p></p><p>

He was a soldier and served in the Dutch army under William of Orange, who later became King William III of England. Prince George was known to be a loyal and supportive husband to Queen Anne, who suffered numerous miscarriages and stillbirths during their marriage. Despite being criticized for being overshadowed by his wife, Prince George was respected for his military achievements and his role in championing the arts and scientific pursuits. He established the Royal Observatory in Greenwich and founded the Royal Society of Arts. Prince George died at the age of 55 at Kensington Palace and was buried at Westminster Abbey alongside his wife, Queen Anne.</p><p>During his time as a soldier, Prince George of Denmark fought in many battles, including the Siege of Namur in 1695. Following this, he was appointed as a General in the British Army and held the position until his death. He was also appointed as Lord High Admiral of the British Navy and was responsible for modernizing the British fleet. </p><p>While Prince George was not directly involved in politics, he shared his wife's support for the Tories and was a vocal opponent of the Whigs. After Queen Anne's death, he was succeeded as Duke of Cumberland by his son-in-law, Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt. </p><p>In addition to his military and political accomplishments, Prince George was known for his love of music and patronage of the arts. He was a skilled player of the harpsichord and supported composers such as Giovanni Battista Draghi and George Frideric Handel. He also commissioned many works of art, including the famous Hampton Court Beauties portrait series by Sir Godfrey Kneller. </p><p>Overall, Prince George of Denmark played an important role in British history as a soldier, naval leader, and patron of the arts. His legacy is remembered today through institutions such as the Royal Observatory and the Royal Society of Arts, which he helped establish during his lifetime.</p><p>Additionally, Prince George of Denmark played a significant role in the Act of Settlement of 1701, which secured the Hanoverian succession to the British throne. The Act excluded any Roman Catholic heirs from succeeding to the throne and instead established that the crown would pass to Protestant descendants of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, who was a granddaughter of James I. This act was crucial in stabilizing the British monarchy and ensuring its Protestant identity. In recognition of his contributions, Prince George was posthumously created Earl of Kendal, Viscount Weymouth, and Duke of Kendal by Queen Anne. Today, he is remembered as a devoted husband, a capable military commander, and a patron of the arts and sciences who played an important role in shaping British history.</p><p></p><p>

(September 5, 1800-July 14, 1856			Frederiksberg)


was
a Danish
architect.


					
			
		His child
		is
		called
		Thorvald Bindesbøll.

						</p><p>Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll was born in Ledøje, Denmark and studied at the Copenhagen Art Academy. He was one of the leading figures of the Danish Golden Age, and his architectural style was a departure from the traditional neoclassical designs of his contemporaries. Bindesbøll's works were characterized by the use of natural forms and experimental materials, and his works were heavily influenced by the ideas of Romanticism.</p><p>Bindesbøll's most significant commission was the design of the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen, which is dedicated to the life and work of the neoclassical sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. The museum is considered one of the finest examples of Bindesbøll's work, and he also designed many other buildings in Denmark, including the Royal Porcelain Factory in Copenhagen.</p><p>In addition to his architectural work, Bindesbøll was also a noted ceramicist and designer, creating many innovative pieces that were exhibited at international exhibitions. He was also involved in the design of the Danish flag, which was adopted in 1854. Bindesbøll died in Frederiksberg in 1856, at the age of 55.</p><p>During his lifetime, Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll became a member of the prestigious Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and rose to prominence as one of the leading architects in Denmark. In addition to his architectural and design work, Bindesbøll was also an avid traveler, and his journeys to Germany and Italy greatly influenced his ideas and designs.An interesting fact about Bindesbøll is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder that caused him to progressively lose his hearing. Despite his hearing loss, Bindesbøll remained highly active and continued to produce innovative designs and works until his death. His legacy continues to influence Danish design and architecture, and his work is still highly regarded by architects and designers around the world.</p><p>Bindesbøll's influence on design extended beyond his lifetime, particularly in the field of ceramics. His experimentation with glazes and forms, as seen in his ceramic works, inspired the development of the Art Nouveau movement, and his influence can be seen in the works of famous Art Nouveau artists such as Alphonse Mucha and Émile Gallé.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to Danish design, Bindesbøll's impact on Danish culture was also significant. He was instrumental in reviving interest in the work of Bertel Thorvaldsen and played a key role in the establishment of the Thorvaldsen Museum. He also designed the monument to Hans Christian Andersen, one of Denmark's most famous writers, which can be seen in the poet's square in Copenhagen.</p><p>Today, Bindesbøll's legacy endures not only in his works but also in the many institutions established in his honor. The Michael Bindesbøll Society, a group dedicated to promoting interest and knowledge of his work, was founded in Denmark in 1915. His home in Frederiksberg, now known as the Bindesbøll House, is a museum dedicated to his life and works.</p><p></p><p>
