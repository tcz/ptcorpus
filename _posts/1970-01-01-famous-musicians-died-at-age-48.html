(November 22, 1729		Bedous-June 20, 1778			Arkansas River)

	
		otherwise known as Pierre Laclede

	
was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>Pierre Laclède was a merchant who established St. Louis, Missouri in 1764 with his stepson, Auguste Chouteau. Prior to this, he was successful in the fur trade and had established a trading post in Illinois. Laclède died on a journey to New Orleans along the Arkansas River in 1778. The city of Laclède, Missouri, and a statue of him in St. Louis commemorate his contributions to the founding of the city of St. Louis.</p><p>Pierre Laclède, born on November 22, 1729, in Bedous, France, began his career as a fur trader at an early age. He learned the business from his father, who was also a fur trader. Pierre's father had been appointed as the French Commandant of Fort Chartres in colonial Illinois, and it was there that Pierre established himself as a successful merchant.</p><p>In 1763, French Louisiana was transferred to Spanish control under the Treaty of Paris. This transfer created uncertainty for Laclède's fur trade business. He concluded that it was time to find a new location to set up a trading post. Pierre Laclède chose a spot near the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, where he could take advantage of the trade routes that used these waterways. He sent his stepson, Auguste Chouteau, and a small group of men to establish a settlement in 1764, which would later become the city of St. Louis, Missouri.</p><p>Laclède meticulously planned the layout of the new town with Chouteau, including the streets and blocks, much of which still exists today. The town soon became a thriving hub of trade and commerce, attracting fur traders, merchants, farmers, and immigrants.</p><p>Although his time in St. Louis was relatively brief, Laclède had laid the groundwork for a settlement that would become one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the United States.</p><p>Sadly, Pierre Laclède died on June 20, 1778, during a trip down the Arkansas River to New Orleans. A statue of Pierre Laclède stands in St. Louis, commemorating his contribution to the city's founding, and the city of Laclède, Missouri, is named after him.</p><p></p><p>

was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>She was born Helene Kafka, but later changed her name when she joined the order of Franciscan Sisters. She worked as a nurse in Austria, and during World War II, she spoke out against the Nazi regime and refused to remove crucifixes from the hospital where she worked. As a result, she was arrested, tortured, and eventually executed by beheading on March 30, 1943. In 1998, she was beatified by the Catholic Church, and is now known as Blessed Maria Restituta.</p><p>Blessed Maria Restituta was known for her strong faith and dedication to her work as a nurse. Before joining the convent, she worked as a surgical nurse at the Lainz Hospital in Vienna. Her colleagues and patients alike praised Restituta for her kindness and skillful care.</p><p>During the Nazi occupation of Austria, the regime began implementing policies that violated Restituta's deeply held religious beliefs. In response, she actively protested against the regime by distributing pamphlets and other materials critical of the Nazi party. She also refused to remove a crucifix from her hospital's chapel, despite strict orders from the Nazis.</p><p>Restituta's courageous defiance eventually caught the attention of the Gestapo, who quickly arrested her and subjected her to months of brutal interrogation and torture. Despite this, she refused to renounce her faith or betray her fellow nuns and colleagues.</p><p>Blessed Maria Restituta was posthumously awarded numerous honors for her bravery and devotion to God, including the title of "Righteous Among the Nations" by Yad Vashem in 1975. She remains a celebrated figure among the Catholic community and a symbol of resistance against oppressive regimes.</p><p></p><p>

He also conducted experiments on electromagnetic fields and developed a theory about the conversion of heat into electricity.</p><p>Davenport's contributions to the field of electromagnetism were not limited to inventions and scientific theories. He also played a crucial role in raising public awareness about the potential of electric power. In his lectures, he spoke passionately about the possibility of using electricity to power everything from machines to transportation.</p><p>Sadly, Davenport did not live to see his vision of a world powered by electricity become a reality. He passed away in 1851 at the age of 48.
