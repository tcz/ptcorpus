						</p><p>King was a central figure in the civil rights movement, advocating for nonviolent protests against racial segregation and discrimination. He led the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 and helped organize the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. In 1964, he became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize at the age of 35. King's advocacy for civil rights extended beyond race, as he also spoke out against poverty and the Vietnam War. His work paved the way for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Unfortunately, King was assassinated in 1968 at the age of 39, leaving a lasting impact on the civil rights movement and American society as a whole.</p><p>King was born into a Baptist family and became a pastor at the age of 25. He was heavily influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence and civil disobedience, which he applied to the civil rights movement in the United States. In addition to his activism, King was also a prolific writer, publishing five books and numerous articles and speeches during his lifetime. He earned his PhD in theology from Boston University in 1955. King's assassination in Memphis remains a subject of controversy and conspiracy theories to this day. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal, and his legacy is celebrated every year with a federal holiday on the third Monday of January.</p><p></p><p>
