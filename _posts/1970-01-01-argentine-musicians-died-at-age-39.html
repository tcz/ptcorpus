		He had
		five
		children,
		Aleida Guevara, Hilda Guevara, Ernesto Guevara, Camilo Guevara and Celia Guevara.

						</p><p>Che Guevara was one of the key figures in the Cuban Revolution which took place from 1953 to 1959. He played a vital role in toppling the right-wing government of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista and bringing Fidel Castro to power. Che was appointed as Minister of Industry in the newly formed Castro government and became an important figure in Cuba's political and economic affairs.</p><p>After a few years, Che left Cuba and spent time in other countries, including the Congo and Bolivia, where he tried to incite revolution. However, he was captured by Bolivian forces and executed, becoming a symbol of rebellion and revolution around the world.</p><p>Che was an avid writer and his most famous work, "The Motorcycle Diaries," documented his journey across South America on a motorcycle with his friend Alberto Granado. The book became a bestseller and was later turned into a movie.</p><p>Che's image, featuring his iconic beret and stylized as a black-and-white portrait, became a symbol of revolution and resistance against oppression. His image has been featured on countless posters, t-shirts, and other products and has become a cultural icon.</p><p>Che Guevara was born in Rosario, Argentina, and grew up in a middle-class family. He studied medicine at the University of Buenos Aires, but soon became disillusioned with the medical profession and turned to revolutionary politics. He traveled through Latin America, observing the poverty and oppression faced by its people, and became determined to fight for their rights.</p><p>In 1953, Che joined the 26th of July Movement, led by Fidel Castro, which aimed to overthrow Batista's regime in Cuba. He played a key role in the guerrilla warfare that finally toppled Batista in 1959. After the revolution, Che became an important figure in the Castro government, advocating socialist policies and helping to establish the Cuban economy.</p><p>Che was a staunch anti-imperialist, and he traveled extensively throughout the world to promote revolutionary causes. He worked to support anti-colonial movements in Africa and Asia and was a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause. He also helped to establish a socialist government in Bolivia, but his efforts were thwarted by the US-backed Bolivian military.</p><p>Che was captured by Bolivian forces in 1967 and executed without trial the next day. His death was a blow to the revolutionary movement, but his legacy and image continued to inspire left-wing activists and rebels around the world. Today, he is remembered not only as a revolutionary hero but also as a symbol of youthful idealism and political activism.</p><p>Che Guevara was not only a revolutionary leader but also a prolific writer. He authored several books, including "Guerrilla Warfare," "Man and Socialism in Cuba," and "Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War." His writings and speeches advocated for socialist and anti-imperialist ideals, and his strong beliefs resonated with many people around the world.</p><p>Despite his status as a cult figure, Guevara's legacy remains controversial. While many view him as a hero and a champion of social justice, others criticize his tactics and his role in the execution of political opponents in Cuba. Nevertheless, his impact on Latin American history and activism is undeniable, and his image continues to inspire those who seek to challenge oppressive systems of power.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by execution by shooting.
