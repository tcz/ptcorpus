		also known as Walter, William Henry

	
was
a British
naturalist and explorer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his expeditions to the Amazon rainforest in the mid-19th century, during which he conducted extensive research into the region's flora and fauna. Bates' most significant contribution to science was his discovery of Batesian mimicry, a form of mimicry in which a harmless species evolves to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species in order to deter predators. His findings on this subject were influential in the development of evolutionary theory, and he was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in recognition of his work. In addition to his scientific achievements, Bates was also a noted author and published several books on his travels and research, including "The Naturalist on the River Amazons" and "Central America, West Indies, and South America."</p><p>Bates' interest in natural history began at a young age, and he spent much of his free time collecting and studying insects. He worked as a clerk for several years before receiving a grant from the Royal Geographical Society to accompany the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace on an expedition to the Amazon in 1848. Bates and Wallace planned to spend two years collecting specimens and studying the region's natural history, but Bates ended up staying for an additional ten years to continue his research.</p><p>During his time in the Amazon, Bates collected over 14,000 species of insects, many of which were new to science. He also observed and documented the behavior of a wide range of animals, including monkeys, bats, and snakes. Bates' observations of mimicry in butterflies, in which non-toxic species resemble toxic or distasteful ones, led to his discovery of Batesian mimicry.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Bates also helped to establish the Amazon Naturalists' Society, and he worked to promote the conservation of the region's natural resources. After returning to England, he served as the secretary of the Royal Geographical Society from 1879 until his death in 1892. Bates' contributions to science and his pioneering work in the Amazon continue to be celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>
