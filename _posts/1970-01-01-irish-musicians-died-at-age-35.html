(June 7, 1892		Stradbally-July 10, 1927			Dublin)


was
an Irish
politician.


					</p><p>Kevin O'Higgins was a prominent figure in the Irish War of Independence and served as Minister for Justice in the Irish Free State government from 1922 until his untimely death in 1927. He was a key architect of the Irish legal system and played a significant role in the establishment of An Garda Síochána, Ireland's national police force. O'Higgins was a staunch defender of the Irish Free State and opposed any efforts to reunite Ireland under British rule. His assassination by Republicans was a major blow to the fledgling Irish government and sent shockwaves throughout the country. Despite his controversial legacy, O'Higgins is remembered as one of the most influential figures in modern Irish history.</p><p>Before becoming a politician, Kevin O'Higgins was a successful barrister who quickly gained a reputation as a skilled legal mind. He was also a prolific writer and authored several books on Irish history and law. O'Higgins was deeply involved in the Irish Nationalist movement from a young age and was one of the founders of the Sinn Féin party. However, his political beliefs shifted after the 1916 Easter Rising, which he saw as a misguided and failed rebellion. </p><p>During the Irish War of Independence, O'Higgins was a close confidant of Michael Collins and played a crucial role in the intelligence operations that helped the Irish Republican Army (IRA) gain the upper hand against the British forces. After the conflict, he was appointed Minister for Justice and immediately set about reforming the Irish legal system. He introduced a number of new laws that modernized the country's legal code and created a more efficient and effective justice system. </p><p>O'Higgins was also responsible for establishing An Garda Síochána, which he envisioned as a civilian police force that would be accountable to the government and free from the corruption that had plagued earlier police forces in Ireland. He was a staunch opponent of vigilante justice and sought to establish the rule of law throughout the country. </p><p>O'Higgins' assassination is widely believed to have been carried out by Republicans who were unhappy with his hardline stance on law and order and his opposition to reunification. His death was a major blow to the Irish government and plunged the country into a period of political turmoil. Despite his controversial legacy, O'Higgins is remembered as a key figure in the establishment of the Irish Free State and a champion of the rule of law.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in assassination.
