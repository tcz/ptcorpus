									</h1><p>Here are 5 famous musicians from Austria died at 28:</p><h2>Egon Schiele</h2><p><strong>Egon Schiele</strong>
(June 12, 1890		Tulln an der Donau-October 31, 1918			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
artist, painter and visual artist.


					</p><p>Schiele was known for his provocative and often controversial subject matter, which included sexually explicit nudes and self-portraits. He was a key figure in the Expressionist movement, and his use of distorted forms and bold, gestural lines influenced many artists who would follow in his footsteps. Schiele's career was cut tragically short by his untimely death at the age of 28, but his work has had a lasting impact on the art world and continues to inspire and influence artists today. Despite his short life, Schiele left behind a significant body of work, including hundreds of drawings and paintings that are admired for their raw energy and intense emotional power.</p><p>Schiele's artistic career began at a young age, as he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna at just 16 years old. However, he soon became dissatisfied with the traditionally conservative teachings at the Academy and began to explore more experimental styles and subject matter on his own.</p><p>In 1909, Schiele met fellow artist Gustav Klimt, who became a mentor and important influence on his work. Klimt introduced Schiele to the world of Vienna's avant-garde artists and helped him gain recognition in the art world.</p><p>Despite controversy surrounding his explicit content, Schiele gained a following of admirers and collectors, including the influential art dealer Arthur Roessler, who helped to promote his work.</p><p>Schiele's personal life was also marked by scandal. He entered into a tumultuous relationship with a young woman named Wally Neuzil, whom he often painted and who became a frequent subject of his work. Schiele was also arrested and briefly imprisoned for his depictions of nude minors, which were considered pornographic by Austrian authorities.</p><p>Throughout his brief but prolific career, Schiele pushed artistic boundaries and created a body of work that remains influential and relevant today. His legacy continues to inspire artists and art lovers around the world.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his life and work, Egon Schiele's art has been exhibited in major museums and galleries around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Leopold Museum in Vienna. In recent years, his artwork has sold for record-breaking prices at auctions, cementing his place as one of the most important artists of the 20th century. Schiele's influence can be seen in the work of many contemporary artists, who continue to experiment with provocative subject matter and unconventional techniques. His tragic death at a young age has only added to his mystique and the enduring appeal of his art.</p><p>In addition to his paintings and drawings, Egon Schiele also experimented with other forms of art, including sculpture and photography. He was a prolific writer and kept numerous journals and diaries throughout his life, which offered insight into his creative process and personal struggles. Schiele was deeply influenced by the art of his time, including the work of Vincent van Gogh and Edvard Munch, and he also drew inspiration from the work of older masters such as Albrecht Dürer and Francisco Goya. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Schiele's work and the art of the Vienna Secession, to which he belonged, as scholars and critics have reevaluated the significance of these artists in the broader history of modern art.</p><p></p><p>

(September 27, 1735		Vienna-July 30, 1764			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
writer.


					</p><p>He was a member of the Viennese literary circle "Die Sonntagskränzchen" ("The Sunday Wreaths") and was known for his humorous and satirical writings. Hafner's most famous work is "The Female Barber" ("Die Frauenbarbierin"), a comical play that pokes fun at the medical profession and gender roles in 18th century Austria. Tragically, Hafner died at the young age of 28 from tuberculosis, cutting short what could have been a promising literary career. Despite his brief time as a writer, Hafner's works continue to be studied and appreciated for their wit and insight into Austrian culture during the Enlightenment.</p><p>Hafner was born into a family of artists and musicians, and showed a talent for writing at a young age. He received his education at the Jesuit Gymnasium in Vienna, and later studied law at the University of Vienna, but eventually dropped out to pursue writing full-time. Hafner's writing style was heavily influenced by the French Enlightenment and he was inspired by the works of Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. </p><p>Apart from "The Female Barber", Hafner wrote several other plays, novels, and satirical essays. His works were characterized by their sharp wit and social commentary, and often targeted the hypocrisy and corruption of the Austrian aristocracy. In addition to his literary pursuits, Hafner was also involved in the Freemasonry movement, which was gaining popularity in Austria at the time.</p><p>Hafner's untimely death was mourned by his contemporaries, who recognized his talent and potential as a writer. His works continued to be widely read and staged after his death, and he is considered to be one of the most important figures of the Viennese Enlightenment. Despite his short life, Hafner left a lasting legacy in Austrian literature and his works continue to inspire and entertain readers today.</p><p>Hafner's work was not without controversy, and he frequently found himself at odds with the conservative establishment of his time. For example, "The Female Barber" caused outrage among the medical profession, who felt that it mocked their expertise and demeaned their profession. Hafner also faced criticism from those who felt his writing was too radical or impious. Nevertheless, his works remained popular with the general public and he garnered a dedicated following.</p><p>In addition to his literary accomplishments, Hafner was also an accomplished musician and composer. He frequently collaborated with his friends in the Sonntagskränzchen on musical projects, and wrote a number of songs, operas, and instrumental pieces. Sadly, his musical talents were also cut short by his untimely death.</p><p>Despite the brevity of his life and career, Philipp Hafner remains a beloved figure in Austrian literature and culture. His plays are still performed today, and his humorous and incisive critiques of society resonate with modern audiences. For those interested in the cultural history of Vienna and the Enlightenment period, Hafner's works are a must-read.</p><p>Hafner's legacy also extends beyond his literary and musical achievements. He was an advocate for social justice and equality, and used his writing to criticize the treatment of the lower classes in Austria's feudal society. He believed in the power of education and enlightenment to effect positive change in society, and was a vocal supporter of the principles of the Enlightenment period. Hafner's beliefs and values continue to inspire those who seek to promote social justice and equality in modern-day Austria.Hafner's influence on Austrian literature and culture is evident in the numerous honors and tributes he has received. In 1896, a street in Vienna's 10th district was named after him, and in 1935, a commemorative plaque was installed on his former residence in the city. His works have been translated into multiple languages, and continue to be studied and admired by literary scholars around the world. Philipp Hafner may have lived a short life, but his impact on Austrian culture and society is immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>

(April 18, 1942		Mainz-September 5, 1970			Autodromo Nazionale Monza)


was
an Austrian
race car driver.


					</p><p>Rindt is considered one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time, having won the 1970 Formula One World Championship posthumously, after being fatally injured during practice for the Italian Grand Prix.

He began racing in karting at a young age and quickly moved into Formula Junior and then Formula Two. In 1964, he made his Formula One debut with the Cooper team and scored his first podium that same year in the Austrian Grand Prix. </p><p>In 1965, Rindt joined Brabham and earned his first career victory in the non-championship 1965 Mediterranean Grand Prix. He switched to Lotus in 1969 and had his best season, winning four Grand Prix races and finishing second in the championship. The following year, Rindt was leading the championship when he died in a crash during practice at Monza.

Jochen Rindt did not die as a result of a traffic collision, but rather as a result of the high-speed crash during practice for the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza in 1970. I have provided the correct information in my previous message.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of traffic collision.
