		also known as Vadim Alekseyevich Kozin

singer.


						</p><p>His father was an opera singer, and Kozin followed in his footsteps by studying at the Leningrad Conservatory. He began his career performing in restaurants and nightclubs, and later became well-known for his contributions to Soviet cinema, recording numerous songs for popular films. Kozin's romantic style and soaring tenor voice earned him a large following, with fans sometimes fainting during his performances. However, Kozin's career was cut short in 1949 when he was arrested on charges of homosexuality, which was then illegal in the Soviet Union. He served six years in prison and then lived in relative obscurity in Magadan until his death in 1994. Despite the controversy surrounding his personal life, Kozin is still regarded as one of the greatest Russian singers of the 20th century.</p><p>Some of Kozin's most popular songs include "The Nightingale," "The Blue Kerchief," and "It Happened in the Donbass." He is also remembered for his contributions to the war effort during World War II, as he entertained troops on the front lines. Kozin was a prolific songwriter himself, having composed over 300 songs during his career. In addition to his musical talents, Kozin was also a talented artist and created many paintings and sculptures throughout his life. Despite facing persecution for his sexuality, Kozin remained unapologetic and defiant. He once said, "I am who I am. I sing as I sing. I am not a hypocrite and I do not hide the fact that I love men." To this day, Kozin's music continues to be celebrated and listened to by people all around the world.</p><p>Kozin's legacy has been commemorated through various means in contemporary Russia, including a museum dedicated to his life and works. His music has been featured in numerous films, television shows, and theatrical performances, and has been covered by many artists in different languages. Kozin's contributions to the Soviet cultural scene have been recognized posthumously, with several exhibitions and concerts held in his honor. In 2016, he was awarded a Star on the St. Petersburg Music Walk of Fame, alongside other notable Russian musicians such as Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich. Despite the tragic circumstances of his life, Kozin remains an important figure in Russian music and culture, remembered for his unique artistic vision and unwavering spirit.</p><p></p><p>
