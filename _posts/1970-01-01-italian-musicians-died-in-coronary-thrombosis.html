						Nino Rota was born in Milan in 1911 into a musical family. His father was a renowned conductor and composer, and his mother was a singer. With their support and encouragement, Rota began studying music at a young age, and went on to study at the Milan Conservatory. He began composing music for films in the late 1930s, and quickly gained a reputation as one of the best film score composers in Italy. His collaborations with director Federico Fellini were particularly notable, resulting in some of the most iconic film scores of all time, including those for La Strada, 8 1/2, and Amarcord. Outside of his film work, Rota was also a respected composer of opera and chamber music. He taught for many years at the Liceo Musicale in Bari, and later at the Academy of Santa Cecilia in Rome. Rota was a prolific artist, creating hundreds of works over the course of his career, and his music remains beloved by fans and musicians alike.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=143160" title="Wikipedia article about Nino Rota">Nino Rota on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/italian-actresses-died-at-age-53.html' title='Italian actresses died at age 53'><strong>Italian actresses died at age 53</strong> List of the top 2 Italian actresses who died when they were 53</a></li><li><a href='/spanish-actresses-died-in-cardiac-arrest.html' title='Spanish actresses died in Cardiac arrest'><strong>Spanish actresses died in Cardiac arrest</strong> List of the top 1 Spanish actresses who died in Cardiac arrest</a></li><li><a href='/irish-actors-died-at-age-33.html' title='Irish actors died at age 33'><strong>Irish actors died at age 33</strong> List of the top 1 Irish actors who died when they were 33</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-asthma.html' title='Famous actors died in Asthma'><strong>Famous actors died in Asthma</strong> List of the top 13 Famous actors who died in Asthma</a></li><li><a href='/bangladeshi-musicians-died-before-turning-30.html' title='Bangladeshi musicians died before turning 30'><strong>Bangladeshi musicians died before turning 30</strong> List of the top 24 Bangladeshi music stars who died before 30</a></li><li><a href='/bangladeshi-musicians-died-at-age-39.html' title='Bangladeshi musicians died at age 39'><strong>Bangladeshi musicians died at age 39</strong> List of the top 6 Bangladeshi music stars who died when they were 39</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
