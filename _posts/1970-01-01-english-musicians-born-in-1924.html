was
an English
entrepreneur and homemaking.


					
			
		Her children
		are
		
		Pete Best, Rory Best and Roag Best.

							</p><p>Mona Best was the owner of the famous Liverpool jazz club, The Casbah Coffee Club, which was the venue where the Beatles made their debut performance. Mona's son, Pete, was the original drummer for the Beatles before he was replaced by Ringo Starr. The Casbah Coffee Club was known for its unique decor that was designed by Mona and her family, including a stage made out of old doors and a mural painted by a then-unknown Stuart Sutcliffe, who later became the Beatles' bassist.</p><p>Aside from her entrepreneurship, Mona was also a mother to four children and was known for her nurturing personality. She helped support her son Pete in his music career and was a big influence on the early success of the Beatles. Mona passed away in 1988 at the age of 64, but her legacy still lives on in the music scene of Liverpool.</p><p>In addition to her success as a businesswoman, Mona Best was also known for her philanthropy. She founded The Mersey Beat, a weekly music newspaper that supported local musicians and artists. Mona's support for the local community didn't stop there, as she was also a frequent donor to various charities such as the Cavern Mecca Appeal, which aimed to raise funds for a new community center in Liverpool.</p><p>Mona's entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to supporting the arts is an enduring legacy. Her work in creating and maintaining The Casbah Coffee Club and The Mersey Beat helped to cultivate the music scene in Liverpool and gave many young musicians the opportunity to showcase their talents. Today, both her contributions to the music scene and her nurturing personality are fondly remembered by musicians and fans alike in Liverpool and around the world.</p><p>Mona Best was born in Delhi, India, in 1924 to British parents, and grew up in Liverpool. She had a fascinating life before establishing The Casbah Coffee Club. During World War II, Mona joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force and worked as a plotter, helping with the tracking of incoming aircraft. She also supported her husband in his job as a civil servant, while raising her four children.</p><p>Mona's entrepreneurial skills were evident from a young age, as she started several successful businesses before The Casbah Coffee Club. After her divorce, she opened a hotel in Liverpool and later a successful club called The Jacaranda. She went on to establish the Casbah in 1959 in the basement of her family's house, where her son Pete and his bandmates would rehearse.</p><p>Mona's influence on the development of the Beatles was significant. She supported her son's music by arranging gigs and promoting his band the Black Jacks, and even helped design the drum kit that Pete used in his early performances. As the owner of the Casbah, she provided the Beatles with a unique venue to hone their skills in front of a live audience.</p><p>Despite her success in the music industry, Mona remained down to earth and was known for her kindness and generosity. She supported local charities and causes throughout her life, including the Liverpool Musicians' Benevolent Fund, which helped struggling musicians to pay their bills.</p><p>Mona Best's contributions to Liverpool's music scene have been widely acknowledged. The Casbah Coffee Club remains a popular attraction for tourists and music fans alike, and her name is synonymous with the early days of the Beatles. In recognition of her achievements, Mona was posthumously awarded the prestigious Freedom of the City of Liverpool in 2003.</p><p>Mona Best will always be remembered as a trailblazer in the music industry, particularly for her contribution to the Beatles' success. Her dedication to nurturing young talent and providing a platform for local musicians helped to establish Liverpool as a hub of musical creativity. She was known for her warm personality, her resilience, and her unwavering support for her children and for the local community. Mona Best's legacy as an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and mother continues to inspire generations of musicians and businesswomen.</p><p></p><p>
