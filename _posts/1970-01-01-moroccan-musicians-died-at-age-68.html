					</p><p>Choukri is primarily known for his autobiographical novel "For Bread Alone" which provides a harrowing account of his experiences growing up in poverty in Morocco, and coming of age in Tangier. The novel, which was published in 1973, was initially banned in Morocco due to its explicit content. Choukri's work often explored themes of poverty, illiteracy, and the struggles of marginalized communities in Morocco. In addition to "For Bread Alone," he wrote several other novels and collections of stories, including "Streetwise," "Jean Genet in Tangier," and "The Time That Remains." Choukri's work has been translated into many languages, and has been influential in shaping perceptions of Moroccan literature and culture. Despite being banned for much of his life, in the years before his death, he was celebrated as a major literary figure in Morocco and internationally.</p><p></p><p>
