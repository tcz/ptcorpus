writer, journalist and poet.


					</p><p>Olavo Bilac is considered one of the greatest poets in Brazilian literature. He initially studied law but abandoned it to focus on writing.

He was a strong supporter of the Republican movement and advocated for the separation of church and state in Brazil. Bilac was also involved in the founding of the Brazilian Aviation Association and was a passionate advocate for the development of aviation technology.

writer, playwright and journalist.


					</p><p>Azevedo played a key role in the development of Brazilian theatre, with many of his plays being performed to great acclaim in the late 19th century. He is known for his wit and satirical edge, which he brought to bear on a range of social and cultural issues of the time. In addition to his theatre work, Azevedo was also a prolific journalist and author of novels, essays, and other literary works. He is considered one of the most important literary figures of Brazil's Belle Époque period. Today, Azevedo is remembered as a pioneer of Brazilian theatre and a leading voice in the country's cultural and intellectual history.</p><p>Azevedo was the son of Portuguese parents, and he spent his early years in São Luís, in northern Brazil. He moved to Rio de Janeiro in his early 20s and began working as a journalist, writing for the country's leading newspapers and magazines. He soon became known for his sharp wit and insightful commentary on Brazilian society and politics.</p><p>In the late 1870s, Azevedo turned his attention to the theatre, and began writing plays that tackled issues such as corruption, sexism, and racism. His plays were hugely popular, drawing large audiences to the city's theatres and earning him critical acclaim. Azevedo's work was also instrumental in the development of a distinctly Brazilian style of theatre, which drew on local traditions and culture.</p><p>Azevedo's most famous play, "O Mambembe" (The Itinerant), was first performed in 1882 and is still performed in Brazil today. The play tells the story of a troupe of travelling actors who are trying to make a living in a world that doesn't value their art. It is a poignant commentary on the struggles of artists in Brazil at that time.</p><p>Despite his success, Azevedo never lost his commitment to social justice and equality. He remained a vocal advocate for women's rights, and was one of the first Brazilian writers to deal with the issue of domestic violence in his work. He also wrote extensively about the lives of the urban poor, using his platform as a journalist to raise awareness of their struggles.</p><p>Azevedo's legacy is still felt in Brazil today, and his work continues to be studied and performed by students, scholars, and theatre companies around the country. He is remembered as a pioneering figure in Brazilian literature and theatre, and as a champion of social justice and equality.</p><p></p><p>
