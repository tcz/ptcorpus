						</p><p>Rojas Pinilla served as the 19th President of Colombia from 1953 to 1957, after seizing power in a military coup. He was known for his authoritarian regime, which included the suspension of political parties and the establishment of a national reconciliation commission. Despite some economic improvements during his tenure, his administration was marred by accusations of human rights abuses and corruption. Rojas Pinilla was overthrown in another military coup in 1957, after which he lived in exile for several years before returning to Colombia in the 1970s. He died in Melgar in 1975 at the age of 74.</p><p>Rojas Pinilla was born in Tunja, Colombia in 1900. He began his military career at age 17, serving in the Colombian Army during the Thousand Days' War. He later studied engineering in the United States before returning to Colombia to continue his military career. He rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a general and serving as commander of the Colombian Army.</p><p>In 1953, Rojas Pinilla led a military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of President Laureano Gómez. Rojas Pinilla declared himself president and established a military dictatorship. He justified his actions by citing corruption and political instability in Colombia at the time. During his administration, Rojas Pinilla implemented policies aimed at modernizing Colombia's infrastructure and improving the economy. He also granted suffrage to women and Afro-Colombians, and promoted land reform.</p><p>However, Rojas Pinilla's regime was also marked by widespread human rights abuses, including disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings. His government censored the press and restricted political opposition. In response, guerrilla movements emerged in Colombia, and Rojas Pinilla's military launched a campaign to suppress them.</p><p>Rojas Pinilla was eventually ousted in 1957 in a military coup led by his former ally, General Gabriel París Gordillo. Rojas Pinilla went into exile in Peru before eventually settling in Spain. He was able to return to Colombia in the 1970s after a general amnesty was declared for political exiles. He died in the town of Melgar in 1975.</p><p></p><p>
