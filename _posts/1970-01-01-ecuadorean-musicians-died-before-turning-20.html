(April 5, 2015		Quito-April 5, 2015)


was
an Ecuadorean
personality.


					</p><p>Despite his short-lived existence of just one day, Ignacio Lasso is remembered for being the son of Ecuadorean actress and TV presenter, Erika Vélez, and her ex-husband, Pedro Lasso. Ignacio's story made headlines in the country as his birth and death were a tragic event for his family. Although he lived for just one day, Ignacio's legacy inspired his mother to become an ambassador for children's rights, spreading awareness about perinatal asphyxia and giving support to those who have faced similar experiences. Today, Ignacio is a symbol of hope and strength for many families who have experienced loss, and his memory lives on through the awareness his mother continues to bring to the issue.</p><p>Erika Vélez and Pedro Lasso were excited to welcome their first child into the world, but shortly after Ignacio's birth, he was diagnosed with perinatal asphyxia, a condition that occurs when a baby's brain doesn't receive enough oxygen and blood during birth. Despite the best efforts of the medical team, Ignacio passed away just one day later. This heartbreaking experience led Erika to become an advocate for children's rights and maternal health. She often speaks publicly about perinatal asphyxia and encourages parents to seek proper medical care to prevent similar tragedies from happening to other families. In addition, she started a support group for families who have lost children to perinatal asphyxia, offering them a place to share their grief and heal together. Despite the shortness of his life, Ignacio's impact has been enormous, and his legacy continues to inspire people to raise awareness about the importance of maternal and infant health.</p><p>Furthermore, Erika Vélez also established the Ignacio Lasso Foundation in honor of her son, which aims to support families who have experienced perinatal asphyxia and provide them with the resources they need to cope with their loss. Through this foundation, Erika hopes to continue spreading awareness about the issue and to promote better access to quality healthcare for mothers and infants in Ecuador. Ignacio's legacy has inspired many people in Ecuador to get involved with children's rights and maternal health causes, and his influence continues to grow with each passing year. Although he may have only lived for one day, Ignacio Lasso left a lasting impact on his family and on the world, and his memory will never be forgotten.</p><p></p><p>
