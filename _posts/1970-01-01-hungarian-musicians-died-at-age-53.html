(February 2, 1487		Spišské Podhradie-July 22, 1540			Sebeș)

	
		also known as John Zapolya

	
was
a Hungarian
personality.


					
			
		His child
		is
		
		John Sigismund Zápolya.

						</p><p>John Zápolya was a renowned Hungarian Transylvanian nobleman, who served as the Voivode of Transylvania and later became King of Hungary. He was born on February 2, 1487, in the town of Spišské Podhradie, which is now a part of Slovakia. His father was Stephen Zápolya, and his mother was Barbara Cilli. </p><p>John Zápolya's career in politics began when he was appointed as Voivode of Transylvania by King Louis II of Hungary. He excelled in his role as Voivode and was respected by his people for his leadership and diplomatic skills. Later, when King Louis II died without an heir in 1526, a power vacuum was created in Hungary. In response, John Zápolya staked his claim to the throne and became the King of Hungary with the support of the Ottoman Empire.</p><p>However, John Zápolya's claim to the throne was challenged by Ferdinand I, who was backed by the Habsburg dynasty of Austria. Thus, Hungary was plunged into a period of political instability and warfare, known as the "Little War". It ended with a treaty signed in Nagyvárad, according to which John would be king of Hungary, while Ferdinand would control the western and northern parts of the kingdom.</p><p>Despite the various challenges he faced during his reign, John Zápolya continued to rule with dignity and honor until his death on July 22, 1540, in the town of Sebeș, now Romania. His legacy continued, however, through his son, John Sigismund Zápolya, who went on to become the first Prince of Transylvania.</p><p>John Zápolya was known for his strong alliances and for being a patron of the arts and sciences. He supported the works of Protestant theologians and helped to establish the Transylvanian Reformed Church. Additionally, he was a promoter of education and established a school for the Hungarian aristocracy. John Zápolya was also skilled in military strategy and was considered a formidable adversary by his enemies. His leadership played a pivotal role in protecting Hungary from foreign invasions during a time of great turmoil. Despite his many accomplishments, John Zápolya's reign was marked by struggle, and the instability that he faced during his time as king eventually led to the division of Hungary into three parts. Nevertheless, his place in Hungarian and Transylvanian history remains secure as a national hero who fought to protect his people and their way of life.</p><p></p><p>
