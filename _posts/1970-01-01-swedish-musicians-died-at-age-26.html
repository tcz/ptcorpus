(April 5, 1493-February 3, 1520			Mälaren)


was
a Swedish
personality.


					</p><p>Sten Sture the Younger was a Swedish statesman and nobleman who served as the regent of Sweden from 1512 until his death in 1520. He was the grandson of Sten Sture the Elder, another prominent Swedish nobleman who had also served as the regent of Sweden. Under Sten Sture the Younger's leadership, Sweden was able to maintain its independence from Denmark-Norway despite numerous attempts by the Danish King Christian II to regain control of the country. Sture was also known for his military prowess and led several successful campaigns against the Danes. His death in the Battle of Bogesund was a significant loss for Sweden and marked the end of the Sture family's long-standing influence in Swedish politics.</p><p>Sten Sture the Younger was born to the influential Sture family in 1493. His father, Svante Nilsson, who was the governor of the province of Uppland, died when he was only two years old. Sten Sture was then raised by his grandfather, Sten Sture the Elder, who had played a significant role in politics of Sweden, particularly in the struggle for Swedish independence.</p><p>Sten Sture the Younger gained political prominence early in his life and was appointed as the steward of the royal estates in 1508 at the tender age of 15. He became regent of Sweden four years later after the death of Erik Trolle, who was the incumbent regent at that time. Sweden was facing a crisis, as King Hans of Denmark-Norway had claimed the Swedish throne, and was trying to establish dominion over the country.</p><p>Sten Sture the Younger was a skilled military commander and led Sweden to several victories against Denmark-Norway, including the Battle of Brännkyrka and the Battle of Rotebro. However, his greatest triumph was in 1520 when Christian II invaded Sweden with an army of mercenaries, hoping to crush the Swedish rebellion. Sture's leadership, courage, and intelligence enabled Sweden to withstand the Danish threat and maintain its independence.</p><p>Unfortunately, Sten Sture the Younger's life was cut short in the Battle of Bogesund in 1520, where he died in a skirmish against the forces of Christian II. Despite his untimely death, Sten Sture the Younger's legacy looms large in the history of Sweden, as he was instrumental in preserving Sweden's independence and cementing the power of the Sture family in Swedish politics.</p><p>Sten Sture the Younger's death marked the beginning of a dark period in Swedish history known as the "Stockholm Bloodbath," where Christian II ordered the execution of several hundred people, including many of Sten Sture's supporters, in an effort to quell the rebellion. However, the brutal measures only served to increase resentment towards the Danish king and further solidify Sten Sture the Younger's place in Swedish folklore as a symbol of resistance and independence.</p><p>Sten Sture the Younger's legacy can also be seen in the numerous monuments and memorials that have been erected in his honor throughout the centuries. One of the most notable of these is the Sten Sture Monument, which stands in central Stockholm and depicts Sten Sture the Elder and Sten Sture the Younger standing side by side. Additionally, many streets, buildings, and schools throughout Sweden have been named after Sten Sture or members of his family.</p><p>Overall, Sten Sture the Younger played a pivotal role in Swedish history, both in terms of his military leadership and his political acumen. His unwavering dedication to preserving Swedish independence and his willingness to take bold action in the face of adversity have cemented his place as one of Sweden's most beloved historical figures.</p><p></p><p>
