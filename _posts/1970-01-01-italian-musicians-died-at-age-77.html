(April 5, 1566		Rome-December 30, 1643			Rome)


was
an Italian
artist, painter and visual artist.


					</p><p>Baglione was a prominent painter in his time, known for his dramatic Baroque style and his depictions of mythological and biblical scenes. He was a pupil of the famous painter Francesco Morelli and quickly gained a reputation as a talented artist. </p><p>Baglione was also known for his involvement in several controversies during his career. In 1603, he wrote a scathing critique of the painter Caravaggio, accusing him of immorality and blasphemy through his art. Baglione's own works were often criticized for being too theatrical and lacking in realism. </p><p>Despite these controversies, Baglione was a respected member of the art community in Rome and had many important patrons, including Pope Paul V. Today, his works can be found in the collections of major museums around the world, including the Louvre in Paris and the Vatican Museum in Rome.</p><p>In addition to his career as a painter, Giovanni Baglione also wrote a historical account of Renaissance art in Rome titled "Le Vite de' Pittori, Scultori et Architetti" (The Lives of Painters, Sculptors and Architects). This six-volume work is an important source of information for art historians and provides insight into the artistic milieu of Rome during the 16th and 17th centuries.</p><p>Baglione was also an important figure in the development of the Accademia di San Luca, a prestigious artists' guild in Rome. He served as its president from 1614-1623 and played a key role in establishing its reputation as a center of artistic excellence.</p><p>Throughout his career, Baglione was influenced by the works of other noted artists, including Annibale Carracci, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, and Guido Reni. His own style evolved over time, moving away from the heavy theatricality of his early works and towards a greater emphasis on naturalism and emotional expressiveness.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, however, Giovanni Baglione's life was not without its share of difficulties. He remained unmarried throughout his life and struggled with financial and health problems in his later years. Nevertheless, his legacy as a prominent Baroque painter and influential member of the Roman art community remains secure to this day.</p><p>In addition to his religious and mythological paintings, Baglione was also known for his portraits of prominent figures in Rome, including members of the clergy and aristocracy. His portrait of Pope Paul V can be seen in the Vatican Museum.</p><p>Baglione's involvement in the Caravaggio controversy did not end with his scathing critique. In 1603, he was involved in a brawl with Caravaggio and his supporters, resulting in the artist receiving a wound to his face. Baglione was later charged with attempted murder, but the charges were eventually dropped.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Baglione's later years were marred by financial difficulties and poor health. He suffered from gout and was partly paralyzed by a stroke in 1642. He died the following year at the age of 77 and was buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina in Rome.</p><p>In addition to his paintings and writings, Giovanni Baglione was also a skilled engraver. He created a number of etchings and engravings throughout his career, many of which were published in his own books or used to illustrate the works of other authors. Baglione was particularly interested in using engraving to reproduce the works of other artists, and he created a number of prints based on the paintings and drawings of Annibale Carracci and Guido Reni.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Baglione's reputation as an artist was somewhat overshadowed by his involvement in the Caravaggio controversy. His scathing critique of the artist, which accused him of blasphemy and immorality, helped to shape the public perception of Caravaggio's work for many years to come. However, Baglione's own contributions to the arts were significant, and his paintings continue to be admired for their dramatic power and emotional intensity.</p><p>One of Baglione's most notable works is the series of frescoes he painted on the ceiling of the Gesù church in Rome. Completed between 1608-1609, these frescoes depict scenes from the life of Christ and the history of the Jesuit order. The works are celebrated for their innovative use of geometric perspective and foreshortening, as well as their vivid colors and dramatic compositions. Today, the Gesù frescoes are considered some of the most important examples of Baroque art in Italy.
 
Baglione was also known for his skill as a draftsman and his detailed drawings, which often served as preliminary studies for his paintings. Some of his most impressive drawings depict complex scenes with multiple figures and elaborate architectural backgrounds.
 
In addition to his artistic pursuits, Baglione was also a devout Catholic and a member of several religious confraternities. He was known for his piety and often incorporated Christian themes into his art.
 
Despite his many accomplishments, Giovanni Baglione's reputation as an artist has been somewhat overshadowed by those of his contemporaries, including Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and Guido Reni. Nevertheless, his contributions to the art of the Baroque period are significant, and his works continue to be studied and admired by art historians and enthusiasts around the world.</p><p></p><p>
