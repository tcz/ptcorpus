was
an English
personality.


					</p><p>Anne of Bohemia was a member of the House of Luxembourg and the eldest daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Elizabeth of Pomerania. She married King Richard II of England in 1382, as part of a diplomatic alliance between England and Bohemia. Anne was known for her intelligence and cultural interests, particularly in literature and music. She played a role in encouraging the development of English literature, commissioning works by writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer. Anne and Richard II had no children, which had political implications for the stability of the English monarchy. After Anne's death, Richard II famously commissioned a tomb for her at Westminster Abbey, which was one of the most significant and elaborate royal tombs of the period.</p><p>Anne of Bohemia's marriage to Richard II was not only a diplomatic alliance but also a love match. The couple was said to have a deep affection for each other, with Richard II dedicating his book of love poems, "The Book of the Duchess," to Anne after her death. Anne was also a supporter of religious reform, particularly the teachings of John Wycliffe, and is believed to have owned a Bible translated into English, which was controversial at the time. Despite her short time as Queen of England, Anne's impact on English culture and literature is still felt today.</p><p>Anne of Bohemia was also a patron of the arts, supporting musicians and artists during her time as queen. She was well-educated and spoke several languages, including English, French, and German. Anne also had an interest in fashion, introducing new styles to the English court, such as the houppelande, a loose-fitting gown worn over a kirtle. </p><p>In addition to her cultural and artistic interests, Anne was involved in politics, acting as a mediator between her husband and other members of the royal court. She was known for her kindness and generosity, often donating to charitable causes, and was highly respected by the English people.</p><p>Although Anne of Bohemia's reign was relatively short-lived, she made a significant impact on English culture and society. Her legacy can be seen in the art, literature, and fashion of the time, as well as in her role as a patron and supporter of the arts. Her marriage to Richard II and her influence on politics and religion also had a lasting effect on the English monarchy.</p><p>After Anne's death, Richard II was said to have been deeply affected, and his grief may have contributed to his later downfall. A rebellion against Richard's rule in 1399 led to his deposition and subsequent imprisonment, where he died under mysterious circumstances. Despite the tumultuous end to her husband's reign, Anne of Bohemia remains a well-respected figure in English history. Her influence on literature and the arts, as well as her support of religious reform, continue to be celebrated and studied by scholars today.</p><p></p><p>

an English
personality.

		Clare Andrea Neilson.

						</p><p>Ruth Ellis was a model and nightclub hostess who gained notoriety for being the last woman to be hanged in the United Kingdom. Ellis was convicted of shooting her lover, David Blakely, outside a pub in London in 1955. Her trial and subsequent execution sparked controversy and public outcry, with many questioning the fairness and impartiality of the judicial system. Despite numerous appeals for clemency, including a petition signed by over 50,000 people, Ellis was hanged at HM Prison Holloway on July 13, 1955. Her case is still remembered as a symbol of the prejudice and injustice women faced in the mid-20th century.</p><p>Ruth Ellis was born in Rhyl, Wales in 1926. She had a troubled childhood and left school at the age of 14. She worked various jobs over the years, including as a waitress and a nightclub hostess, and became a well-known figure in London's social scene. She also worked as a semi-professional model and was featured in several magazines.</p><p>In 1950, Ruth married George Ellis, with whom she had a son named Andre. However, the marriage was short-lived and they divorced in 1952. After the divorce, Ruth continued working as a hostess and became involved with several wealthy and influential men. One of these men was David Blakely, a racing driver with whom Ruth had a turbulent and often violent relationship.</p><p>On April 10, 1955, Ruth shot and killed Blakely outside a pub in Hampstead, London. The shooting was witnessed by several people and Ruth was quickly arrested. She confessed to the crime and was charged with murder. Her trial took place at the Old Bailey in London, where she was found guilty and sentenced to death.</p><p>Despite the public outcry and protests against her execution, Ruth's appeals for clemency were denied. She was hanged at HM Prison Holloway on July 13, 1955. After her death, the case continued to be controversial and sparked debates around the use of capital punishment, as well as the treatment of women in the legal system.</p><p>In recent years, there have been several campaigns to overturn Ruth's conviction and posthumously clear her name, arguing that she was a victim of domestic violence and should have been charged with manslaughter instead of murder. Her case remains a poignant example of the complexities of justice and the continued fight for gender equality.</p><p>In addition to the controversy surrounding her case, Ruth Ellis is also remembered for her impact on British law. Her trial was a turning point in the way that domestic violence was viewed and addressed by the legal system. At the time, the concept of "battered woman syndrome" was not recognized, and it was common for victims of domestic violence to be dismissed or ignored by authorities. However, Ellis's case helped to bring attention to the issue and sparked important discussions about how the law should respond to victims of domestic abuse.</p><p>Beyond her legal and social legacy, Ruth Ellis's story also continues to capture the public imagination. She has been the subject of several books, films, and plays, and her tragic life and death have become part of British popular culture. Despite the passage of time, she remains a powerful symbol of the injustices faced by women and the need for greater understanding and compassion in the criminal justice system.</p><p>Ruth Ellis's tragic story has inspired several works of art, including a play titled "The Thrill of Love" by Amanda Whittington, which explores the events leading up to her decision to shoot Blakely. The play premiered in 2013 and has been performed in various theaters across the UK. Ellis has also been the subject of several documentaries and films, including a 1985 BBC drama titled "Dance with a Stranger" starring Miranda Richardson as Ellis. Additionally, in 2017, the Ruth Ellis Files: A Very British Crime Story aired on BBC Four, exploring the case and legacy of Ellis.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding her case, Ellis has been remembered as a complex and multidimensional figure. While some have criticized her actions and behavior, others have sympathized with her and highlighted the domestic abuse and psychological trauma she suffered at the hands of Blakely. Regardless of one's personal opinions about her, her case has had a profound impact on British society and legal history, and continues to be studied and debated by scholars and activists.</p><p></p><p>
