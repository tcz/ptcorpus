He became a follower of Martin Luther's teachings and was heavily influenced by the writings of William Tyndale. In 1523, he was appointed as the first Protestant minister in his hometown of Woerden.</p><p>De Bakker was known for his passionate and persuasive preaching, which drew large crowds and stirred controversy among the Catholic authorities. He was arrested several times and tried for heresy, but he always managed to escape with the help of his followers.</p><p>In 1525, De Bakker was captured again and, despite public protests, was sentenced to death by burning at the stake. His execution marked a turning point in the Dutch Reformation, as it galvanized the movement and boosted support for Protestantism throughout the country.</p><p>Jan de Bakker's legacy as a Protestant reformer continued to inspire and influence the Dutch Reformation long after his death. His writings and teachings were widely circulated and cited by other reformers, contributing to the growth of the movement in the Netherlands.In 1566, a group of Dutch nobles presented a petition to the governor requesting greater religious tolerance and the right to worship as Protestants.

He believed that the Bible should be accessible to everyone in their own language, and his translations helped to spread the ideas of the Reformation among the Dutch population. His translation of the New Testament was completed in 1524, and it was one of the earliest translations of the Bible into Dutch.</p><p>De Bakker's commitment to the Reformation and his willingness to die for his beliefs inspired many others to join the movement. His death was seen as a symbol of the Catholic Church's repression of religious freedom, and it helped to unite the Protestants in their struggle for reform.</p><p>Today, Jan de Bakker is commemorated with statues, monuments, and street names in many Dutch cities, and his legacy continues to inspire those who seek religious freedom and tolerance.</p><p></p><p>
