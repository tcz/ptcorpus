					</p><p>Vieira served as the President of Guinea-Bissau from 1980 to 1999 and again from 2005 to 2009. He played a key role in the country's fight for independence from Portugal in the 1960s and early 1970s. He was known for his autocratic leadership style and was accused of corruption and human rights abuses during his tenure as president. In 1999, he was overthrown in a military coup and went into exile, but returned to power in 2005 after winning a democratic election. His assassination in 2009 was believed to be linked to a feud with the military over control of the country's lucrative drug trade.</p><p>During his years in power, João Bernardo Vieira also faced numerous conflicts and uprisings, including a civil war in 1998 that left thousands dead and displaced even more. He played an instrumental role in the establishment of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), which is the country's leading political party. After his exile in 1999, Vieira spent his time in Portugal and other countries before returning to Guinea-Bissau to regain power. Despite his controversial legacy, Vieira was widely respected for his contributions to the country's fight for independence, and his assassination was seen as a significant loss for Guinea-Bissau.</p><p></p><p>
