(May 17, 1925		Chambéry-January 9, 1986			Paris)

	
		also known as Michel Certeau

	
was
a French
writer and philosopher.


					</p><p>His work focused on the intersection of culture and everyday life, and he is best known for his book "The Practice of Everyday Life." Certeau was a Jesuit scholar who taught at various universities in France and the United States. In addition to his philosophical work, he was also known for his studies of mysticism and religious experience. He was interested in understanding the ways in which individuals navigate and resist dominant cultural norms and structures, and his work has had a significant impact on fields such as cultural studies, anthropology, and history. Despite his contributions to scholarship, Certeau remained relatively unknown to the wider public until after his death, when his work gained wider recognition and appreciation.</p><p>Certeau was born on May 17, 1925, in Chambéry, a town in the French Alps. He received his education at the Jesuit school in Chantilly and later joined the Society of Jesus in 1944. He studied under some of the leading Catholic thinkers of his time and was ordained a Catholic priest in 1956.</p><p>Certeau's early work focused on theology and mysticism, drawing on the works of theologians such as St. Ignatius of Loyola, St. John of the Cross, and St. Teresa of Avila. In the 1960s, however, he turned his attention to broader social and cultural issues, and began to explore the ways in which individuals negotiate and subvert dominant cultural narratives and structures.</p><p>In 1970, Certeau published his most famous work, "The Practice of Everyday Life." This book, which has been translated into multiple languages, explores the ways in which individuals engage with and re-purpose cultural norms and institutions in their daily lives. The book has been influential in fields such as cultural studies, anthropology, geography, and history, and has helped to shape theories of resistance, agency, and power.</p><p>Despite his success as a writer and scholar, Certeau remained committed to his religious faith throughout his life. He continued to teach and write from a Jesuit perspective, and was involved in a number of theological and pastoral projects. He died in Paris in 1986, at the age of 60.</p><p>Throughout his career, Certeau was known for his interdisciplinary approach to scholarship, drawing on a wide range of fields and theories to develop his ideas. He was also a prolific writer, and his works include numerous articles, essays, and books. In addition to "The Practice of Everyday Life," some of his other notable works include "The Mystic Fable" and "The Writing of History." </p><p>Certeau's work has had a significant impact on both academic and popular discourse, and his ideas continue to be studied and discussed today. His focus on the agency and creativity of individuals in the face of dominant cultural structures has been particularly influential, helping to reshape understandings of power, resistance, and social change. Despite his significant contributions to scholarship, Certeau remained humble and dedicated to his work until his death, leaving behind a lasting legacy in the fields of philosophy, theology, and cultural studies.</p><p>Certeau's work has been widely praised for its innovation and originality, as well as for its relevance to contemporary society. His ideas have been applied to a wide range of fields, including urban studies, media studies, and literary studies, and have influenced scholars and thinkers around the world. His work on the practice of everyday life has been particularly influential, helping to shift the focus from grand narratives of history and politics to the more subtle and dynamic ways in which cultural change occurs. </p><p>Certeau's legacy also extends beyond his scholarly work to his personal reputation as a kind and generous person. He was admired by his colleagues and students for his humility, openness, and intellectual curiosity, and his death was widely mourned by those who knew him. Today, his intellectual contributions continue to inspire new generations of scholars and thinkers, and his work remains an important touchstone for those exploring the complex relationship between culture and everyday life.</p><p>Certeau's impact on scholarship extends beyond his own writing and research. He was also a dedicated teacher, and his work as a professor had a significant impact on the students who studied with him. Many of his former students went on to become prominent scholars and intellectuals themselves, continuing the legacy of Certeau's interdisciplinary approach to scholarship. Additionally, Certeau's work has been the subject of numerous conferences, workshops, and seminars, and his ideas continue to be debated and analyzed in academic settings around the world. In recognition of his contributions to philosophy and cultural studies, Certeau has been posthumously awarded numerous honors and prizes, including the prestigious Erasmus Prize in 1988. The legacy of Michel de Certeau continues to be felt today, as scholars and researchers continue to engage with his ideas and build upon his groundbreaking work.</p><p></p><p>

was
a French
writer, novelist, soldier and screenwriter.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Michel Bernanos and Yves Bernanos.

						</p><p>Described as a devout Roman Catholic, Bernanos often used his writing as a means of expressing his religious beliefs and social-political commentary. He gained popularity for his novels such as "Under Satan's Sun," "The Diary of a Country Priest," and "The Impostor," which were known for their vivid and unconventional characters. Bernanos also served in the French army during World War I, which heavily influenced his later works. He was also a critic of fascist ideology and wrote against it in newspapers and magazines during the 1930s. Despite his success as a writer, Bernanos struggled with financial issues and ill health throughout his life. He died of arteriosclerosis in 1948.</p><p>In addition to writing novels and essays, Georges Bernanos also worked as a screenwriter, contributing to films such as "Les Misérables" and "La Symphonie Pastorale." He was highly critical of the French Vichy regime during World War II and fled to Brazil in 1940, where he continued to publish work critical of the government. Even from a distance, he remained active in the French Resistance movement, using his writing to encourage others to join in the fight against fascism. After the war, he returned to France, where his works were highly regarded and he was awarded the Grand Prize for Literature. Today, Bernanos is remembered as one of the most important French writers of the 20th century, and his works continue to be widely read and studied.</p><p>Bernanos was born into a family of bourgeoisie, but he became an anarchist in his youth. However, he later moved towards Catholicism, and his faith remained central to his life and work. In 1936, he traveled to Spain during the civil war, where he supported the Republican cause against General Franco. He published a series of articles about his experiences in Spain, collected in the book "The Great Cemetery Under the Moon."</p><p>Bernanos was known for his blunt and often controversial views on society and politics. He was critical of both capitalism and communism and instead advocated for a more human-centered society. He believed strongly in the dignity of the individual and saw the Catholic Church as a means of promoting social justice.</p><p>In addition to his novels and essays, Bernanos also wrote poetry and plays, although these works are less well-known. He was also a gifted speaker and gave a number of lectures on literature and politics throughout his life.</p><p>Overall, Georges Bernanos is remembered as a writer who combined a deep faith with a passionate commitment to social justice. His works continue to be studied and admired by readers around the world.</p><p>Bernanos' work was also remembered for its impressive literary style and use of symbolism. In "The Diary of a Country Priest," for example, the main character's struggles with illness, faith, and loss are masterfully intertwined with larger themes of sin and redemption. His writing has been compared to that of other famous French authors such as Albert Camus and Marcel Proust, with whom he shares a dedication to exploring the complexities of the human experience.</p><p>Despite his political and religious convictions, Bernanos was known for his empathy and understanding of people from all walks of life. He was particularly interested in the experiences of the poor and marginalized, and often represented them in his writing. His work was seen as a call to action, urging readers to take a stand against injustice and oppression.</p><p>Today, Bernanos's legacy continues to inspire writers and readers around the world. His commitment to justice, his exploration of the human condition, and his literary style continue to make him a beloved figure in French literature and beyond.</p><p>During his lifetime, Georges Bernanos was a controversial figure due to his outspoken views on politics and society. He was critical of many aspects of modern life, including the rise of mass culture and the erosion of traditional values. He saw these changes as a threat to the dignity of the individual and believed that they needed to be opposed.</p><p>Bernanos was also a keen observer of international affairs, and he wrote extensively about the events unfolding in Europe during the 1930s. He was particularly outspoken about the rise of fascism in Germany and Italy, warning that these regimes posed a grave threat to freedom and democracy. His warnings went unheeded, however, and Europe was plunged into war in 1939.</p><p>Despite his opposition to fascism, Bernanos was also critical of the Allied powers during World War II. He believed that they were too focused on military victory and not enough on the human cost of the conflict. He saw the war as a tragedy for all involved, and he mourned the loss of life on both sides.</p><p>In addition to his literary and political work, Bernanos was also known for his personal life. He was married twice and had two children, but he also had several affairs throughout his life. He suffered from health problems throughout his life, and he died at the age of 60.</p><p>Today, Georges Bernanos is remembered as a literary giant and a fierce defender of social justice. His works continue to inspire readers around the world, and his legacy lives on in the countless writers and thinkers who have been influenced by his ideas.</p><p></p><p>

(October 4, 1814		Gréville-Hague-January 20, 1875			Barbizon)

	
		also known as Jean-Francois Millet, Jean Franois Millet or Jean-François Millet

	
was
a French
painter, artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is known for his depictions of rural life, particularly peasant farmers and their daily struggles. Millet's work was influential in the development of the Realist movement in art, which sought to portray the world as it truly was, rather than idealizing it or glorifying it. His most famous works include The Gleaners, The Angelus, and The Sower. Millet's paintings often featured a muted color palette and a sense of quiet contemplation, reflecting the rural lifestyle he so often portrayed. Despite facing criticism and controversy in his time, Millet's legacy continues to inspire and influence artists to this day.</p><p>Born into a family of farmers, Millet began drawing at a young age and went on to study art in Paris. He gained recognition for his work, but struggled financially for much of his career. Millet's art was seen as controversial by some critics for its depiction of peasants, who were typically overlooked by the art world. However, Millet's work was also praised for its humanism and empathy towards his subjects. In addition to his paintings, Millet was also skilled in drawing and printmaking. Today, his work is revered as some of the most heartfelt and authentic portrayals of rural life in the 19th century.</p><p>Millet's interest in art began at a young age, encouraged by his parents. He studied briefly at the Academie Suisse in Paris before beginning his career as an artist. His early works were largely portraits and genre scenes, but he found his true calling when he began to paint the rural landscapes and people of his native Normandy.</p><p>In the 1840s, Millet settled in the village of Barbizon, on the edge of the Forest of Fontainebleau. There, he joined a community of artists who were dedicated to painting from nature and rejecting the formalism of the art academy. Millet's paintings of peasant life became hugely popular, and he was praised for his ability to capture the dignity and humanity of his subjects.</p><p>Despite his success as a painter, Millet faced many challenges in his personal life. He suffered from chronic illness, and financial struggles forced him to sell many of his paintings for low prices. He also faced criticism from conservative critics who saw his work as too realistic and sympathetic to the poor.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Millet continued to paint until his death in 1875. His legacy as an artist and advocate for the rural poor has only grown in the years since his death, and his paintings continue to inspire and move viewers around the world.</p><p>Millet's impact on the art world of his time was significant. Along with other Realist painters like Gustave Courbet, Millet challenged the traditional conventions of the art establishment, which had previously focused on idealized and romanticized depictions of landscapes and people. He instead chose to paint the harsh realities of rural life, portraying his subjects with a sense of compassion and empathy.</p><p>Millet's work also had a lasting impact on later generations of artists, inspiring the development of the Social Realism movement in the United States in the early 20th century. His depictions of rural life and the struggles of the poor continue to be celebrated for their authenticity and emotional power.</p><p>In addition to his paintings, Millet was also a skilled draughtsman and printmaker. He created numerous sketches and studies of his subjects, which allowed him to capture the essence of his scenes with remarkable precision and detail. His work in these other mediums has also been highly influential, with later artists such as Vincent van Gogh admiring his drawing and printmaking techniques.</p><p>Today, Millet is widely regarded as one of the greatest painters of the 19th century. His ability to capture the beauty and dignity of rural life has earned him a lasting place in the canon of Western art, and his work continues to inspire artists and viewers alike.</p><p>Millet was also a dedicated family man, marrying Pauline-Virginie Ono in 1853 and having nine children with her. His family often served as models for his paintings, including his wife who appeared in several of his works, such as The Angelus. Despite his struggles with illness and finances, Millet remained deeply committed to his art and the humanity of his subjects. He once said, "I want to leave to posterity a souv enir of the people of my time and the land in which I lived." Millet's legacy is a testament to his commitment to portraying the reality of rural life with compassion and beauty.</p><p></p><p>

lawyer.


					</p><p>He was a prominent figure during the French Revolution, serving as a member of the Committee of Public Safety and as a delegate to the National Convention. Rewbell was also a key organizer of the coup against the Girondins in 1793. He later served in various government positions including as a member of the Council of Ancients and as director of the Bank of France. In addition to his political career, Rewbell was a respected jurist and author. He wrote several legal treatises and was known for his expertise in commercial law. Despite his many accomplishments, Rewbell remained a controversial figure due to his involvement in the Reign of Terror and his strong support of the radical Jacobin faction.</p><p>Rewbell's involvement in the Reign of Terror led to his eventual fall from power. He was arrested in 1795 and imprisoned for several months before being released due to a lack of evidence. After his release, Rewbell retired from public life and returned to his legal career. He continued to write and publish works on commercial law and civil procedure until his death in 1807. Despite his controversial political legacy, Rewbell's contributions to French law and governance during the Revolution cannot be overstated. His legal expertise and political acumen were highly valued by his contemporaries, and his influence can still be seen in modern French law and government.</p><p>Rewbell was born into a wealthy family in Colmar, Alsace. He received a classical education before studying law in Strasbourg and Paris. He gained a reputation as a skilled lawyer and was elected to the Estates General in 1789. During the Revolution, Rewbell aligned himself with the radical Jacobins and became a prominent member of the Committee of Public Safety. He played a key role in the suppression of counter-revolutionary uprisings and the execution of King Louis XVI. </p><p>Rewbell's political views and actions drew criticism from some of his contemporaries, including other revolutionaries.

He was known for his love of literature and philosophy, and often incorporated these interests into his legal writings. Rewbell was a strong believer in the ideals of the Enlightenment, and saw the French Revolution as a means of advancing these ideals. He sought to create a new legal system that was based on reason and equality, rather than tradition and aristocratic privilege. Despite his radical views, Rewbell was also known for his pragmatism and ability to work with others to achieve his goals. He maintained close relationships with several other key figures in the French government, including Lazare Carnot and the Marquis de Lafayette. Rewbell's legacy continues to inspire scholars and policymakers today, particularly in the areas of commercial law and constitutional governance.</p><p>During his time on the Committee of Public Safety, Jean-Francois Rewbell played a key role in the development of the French Revolutionary government's policies. He was a strong proponent of the use of terror as a means of suppressing counter-revolutionary forces and maintaining order in the country. Rewbell also worked to centralize the government's power, advocating for the creation of a national police force and the establishment of a system of surveillance to monitor potential enemies of the Revolution. </p><p>After the fall of Robespierre and the end of the Reign of Terror, Rewbell continued to be involved in French politics. He served as a member of the Council of Ancients and helped to negotiate the Treaty of Campo Formio, which ended the Revolutionary Wars and marked a significant victory for France. Rewbell also played a key role in the establishment of the Bank of France, serving as its director from 1801 until his death in 1807.</p><p>In addition to his legal and political work, Rewbell was a patron of the arts and a collector of books and manuscripts. His personal library was considered one of the finest in France, and included rare works by prominent philosophers and scholars of the Enlightenment. Rewbell was also a member of several literary and philosophical societies and corresponded with leading intellectuals of his time, including Immanuel Kant and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Jean-Francois Rewbell remains an important figure in French history. His contributions to the development of French jurisprudence and governmental policy continue to be studied by scholars today, and his legacy is recognized as a significant part of the country's cultural heritage.</p><p></p><p>

(September 28, 1698		Saint-Malo-July 27, 1759			Basel)

	
		also known as Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis or Maupertuis

	
was
a French
scientist, mathematician and astronomer.


					</p><p>He is known for his contributions to the field of geodesy, or the study of the Earth's shape, as well as his work on the principle of least action in physics. Maupertuis' most famous expedition was to Lapland in the 1730s, where he led a team of scientists to measure the length of a degree of latitude in order to calculate the shape of the Earth. He also published several important works on mathematics, optics, and astronomy, and was a member of the Royal Society and the Berlin Academy of Sciences. Despite his achievements, Maupertuis often had a contentious personality and was involved in several public disputes, including one with philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</p><p>After the Lapland expedition, Maupertuis became the director of the Académie des Sciences of Berlin, where he continued his work on geodesy and became involved in controversies with fellow scientists regarding the principles of calculus. In addition to his scientific pursuits, Maupertuis was also interested in philosophy and wrote extensively on the topic of determinism, arguing that all events in the universe, including human behavior, are ultimately deterministic and driven by physical laws. This idea was controversial at the time and drew criticism from philosophers such as Voltaire. Despite his polarizing personality and ideas, Maupertuis remains an important figure in the history of mathematics and science for his contributions to geodesy and physics.</p><p>Maupertuis was born into a noble family in Saint-Malo, France. He showed an early aptitude for mathematics and was sent to Paris to study at the Collège Royal. He soon became a member of various scientific societies, including the Royal Society in London and the Academy of Sciences in Paris. In addition to his work in geodesy, he made significant contributions to the field of genetics, proposing a theory of heredity that prefigured some of the ideas of Charles Darwin.</p><p>Maupertuis' influence on the scientific world of the eighteenth century was significant, and his work laid the foundation for many later developments. His emphasis on the importance of empirical observation and measurement, as well as his understanding of the fundamental role of mathematics in scientific inquiry, were key contributions to the emerging scientific method.</p><p>Despite his brilliance as a scientist, Maupertuis was frequently in conflict with others in his field, and his controversial ideas and combative personality often led to heated debates and public arguments. Nevertheless, his contributions to the field of geodesy and to the development of modern physics and mathematics remain of lasting importance.</p><p>Maupertuis' early life was marked by tragedy, as he lost both of his parents at a young age. He was then raised by his uncle, who recognized his talent for mathematics and encouraged his education. Maupertuis went on to attend the University of Rennes, where he studied law and mathematics, before embarking on his scientific career.</p><p>In addition to his scientific pursuits, Maupertuis was also a notable figure in the social and cultural circles of his day. He was known for his wit and charm, and he frequently corresponded with other prominent intellectuals of the time, including Voltaire and Diderot. He also maintained close ties with the French royal court and was a frequent guest at the court of King Louis XV.</p><p>Despite his controversial ideas, Maupertuis was widely respected for his scientific achievements and was honored with numerous awards and accolades during his lifetime. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of mathematics and physics and as a pioneer in the field of geodesy.</p><p>Maupertuis' Lapland expedition in the 1730s was a groundbreaking moment in the study of geodesy. He led a team of scientists to measure the length of a degree of latitude at two different points in Lapland, in order to calculate the shape of the Earth. The results of the expedition, which were published in his book "Figure of the Earth," proved that the Earth is flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator, confirming the work of Isaac Newton and paving the way for further study of the Earth's shape and gravity. </p><p>In addition to his work in geodesy, Maupertuis made significant contributions to the field of mathematics. He was a proponent of Newton's calculus, and he introduced the principle of least action to physics, which states that a system will always choose the path of least resistance. He also wrote important works on optics, including "Essays on Optics," which explored the nature of light and color. </p><p>Maupertuis' intellectual pursuits extended beyond his scientific research. He was a prolific writer on a variety of topics, including philosophy, literature, and politics. His philosophical ideas, including determinism and skepticism, were controversial at the time but have since come to be appreciated for their insights into the nature of reality and human behavior. </p><p>Overall, Maupertuis remains an important figure in the history of science and philosophy, and his contributions continue to influence modern scientific research and inquiry.</p><p></p><p>
