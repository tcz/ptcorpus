							Hayakawa left Japan for the United States in 1913 and became a silent film star, known for his roles in films such as "The Cheat" and "The Dragon Painter." He was one of the highest-paid actors of his time and became the first Asian-American leading man in Hollywood. However, because of racism and discrimination, Hayakawa eventually left Hollywood to pursue his own production company and even returned to Japan to make films. He continued to act and produce films until his death in 1973, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering Asian-American actor and filmmaker. Beyond his work in film, Hayakawa was also a man of great cultural and intellectual stature, publishing articles and books on Japanese art and culture, and was a political activist who fought for Asian-American rights.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=845665" title="Wikipedia article about Sessue Hayakawa">Sessue Hayakawa on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/pakistani-actresses-died-at-age-74.html' title='Pakistani actresses died at age 74'><strong>Pakistani actresses died at age 74</strong> List of the top 1 Pakistani actresses who died when they were 74</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-intracranial-aneurysm.html' title='Famous actors died in Intracranial aneurysm'><strong>Famous actors died in Intracranial aneurysm</strong> List of the top 2 Famous actors who died in Intracranial aneurysm</a></li><li><a href='/swiss-actresses-died-in-1974.html' title='Swiss actresses died in 1974'><strong>Swiss actresses died in 1974</strong> List of the top 1 Swiss actresses who died in 1974</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/thai-actors-born-in-1977.html' title='Thai actors born in 1977'><strong>Thai actors born in 1977</strong> List of the top 11 Thai actors who were born in 1977</a></li><li><a href='/british-actresses-died-at-age-79.html' title='British actresses died at age 79'><strong>British actresses died at age 79</strong> List of the top 11 British actresses who died when they were 79</a></li><li><a href='/spanish-actresses-died-in-1988.html' title='Spanish actresses died in 1988'><strong>Spanish actresses died in 1988</strong> List of the top 1 Spanish actresses who died in 1988</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
