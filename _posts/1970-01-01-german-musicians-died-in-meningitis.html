									</h1><p>Here are 1 famous musicians from Germany died in Meningitis:</p><h2>Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld</h2><p><strong>Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld</strong>
(July 2, 1836		Munich-July 21, 1865)


was
a German
singer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his portrayal of Tristan in Richard Wagner's opera "Tristan und Isolde", which premiered in Munich in 1865. Schnorr married the soprano Malvina Garrigues, who also sang the role of Isolde in that same production. The couple's performance was highly acclaimed, but tragically, Ludwig died just a few weeks later from a fever that was likely exacerbated by the strain of his intense singing schedule. Despite his brief career, Schnorr's contribution to the development of the Wagnerian style of singing was significant, and his legacy continues to be celebrated by opera enthusiasts around the world.</p><p>In addition to his renown as a Wagnerian singer, Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld was also recognized for his interpretation of Mozart's Don Giovanni. He initially trained as a violinist, but later switched to vocal studies under the tutelage of Georg Henschel, a prominent singer and conductor at the time. Schnorr made his debut as a baritone, but later switched to the tenor range, which was more suited to his vocal abilities. In addition to Munich, he performed in other German cities such as Dresden and Frankfurt, but his international career was cut short by his premature death at the age of 29. Many opera lovers consider his early passing to be one of the great tragedies of the 19th century music scene.</p><p></p><p>
