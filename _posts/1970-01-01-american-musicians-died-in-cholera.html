an American
jazz pianist and musician.


					</p><p>He was born in Pocahontas, Virginia and began playing piano at a very young age. In the 1920s, he moved to Asia and started playing in various venues across the continent. He gained widespread popularity in Shanghai, where he became the first African-American musician to lead a house band in a hotel. </p><p>Weatherford played with some of the biggest names in jazz, including Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Coleman Hawkins. He also developed a unique style that blended jazz with various Eastern musical elements. </p><p>During World War II, Weatherford and his family were interned by the Japanese in the Santo Tomas Internment Camp in the Philippines. Despite the difficult conditions, he continued to play music and even organized bands within the camp. </p><p>Unfortunately, Weatherford's life was cut short when he died of a heart attack in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) at the age of 41.

He was also a gifted arranger, and his arrangements often incorporated local styles and instruments, such as the Chinese erhu and Indian sitar. After the war, several of his recordings were released, including "Shanghai Shuffle" and "Indian Boogie Woogie", which showcased his unique style. Additionally, Weatherford was known for his philanthropic work, and during his time in Shanghai he often played benefit concerts for local charities. Today, he is recognized as a pioneer of jazz in Asia and a trailblazer for African-Americans in the music industry. In 1999, he was posthumously inducted into the Arkansas Jazz Hall of Fame.</p><p></p><p>
