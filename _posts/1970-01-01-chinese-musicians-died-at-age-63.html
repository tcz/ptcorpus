(December 5, 1907		Huanggang-September 13, 1971			Öndörkhaan)

	
		otherwise known as Lin Yurong or Biao Lin

	
was
a Chinese
politician and soldier.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Lin Liguo and Lin Liheng.

						</p><p>Lin Biao was one of the closest and most influential allies of Mao Zedong, and played a key role in the Chinese Communist Party's rise to power in China. He was a veteran of the Long March, and served as a high-ranking military commander during the Chinese Civil War, the Korean War, and the early years of the People's Republic of China. Lin also spearheaded the Cultural Revolution movement, and was widely regarded as Mao's designated successor to lead the Chinese Communist Party after his death. However, he fell out of favor with Mao in the late 1960s, and died in a mysterious plane crash while attempting to flee to the Soviet Union. The exact circumstances of his death remain shrouded in secrecy and controversy to this day.</p><p>Despite his close relationship with Mao Zedong, Lin Biao became disillusioned with Mao's direction for China in the late 1960s. He was accused of plotting a coup against Mao and was subsequently purged from the Communist Party. Lin Biao's sudden and mysterious death only added to the speculation surrounding his fall from grace. Some theories suggest that he was attempting to defect to the Soviet Union due to his disagreements with Mao's policies, while others suggest that his death was a result of a power struggle within the Communist Party. Regardless of the cause, Lin Biao's legacy remains complex and controversial in China, with some seeing him as a hero of the Chinese Revolution, and others viewing him as a traitor and enemy of the Communist Party.</p><p>Lin Biao's military career began in the late 1920s when he joined the Red Army, the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a trusted deputy of Mao Zedong. During the Long March, Lin served as the commander of a brigade and was responsible for leading his troops through some of the most difficult terrain in China.</p><p>After the Communist Party's victory in the Chinese Civil War, Lin Biao became one of the most prominent military figures in the country. He was instrumental in the Chinese military's participation in the Korean War and played a key role in creating China's nuclear weapons program.</p><p>In addition to his military career, Lin Biao was also a key political figure in Mao Zedong's inner circle. He was a proponent of Mao's extreme leftist policies and was a key figure in the launch of the Cultural Revolution in 1966.</p><p>Despite his close relationship with Mao, Lin Biao became increasingly critical of Mao's policies in the late 1960s. He saw Mao's attempts to expand the Cultural Revolution as a threat to China's stability and believed that Mao was becoming too dictatorial. In 1971, Lin Biao was accused of plotting to assassinate Mao and overthrow the Communist Party. He was purged from his position and fled the country, but died in a plane crash while attempting to reach the Soviet Union.</p><p>Lin Biao's legacy remains controversial in China today. Some view him as a hero of the Chinese Revolution, while others see him as a traitor and enemy of the Communist Party. The circumstances surrounding his death and fall from grace continue to be a subject of speculation and debate.</p><p></p><p>
