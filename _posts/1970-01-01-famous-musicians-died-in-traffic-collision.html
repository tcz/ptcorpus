(March 8, 1937		Brooklyn-April 30, 1966			Carmel-by-the-Sea)

	
		a.k.a. Richard Farina or Fariña, Richard

	
was
an American
writer, novelist and singer.


					</p><p>He was best known for his novel "Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me," which is considered a cult classic of the 1960s counterculture. Farina was also an accomplished musician and performed with his wife, Mimi Farina, as part of the duo Richard & Mimi Farina. Together, they recorded two albums and were a popular act on the folk music scene. In addition to his writing and musical endeavors, Farina was also a political activist and was heavily involved in the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s. Sadly, Farina's life was cut short when he died in a motorcycle accident at the age of 29.</p><p>Before becoming a writer and musician, Richard Fariña attended Cornell University where he studied literature and language. While he was in college, he wrote and edited for the literary magazine, The Cornell Writer. After graduating, he moved to Europe and traveled extensively throughout the continent, which inspired some of the settings and characters in his writing. During this time, he also became interested in music and began playing the guitar and writing songs. In 1963, he married Mimi Baez, the younger sister of singer Joan Baez, and they soon began performing together as a duo. Their music was heavily influenced by folk and blues traditions, and they were known for their intricate guitar playing and tight harmonies. Richard & Mimi Farina released their first album, "Celebrations for a Grey Day," in 1965, followed by "Reflections in a Crystal Wind" in 1966, the year that Richard died. Despite his short career, Richard Fariña's writing and music continue to inspire new generations of artists and fans.</p><p>Richard Fariña's writing style was often described as whimsical and inventive, blending elements of satire and surrealism. "Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me," his most famous work, tells the story of a young man's experiences in the counterculture of the 1960s and has been compared to works by Jack Kerouac and Thomas Pynchon. Fariña was also a prolific writer of poetry and short stories, which were published in magazines such as The Atlantic Monthly and The Paris Review.</p><p>As a political activist, Fariña was involved in a number of causes related to social justice, including civil rights and anti-war efforts. He was a regular participant in protests and demonstrations, and his writing often reflected his political views. In fact, some of his songs, such as "Birmingham Sunday," have been recognized as important contributions to the protest music genre.</p><p>Fariña's death was a great loss to the literary and music communities, and many have speculated about what he might have accomplished had he lived longer. Nevertheless, his contributions to both fields continue to be celebrated by fans and scholars alike.</p><p></p><p>

novelist, writer, poet and author.


					</p><p>He is perhaps best known for writing the lyrics of "Lift Every Voice and Sing," a song that later became known as the "Negro National Anthem." Johnson was also an important figure in the NAACP and served as its leader from 1920-1930. He was the first African-American to pass the bar exam in Florida and was a prominent figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Some of his notable works include "The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man," "God's Trombones," and "Black Manhattan." Johnson was also a diplomat, serving as the United States Consul in Venezuela and Nicaragua. His legacy as an influential writer and civil rights activist continues to inspire and influence new generations.</p><p>In addition to his many achievements, James Weldon Johnson was also a talented educator, serving as a principal at a number of African-American schools during his career. He graduated from Atlanta University with a degree in literature and a teaching certificate, and later went on to receive a law degree from the same university. As a writer, Johnson was known for his powerful and evocative style, which often dealt with issues of race, inequality, and the African-American experience. He was also a gifted songwriter and musician, composing a number of popular songs during his lifetime, including "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen" and "Deep River." Despite facing significant social and political obstacles during his career, Johnson remained committed to fighting for civil rights and promoting social justice until his death in 1938.</p><p>Johnson's impact on both literature and civil rights activism has continued to be significant over time. He is often credited with introducing the concept of the "New Negro" to the public consciousness, which emphasized African-American pride and empowerment in the face of racism and oppression. His works, particularly "The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man," have been praised for their insightful and psychologically complex characterizations of African-American individuals.</p><p>Throughout his life, Johnson remained dedicated to social justice and worked tirelessly to secure civil rights for his community. He fought against racial segregation in the education system, and played a key role in the landmark court case that ultimately led to the integration of schools in the United States. His leadership within the NAACP helped to establish the organization as a powerful force in the fight for civil rights, and his diplomatic work helped to promote peace and stability in Central and South America.</p><p>Johnson's legacy has continued to be recognized in the years following his death. In 1988, the U.S. Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp in honor of his contributions to American culture, and in 2002, Jacksonville University established the James Weldon Johnson Institute for the Study of Race and Difference, which aims to promote scholarship and education on issues related to race, diversity, and social justice.</p><p></p><p>
