(December 9, 1913		Mpumalanga-March 20, 1993)


was
a South African
artist, visual artist, musician and music artist.


						</p><p>He is best known for his contributions to the art form known as "township art", where he depicted scenes of everyday life in the townships of South Africa during the apartheid era. Despite facing discrimination and economic hardship as a black artist, Sekoto was able to gain recognition and critical acclaim for his work both in South Africa and internationally. In addition to his visual art, Sekoto was also a talented musician who played the piano and trumpet. He spent the last years of his life in Paris, where he continued to create art until his death in 1993. Today, his works are held in collections around the world, and he is considered an important figure in the history of South African art.</p><p>Sekoto was born in a small village called Botshabelo in Mpumalanga, South Africa. He was a self-taught artist, and started drawing and painting at a young age. In the 1930s, Sekoto moved to Johannesburg in search of work as a musician and artist. He quickly became involved in the vibrant cultural scene of the city, and began to create works that depicted life in the townships.</p><p>In 1940, Sekoto held his first solo exhibition, which was well-received by both critics and the public. However, his career suffered setbacks due to his skin color and legal restrictions during apartheid. He struggled financially for many years, earning a living by playing music and selling his paintings on the streets.</p><p>In 1947, Sekoto left South Africa and moved to Paris, where he was eventually granted political asylum. He continued to create artwork in the city, and gained recognition for his work both in France and internationally. Sekoto's work often depicted themes of displacement and longing, and he incorporated elements of both African and European artistic traditions into his paintings.</p><p>Sekoto's legacy continues to be celebrated in South Africa today. In 2003, the Gerard Sekoto Foundation was established to promote and preserve his work, and his artworks have been featured in major exhibitions and retrospectives around the world.</p><p>Sekoto's impact on South African art has been significant. His artwork has become a symbol of the resistance against apartheid and his emphasis on everyday life in townships has helped to document the often neglected experiences of black South Africans. In addition to his visual art and music, Sekoto was also a poet and wrote extensively about his experiences growing up in South Africa. His poetry has been published posthumously, contributing to his reputation as a multifaceted artist. In 1989, he was awarded the Order of Ikhamanga, a national honor bestowed by the South African government in recognition of his contribution to the arts. Today, Sekoto's work continues to inspire and influence South African artists, reminding us of the power of art to document and resist injustice.</p><p></p><p>

a French
novelist, writer and singer.


						</p><p>She was born in Tunis to a Kabyle family and spent much of her childhood in Algeria.

Her father, a progressive thinker and activist, raised his children in a multilingual and eclectic household where the family's Berber traditions were celebrated alongside French and Arabic languages and customs. Despite facing discrimination and resistance from both French colonial authorities and conservative Arab-Muslim communities, Amrouche embraced her Kabyle heritage and became a voice for cultural diversity and tolerance.</p><p>In addition to her literary and musical achievements, Taos Amrouche was also a respected intellectual and advocate for human rights. She contributed articles and essays to various magazines and journals on topics such as the Algerian War of Independence, anti-colonialism, and feminism.
