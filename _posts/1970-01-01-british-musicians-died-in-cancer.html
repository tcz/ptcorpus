He is remembered as a pioneering figure who brought drag into the mainstream and paved the way for future generations of LGBTQ+ performers.</p><p>La Rue was born in Cork, Ireland, and named Daniel Patrick Carroll. He was one of six children and grew up in poverty. When La Rue was just nine years old, his father passed away, leaving his mother to raise the family alone. Despite the challenges he faced as a child, La Rue developed a keen interest in performing from an early age. He began dressing up in his sister's clothes and putting on shows for his siblings, honing the skills that would eventually make him a star.</p><p>At the age of 16, La Rue left Ireland and moved to England to pursue a career in show business.
