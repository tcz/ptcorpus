							Negrete was one of the most popular Mexican icons of the 1940s and 1950s. He began his career as a singer in 1931 and quickly gained fame for his powerful voice and traditional Mexican ranchera music. Negrete also acted in numerous Mexican films, earning critical acclaim for his performances. He was known for his strong, masculine presence and his ability to portray the quintessential Mexican charro (cowboy) on screen.</p><p>Negrete helped to popularize Mexican music and culture both nationally and internationally. His 1946 film "¡Ay, Jalisco, no te rajes!" became one of the highest-grossing films in Mexican history and helped to establish him as a beloved cultural figure. He went on to star in many more films, including "El Peñón de las Ánimas" and "Han matado a Tongolele."</p><p>Despite his immense popularity, Negrete was also a controversial figure. He was criticized for his support of the Mexican government, particularly during the dictatorship of President Miguel Alemán Valdés. Negrete's politics and his close relationship with the government led to accusations of censorship and propaganda.</p><p>Negrete died at the young age of 42 due to a cirrhotic liver, which some attributed to his heavy drinking. His legacy as a cultural icon and musical legend endures to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=1828359" title="Wikipedia article about Jorge Negrete">Jorge Negrete on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/turkish-actors-died-in-2001.html' title='Turkish actors died in 2001'><strong>Turkish actors died in 2001</strong> List of the top 2 Turkish actors who died in 2001</a></li><li><a href='/hongkongese-actors-died-in-renal-failure.html' title='Hongkongese actors died in Renal failure'><strong>Hongkongese actors died in Renal failure</strong> List of the top 1 Hongkongese actors who died in Renal failure</a></li><li><a href='/bulgarian-actors-died-in-2014.html' title='Bulgarian actors died in 2014'><strong>Bulgarian actors died in 2014</strong> List of the top 1 Bulgarian actors who died in 2014</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/russian-actors-born-in-1970.html' title='Russian actors born in 1970'><strong>Russian actors born in 1970</strong> List of the top 22 Russian actors who were born in 1970</a></li><li><a href='/norwegian-actors-died-in-traffic-collision.html' title='Norwegian actors died in Traffic collision'><strong>Norwegian actors died in Traffic collision</strong> List of the top 1 Norwegian actors who died in Traffic collision</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actors-died-at-age-27.html' title='Indian actors died at age 27'><strong>Indian actors died at age 27</strong> List of the top 3 Indian actors who died when they were 27</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
