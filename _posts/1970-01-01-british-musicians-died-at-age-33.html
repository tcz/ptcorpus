(August 8, 1914		United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland-May 28, 1948			Oban)


was
a British
personality.


					</p><p>Unity Mitford was a British socialite and one of the Mitford sisters, a group of siblings who were well-known for their active social lives and political views. Unity was particularly drawn to the far-right politics of Nazi Germany and became a close friend of Adolf Hitler. She even made an attempt on her own life, shooting herself in the head in 1939 after Britain declared war on Germany. Despite surviving the suicide attempt, she suffered lasting brain damage and spent the rest of her life in care. She died in Scotland in 1948, reportedly from meningitis.</p><p>Unity Mitford was born in London, England and was the daughter of Baron Redesdale. She grew up in a wealthy and privileged family, and her sister Nancy Mitford would go on to become a well-known author. Unity's fascination with Nazi Germany began in the early 1930s, when she attended a Nazi rally in London and was immediately drawn to the charismatic figure of Adolf Hitler. </p><p>In 1934, Unity traveled to Germany for the first time and became even more enamoured with the Nazi ideology. She was a frequent visitor to Germany throughout the 1930s, and was known to attend rallies and events with high-ranking Nazi officials. Unity was even present at Hitler's infamous beer hall putsch in 1934, which was a failed coup attempt to overthrow the government of Bavaria. </p><p>After the outbreak of World War II, Unity became increasingly distressed by the growing tensions between Britain and Germany. She believed that she had a personal connection to Hitler and that he would never harm her, but after Britain declared war on Germany, she became despondent and depressed. In 1939, she attempted to commit suicide by shooting herself in the head in a park in Munich. </p><p>Although Unity survived the suicide attempt, she was left with permanent brain damage and partial paralysis. She was flown back to England, where she was cared for by her family and eventually moved to a nursing home in Scotland. She died at the age of 33 from complications related to her injuries, and her death was attributed to meningitis. Despite her tragic end, Unity Mitford remains a fascinating figure in history, who was both a victim and a supporter of one of the most notorious regimes of the 20th century.</p><p>Unity Mitford's close association with Nazi Germany and her suicide attempt made her a controversial figure both during her lifetime and in the years since her death. Her family tried to downplay her political beliefs and her connection to Hitler, and some historians have argued that her interest in Nazism was driven more by a desire for attention than by any ideological commitment. However, others have pointed to her extensive writings and personal letters as evidence of her genuine admiration for Hitler and his regime.</p><p>Despite her troubled personal history, Unity Mitford remains a subject of fascination for many people today. Her story has been the subject of numerous books and articles, and she has been portrayed in film and television dramas. One reason for this enduring interest may be the mystery that still surrounds her motivations and beliefs. Whatever the truth about Unity Mitford's political views, her life and death offer a poignant reminder of the destructive power of ideology and the tragedy of lost potential.</p><p></p><p>
