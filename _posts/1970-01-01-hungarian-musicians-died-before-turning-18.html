However, his rule was faced with opposition from the Hungarian nobility, who didn't favor a foreign ruler. In 1301, his father abdicated the Bohemian throne in his favor, and Wenceslaus III also became King of Bohemia. </p><p>Unfortunately, his reign was short-lived. In 1305, he was assassinated in Olomouc, Moravia, at the age of 16. The circumstances surrounding his murder are still unclear, but it is believed to have been politically motivated. With his death, the male line of the Přemyslid dynasty came to an end, and the Bohemian and Hungarian thrones passed to other dynasties.</p><p></p><p>
