(December 6, 1841		Montpellier-November 28, 1870			Beaune-la-Rolande)

	
		otherwise known as Frederic Bazille, Jean Frédéric Bazille or Frdric Bazille

	
was
a French
painter, artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He was born into a wealthy family and initially pursued a career in medicine at Montpellier University. However, he decided to follow his passion for art and moved to Paris to study painting. Bazille was influenced by the Impressionist movement and befriended several famous artists like Claude Monet and Édouard Manet. He was known for his outdoor scenes, particularly figures in landscapes, and he captured the effects of light and atmosphere in his work. Unfortunately, Bazille's promising career was cut short when he was killed in action during the Franco-Prussian War at the age of 28. Despite his short life, he made significant contributions to the Impressionist movement and his works are now highly regarded in the art world.</p><p>Bazille's most famous works include "The Family Reunion" (1867), which features his family members in a garden setting, and "Studio 9 rue de la Condamine" (1870), which depicts his fellow Impressionist artists at work in their studio. He also created several portraits, including one of his close friend Renoir, and experimented with different mediums such as lithography and etching. Unfortunately, much of Bazille's work was lost after his death, as he had not yet gained widespread recognition. However, his legacy has been recognized in recent years, and his paintings have been the subject of several exhibitions around the world. Today, Bazille is remembered as a key figure in the development of the Impressionist style, and his contributions to the art world continue to be celebrated.</p><p></p><p>

(April 13, 1766-April 5, 1795)


was
a French
lawyer and politician.


					</p><p>Jean-Marie Claude Alexandre Goujon was born in the town of Lannion, in Brittany, France. He was educated in Paris, where he studied law and became a successful lawyer. During the French Revolution, he became actively involved in politics and was elected to the National Convention in 1792. As a member of the Convention, he supported the execution of King Louis XVI and was a key player in the downfall of Maximilien Robespierre. </p><p>However, Goujon's political career was cut short when he was arrested by the Jacobin government in 1794. He spent several months in prison before being released in January 1795. Shortly after his release, he tragically committed suicide by drowning himself in the Seine River. The reasons for his suicide remain unknown, although it is believed that he may have been struggling with mental illness or the trauma of his imprisonment. Despite his short life, Goujon is remembered as an important figure in the French Revolution and a passionate defender of radical democracy.</p><p>Goujon was married twice during his lifetime. His first wife, Marie Anne Josèphe Lhuillier, whom he married in 1787, died in 1792, leaving behind two children. He remarried in 1793 to Alexandrine Filleul, who was the widow of a guillotined deputy. Goujon was also known for his passion for literature and the arts, and he frequently attended the salons of prominent figures in Parisian society. He was particularly interested in the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and was an avid collector of his works. After his death, Goujon's political writings and speeches were published in a collection entitled "Œuvres de Goujon" and were much celebrated in radical circles. His legacy continues to be debated and discussed by historians and political scholars to this day.</p><p></p><p>
