		children,
		Virginia Kahn and Peter W. Kahn.

							</p><p>Born to a wealthy family, Roger Wolfe Kahn started playing the piano at a young age and was trained by several renowned tutors. His father, Otto Kahn, was a prominent banker and philanthropist, who was a patron of the arts. Roger initially pursued a career in law but gave it up to pursue his love for music. He formed his first band, the Roger Wolfe Kahn Orchestra, in the late 1920s and became immensely popular in the New York City music scene. </p><p>Kahn was known for incorporating both jazz and classical elements into his music, and his band was credited with popularizing the foxtrot dance. His band's most popular hit was "Crazy Rhythm" which was released in 1928. The song became an instant classic and was covered numerous times by other musicians. </p><p>Kahn's career as a bandleader was cut short due to the Great Depression, which caused many orchestras to disband. He then turned to composing music for films and worked on the score for a number of Hollywood movies. Eventually, Kahn returned to New York and formed another orchestra, but this time, his popularity was not as high as it used to be. </p><p>Kahn continued to play music until his death from a heart attack in 1962. His legacy as one of the pioneering figures of early jazz and swing music endures to this day.</p><p>Throughout his career, Roger Wolfe Kahn composed and arranged music for a variety of other artists and bands, including Benny Goodman and Fletcher Henderson. He also worked on several Broadway productions, including "The Band Wagon" and "Flying Colors". On top of his significant contributions to the music world, Kahn was also an advocate for animal rights and even owned a pet lion named Cubs. In his later years, he became increasingly involved in the civil rights movement and was an avid supporter of Martin Luther King Jr. and his causes. Today, Kahn is remembered as a talented musician and composer who left an indelible mark on the development of modern jazz and popular music.</p><p></p><p>
