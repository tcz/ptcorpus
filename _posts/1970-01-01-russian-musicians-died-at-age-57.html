a Russian
writer, screenwriter and actor.


					</p><p>Brik was a prominent figure in the early 20th century Russian literary scene and was known for his contributions to the Russian avant-garde movement. He was a collaborator and close friend of the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky and was a founding member of the LEF group, a literary and artistic organization that championed the principles of Constructivism.</p><p>Brik's writing was highly experimental and he experimented with various forms and styles, including poetry, prose, and drama. He also worked as a screenwriter and actor in the Soviet film industry, and his films were noted for their innovative cinematography and editing.</p><p>Brik was married to Lili Brik, who was also a writer and an important figure in the Russian avant-garde. The couple was known for their unconventional lifestyle and their circle of friends included many of the most prominent artists and writers of the time.</p><p>During World War II, Brik continued to work as a writer and journalist, but his health began to deteriorate due to the difficult conditions in Moscow during the war. He died in 1945 at the age of 57.</p><p>Brik’s literary career began with the publication of his first book of poetry, entitled “The First Ice,” in 1908. He went on to publish several other collections of poetry throughout his life, including “The First Day” (1914) and “Mirrors” (1916). In addition to poetry, Brik also wrote articles and essays on literature, art, and culture for various magazines and newspapers in Russia.</p><p>Brik's friendship with Mayakovsky began in 1912 and the two went on to collaborate on several projects, including the play “Mystery-Bouffe” (1918), which was a satirical critique of the Russian Revolution.
