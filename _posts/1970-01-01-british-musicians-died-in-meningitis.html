film producer, promoter and writer.


					</p><p>He was an influential figure in the British music industry during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and is credited with discovering and promoting some of the era's biggest stars, including Tommy Steele, Marty Wilde, Billy Fury, and Duffy Power. Parnes was known for his flamboyant personality and extravagant promotional techniques, such as giving his artists colorful and attention-grabbing stage names. He also managed and produced several successful tours and shows, including the famous "Oh Boy!" television series. Despite his success, Parnes was also criticized for his controlling and exploitative treatment of his artists, particularly in regards to their financial and artistic freedoms.</p><p>Parnes was born in Willesden, London in 1930 to Jewish immigrants. He became involved in the music industry in the mid-1950s, initially as a songwriter and then as a manager and promoter. He quickly gained a reputation for his ability to spot and develop new talent, and his roster of artists soon became synonymous with the emerging rock and roll scene in Britain.</p><p>In addition to his work in the music industry, Parnes also dabbled in film production, with credits including the 1960 crime thriller "Too Hot to Handle" and the 1964 musical comedy "Just for You". He also wrote several books, including "The Secret Life of a Pop Manager" and "It's All Done with Mirrors".</p><p>Parnes passed away in 1989, but his legacy in the music industry lives on. Many of his protégés went on to have long and successful careers, and his influence on the early rock and roll scene in Britain cannot be overstated. Despite his controversial reputation, he will always be remembered as a larger-than-life figure who left an indelible mark on music history.</p><p>Parnes was known for his close relationships with his artists, often taking them under his wing and treating them like family. He was especially protective of his male artists, whom he often referred to as his "boys". This led to rumors and speculation about his sexuality, with some even suggesting that he was gay, although Parnes never publicly addressed the rumors.</p><p>In addition to his work with established artists, Parnes also held talent contests to discover new talent. One of his most successful finds was singer and actor David Essex, whom he managed early in his career.</p><p>Parnes' legacy has been both celebrated and criticized in the years since his death. While he is credited with helping to launch the careers of some of Britain's most iconic musicians, his treatment of his artists has been widely regarded as exploitative. In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny on his management practices, with some arguing that he took advantage of young and vulnerable artists who were eager for success. Despite this, his impact on the music industry during the 1950s and 1960s remains significant, and he will always be remembered as one of the key figures in the development of British rock and roll.</p><p>Parnes was known for his colorful and flamboyant personality, and was often seen wearing flashy outfits and driving luxury cars. He was also a shrewd businessman and was known for his negotiating skills. In addition to his work in music and film, he also owned several clothing stores and a record label.</p><p>Despite his reputation for being controlling, Parnes was deeply respected and admired by many of his artists. They credited him with helping to shape their careers and providing opportunities that they may not have otherwise had. In particular, Tommy Steele, one of Parnes' earliest discoveries, has spoken publicly about the impact that Parnes had on his life and career.</p><p>Parnes' influence on the music industry can still be felt today. His early promotion techniques, such as giving artists attention-grabbing stage names, have become commonplace in the industry. Additionally, his emphasis on visual presentation and showmanship helped pave the way for later acts, such as David Bowie and Queen, who were known for their theatrical performances.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his management practices, Parnes' impact on the British music industry cannot be denied. He helped launch the careers of some of the most iconic artists of the 20th century, and his legacy continues to be felt in the music of today.</p><p>Parnes was also known for his close relationship with Elvis Presley, whom he met in the late 1950s during Presley's tour of Europe. Parnes was one of the few people who Presley allowed to call him by his first name, and they remained friends until Presley's death in 1977. Parnes was instrumental in bringing Presley's music to a wider audience in the UK, and he organized several of Presley's tours and TV appearances in the country.</p><p>Despite his success in the music industry, Parnes faced financial difficulties later in life. He was forced to sell his record label and clothing stores, and he struggled to keep up with the changing music industry. Nevertheless, he remained a highly respected figure in the industry, and he continued to be involved in music until his death.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to the music industry, Parnes was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. Today, he is remembered as one of the pioneers of British rock and roll, and his impact on the music industry continues to be felt.</p><p></p><p>
