Despite his relatively short career, he was a significant figure in the art world of his time and inspired many later artists. He died at the age of 43 due to tuberculosis.</p><p>Dubois-Pillet was greatly influenced by the work of Georges Seurat and played an important role in the development of the Pointillist style.

His later works reveal a greater interest in the use of color and texture, reflecting his growing fascination with the decorative arts.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to art and politics, Dubois-Pillet was also a devoted family man. He was married to Marie Adèle Baubry and had three children. His son, Lucien, also became a painter and was influenced by his father's Pointillist style.</p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Dubois-Pillet's legacy as an artist and thinker has endured.
