(April 5, 2015		Lithuania-April 5, 1987)


was
a Lithuanian
personality.


					</p><p>George Cherepov was a prominent Lithuanian-American physicist and mathematician, known for his pioneering work in the field of fluid dynamics. Born in Lithuania in 1905, Cherepov immigrated to the United States in the 1920s to pursue higher education. He earned his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Physics from the University of Chicago, and went on to earn a PhD in Mathematics from Princeton University in 1933.</p><p>Cherepov's early work focused on the mathematical modeling of fluid flows and turbulence, which helped to advance the understanding of these phenomena in a broad range of applications, from airplane design to weather forecasting. His most significant contribution to the field was the Cherepov method, a numerical technique for solving complex equations of motion in fluid dynamics.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to science, Cherepov was a devoted teacher and mentor to many young physicists and mathematicians. He held positions at several universities throughout his career, including Yale University, the California Institute of Technology, and the University of Arizona.</p><p>Cherepov passed away in 1987, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking scientific research and a lasting impact on the fields of physics and mathematics.</p><p>Cherepov was considered an expert in his field and published numerous papers and articles throughout his career.

His groundbreaking research in the field of fluid dynamics, his passionate dedication to teaching and mentoring, and his tireless efforts to promote social justice and cultural heritage make him an enduring figure in the history of science and the Lithuanian American community.</p><p>Cherepov's life was not without challenges. As a Lithuanian immigrant in the United States during the early 20th century, he faced discrimination and prejudice. He also struggled with health issues, including a heart condition that limited his physical activity. Despite these obstacles, however, Cherepov remained focused on his work and dedicated himself to advancing the fields of physics and mathematics.</p><p>Cherepov was married to Taissa Cherepov, herself a prominent mathematician who worked alongside her husband at several institutions. Together, they raised four children.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and academic work, Cherepov was also an accomplished musician. He played the violin and piano, and was known for his love of chamber music. He often performed in small ensembles with fellow musicians, including his wife Taissa.</p><p>Cherepov's influence extended beyond his own lifetime, as his research and methods continue to be studied and applied in a variety of fields. His emphasis on numerical techniques and mathematical modeling revolutionized the way scientists approach problems in fluid dynamics, and his legacy continues to inspire the next generation of physicists and mathematicians.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions, Cherepov was posthumously inducted into the National Lithuanian American Hall of Fame in 2002. The honor acknowledges individuals who have made significant contributions to the Lithuanian American community and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>

(April 11, 1879		Lithuania-December 8, 1907			Zakopane)


was
a Lithuanian
writer.


					</p><p>Despite his short life, Biliūnas contributed significantly to Lithuanian literature. He is best known for his short stories and poetry, which often touched on themes of love, nature, and the struggles of the common people. Biliūnas was also a journalist and editor, working for various Lithuanian publications during his career. His writing style was simple yet powerful, and his works continue to be celebrated and studied in Lithuania today. In addition to his literary achievements, Biliūnas was also involved in the Lithuanian national movement, advocating for independence and cultural preservation during a time when Lithuania was under Russian control. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures in Lithuanian literature and culture.</p><p>Biliūnas was born into a noble family, but his father's reckless financial behavior caused the family to lose their financial stability. Despite this, Biliūnas was able to receive an education in Lithuania and later in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he studied law. However, his passion for writing led him to abandon his legal studies and pursue a career in literature.</p><p>Biliūnas's literary career began in 1901 when his first short story was published. He went on to publish several collections of short stories, including "Liūdna pasaka" and "Aitvarų šešėly", which continue to be popular today. Biliūnas's poetry, which was less known during his lifetime, has also gained recognition in recent years for its lyrical beauty and emotional depth.</p><p>Biliūnas's life was marked by his devotion to the Lithuanian cause. He was an active member of the Lithuanian national movement and used his writing to promote the country's cultural identity and independence. He also worked as an editor for several Lithuanian newspapers and was known for his incisive social commentary.</p><p>Despite his relatively short life, Biliūnas made a lasting impact on Lithuanian literature and culture. He remains a beloved figure in the country's artistic and literary communities, and his works continue to inspire new generations of writers and readers.</p><p>After Biliūnas's death, his legacy lived on through the publishing of his posthumous collections of short stories and poetry, including "Pavasario balsai" and "Jaunoji Lietuva". His influence extended beyond the world of literature, as he also inspired many young Lithuanians to take up the fight for independence during the country's struggle for sovereignty in the early 20th century.
