(September 19, 1844		Bogotá-July 17, 1911			Paris)


was
a Colombian
writer.


					</p><p>He was also a linguist, philologist, and a recognized authority on the Spanish language during his time. Cuervo was known for his extensive research and contributions to the study and preservation of the Spanish language, particularly in Colombia. He spent nearly thirty years of his life compiling and publishing his masterpiece, "Diccionario de construcción y régimen de la lengua castellana", which is considered as one of the most comprehensive Spanish-language dictionaries to date. Cuervo also wrote several essays and articles on Colombian history, literature, and language. His legacy continues to inspire and influence Spanish language scholars today.</p><p>Cuervo was born into a wealthy family in Bogotá, Colombia. He was fluent in French, Italian, and English, which helped him in his later studies of linguistics and philology. Cuervo studied in Europe and the United States, where he developed a keen interest in the Spanish language and its various dialects. He returned to Colombia in 1870 and began working on his seminal work, "Diccionario de construcción y régimen de la lengua castellana."</p><p>Cuervo's work was not without controversy, as some critics felt he was too prescriptive in his approach to the Spanish language. However, his contributions to the study of Spanish were widely recognized, and he became a respected authority on the language. Cuervo's "Diccionario" was published in two volumes, in 1895 and 1904, and became an indispensable reference for scholars of the Spanish language.</p><p>Cuervo was also interested in Colombian history and literature, and he wrote several articles and essays on these topics. He was a member of the Colombian Academy of Language and was elected to the Spanish Royal Academy. Sadly, Cuervo died before he could finish a third volume of his "Diccionario," but his contributions to the Spanish language continue to be celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>
