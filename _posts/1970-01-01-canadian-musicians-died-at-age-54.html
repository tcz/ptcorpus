(May 12, 1804		York, Upper Canada-December 9, 1858			Toronto)


was
a Canadian
lawyer.


					</p><p>He was also a politician who served as the first prime minister of the Province of Canada from 1848 to 1851, alongside his political partner Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine. Baldwin was known for his advocacy of responsible government, which aimed to give elected officials greater authority over government policy. He helped achieve important democratic reforms, such as the introduction of secret ballots for elections and the expansion of voting rights. Baldwin's efforts towards religious and social equality and the fight against institutional discrimination have earned him a place in Canadian history as a champion of human rights.</p><p>Baldwin was born into a prominent family, with his father being a lawyer and member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada. He followed in his father's footsteps and became a lawyer in 1825, quickly gaining a reputation for his legal expertise. </p><p>In 1836, Baldwin was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada as a Reform politician, advocating for responsible government and fighting against the Family Compact, a group of powerful elites who held significant influence over government decisions. Baldwin formed a close partnership with Lafontaine, a French-Canadian politician, and together they worked towards achieving their shared goals of democratic reform and equality. </p><p>Baldwin's political career was not without its challenges, including a failed attempt to form a government in 1842 and facing backlash from conservative opponents who opposed his progressive ideas. However, he persevered and his efforts to promote responsible government eventually paid off when he and Lafontaine were appointed co-premiers of the Province of Canada in 1848. </p><p>During his time as premier, Baldwin introduced many key reforms that strengthened democracy in Canada, including the introduction of secret ballots in elections and expanding voting rights to more citizens. He also advocated for the separation of church and state and fought against institutional discrimination, promoting social and religious equality in the province. </p><p>Baldwin's legacy as a champion of human rights lives on today, and he is remembered as a key figure in Canadian history who helped lay the foundation for democracy and equality in the country.</p><p></p><p>

was
a Canadian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a painter, writer, and a leading member of the Automatiste movement in Quebec. Borduas studied art in Montreal and later in Paris, where he became influenced by the work of the Surrealist and Abstract Expressionist painters. In 1948, he co-signed the manifesto Refus Global (Total Refusal) which criticized the conservative religious and political institutions of Quebec and called for a radical change in culture and society. This manifesto became a cultural touchstone and has been credited with inspiring the Quiet Revolution, a period of rapid modernization in Quebec. Borduas’ own work was known for its bold, gestural brushstrokes and its pioneering approach to abstraction. He died in a car accident in Paris at the age of 54. Today, Borduas is widely celebrated as a leading figure in Canadian modern art who challenged prevailing artistic conventions and helped shape the cultural identity of Quebec.</p><p>Borduas was born in a large family of 11 children and left school at the age of 14 to work and support his family. Despite his lack of formal education, he was determined to pursue art and began painting on his own. He eventually studied at the École du meuble in Montreal and later at the École des beaux-arts in Paris, where he was exposed to the avant-garde art movements of the time. </p><p>After returning to Quebec in 1930, Borduas worked as an art teacher and continued to develop his painting style. He produced a number of notable works, including "Big Nude" and "Earth Rotates," which were characterized by their dynamic, spontaneous brushstrokes and abstract forms. </p><p>Borduas played a key role in shaping the Automatiste movement in Quebec, which was characterized by its rejection of traditional artistic techniques and its embrace of spontaneity and individual expression. He was a member of the group that published Refus Global and participated in exhibitions that showcased Automatiste art. </p><p>Despite being controversial in his lifetime, Borduas is now widely recognized as an important figure in Canadian art history. His legacy has been celebrated in exhibitions and publications, and his work is held in collections around the world. His contribution to the development of modern art and his role in Quebec's cultural evolution have earned him a place in Canadian cultural history.</p><p></p><p>

In 1891, he was accused of corruption by his opponents and was forced to resign as Premier. He vigorously denied the allegations and ultimately won a landmark defamation trial against his accusers. The trial, which became known as the "Mercier Pardon," was a major factor in his posthumous reputation as a champion of justice and defender of the marginalized. </p><p>Despite his early advocacy for rights and autonomy for the Catholic Church in Quebec, Mercier eventually became a proponent of secularism and separation of church and state. This position was unpopular with some of his constituents, particularly among the Catholic clergy, but he believed it was essential for promoting democracy and individual freedoms. </p><p>Mercier's legacy continues to be celebrated in Quebec, where he is remembered as a key figure in the province's history and a symbol of francophone pride and resilience.</p><p></p><p>
