						</p><p>Hitler is most famously known for his leadership of the Nazi Party in Germany during World War II, during which he committed numerous war crimes and atrocities. He rose to power as Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and quickly consolidated control, centralizing power in himself and his Nazi followers. Hitler's ideology of Aryan supremacy, anti-Semitism, and totalitarianism resulted in the deaths of millions of people, including six million Jews in the Holocaust. Hitler's aggressive territorial expansion and military campaigns led to the deaths of tens of millions of people in World War II, and he ultimately committed suicide in his bunker in Berlin as Allied forces closed in. Hitler's legacy remains one of infamy and horror, and serves as a warning about the dangers of authoritarianism and intolerance.</p><p>Hitler's rise to power began in the aftermath of World War I, when Germany was suffering economic and political turmoil. He joined the German Workers' Party, which later became the Nazi Party, and quickly ascended to leadership positions within the organization. Using propaganda and his ability to appeal to the fears and prejudices of the German people, Hitler gained support and was eventually appointed Chancellor.</p><p>Once in power, Hitler began a systematic process of persecution and discrimination against non-Aryans, particularly Jews. The Nuremberg Laws, passed in 1935, stripped Jews of their citizenship and other basic rights, paving the way for the Holocaust. Hitler's military campaigns, including the invasion of Poland in 1939, led to the beginning of World War II.</p><p>Hitler's personal life was marked by instability and controversy. He was never married, but had a long-term relationship with Eva Braun, whom he married shortly before their joint suicide in 1945. Hitler was also known for his artistic and literary ambitions, but his works were largely rejected by the art world.</p><p>Despite his brutality and aggression, Hitler remains a subject of fascination and study for historians and scholars. His legacy serves as a reminder of the dangers of extremist ideologies and totalitarianism, and continues to shape conversations about power, freedom, and human rights.</p><p></p><p>

(March 9, 1892		Vienna-April 8, 1945			Kirchstetten)

	
		a.k.a. Weinheber, Josef

	
was
an Austrian
writer.


					</p><p>He began his career as a lyric poet, becoming known for his classical style and his love for the Austrian countryside. Despite his early success, Weinheber struggled with personal demons and political pressure, ultimately leading him to align with the Nazi party.</p><p>During WWII, Weinheber worked as a censor and propagandist for the regime, though towards the end of the war he began to experience disillusionment with his beliefs. Sadly, he was unable to escape the consequences of his actions; he committed suicide in 1945, just before the end of the war. </p><p>Today, Weinheber is considered a controversial figure in Austrian literature and his legacy continues to inspire debate and discussion.</p><p>Weinheber's literary output was extensive and diverse. He authored numerous collections of poetry, including "Adel und Untergang" (Nobility and Decline) and "Wien wörtlich" (Vienna Literally), as well as a number of plays and novels. In addition to his writing, Weinheber was also known for his translations of works by Shakespeare, Dante, and other prominent writers. Despite his controversial politics, many continue to admire Weinheber's work for its lyricism and its evocation of the natural beauty of Austria. However, his association with the Nazi party and his propagandistic writings continue to cast a shadow over his legacy.</p><p></p><p>
