In 1938, seeming to succumb to the pain and inability to continue writing due to her illness, she waded out into the sea in Mar del Plata and drowned herself. Her final poem, “Voy a dormir” ("I Am Going to Sleep"), in which she expresses a desire for rest and peace, is considered a haunting farewell to her readers and fans. Storni's death shocked and saddened the literary world, but her legacy has lived on through the continued study and celebration of her work. In recognition of her contributions to Argentine literature, a cultural center in Mar del Plata was named after her, and her image has appeared on Argentine postage stamps.</p><p>Despite the tragic end to her life, Alfonsina Storni's legacy has endured and continued to inspire many generations of writers, particularly women writers across Latin America. Her depictions of the female experience and her unwavering dedication to feminist ideals have made her an icon of resistance against sexism and oppression. Storni's works have been translated into several languages and continue to be studied and celebrated around the world. Through her writing and activism, she opened doors for other women in literature and helped pave the way for greater gender equality in society.</p><p>Since her death, Alfonsina Storni's works have been celebrated and studied around the world. Her legacy as a feminist icon has been championed by subsequent generations of women writers in Latin America and beyond. In addition to her literary influence, Storni's life and struggles continue to resonate with readers and activists who fight for gender equality and social justice. Her determination to speak out about issues affecting women, despite facing discrimination and backlash, remains a source of inspiration for many.

(April 5, 1788		La Rioja Province, Argentina-February 16, 1835			Barranca Yaco)


was
an Argentine
politician.


					</p><p>Quiroga was a prominent figure during Argentina's early independence struggles in the early 19th century. He fought in the wars against Spain and served as governor of La Rioja Province on several occasions. He was known for his fierce and often violent political style, earning him the nickname "the Tiger of the Plains."</p><p>Despite his controversial methods, Quiroga was widely respected by many in Argentina and was seen as a champion of the common people. He advocated for land reform and worked to improve conditions for farmers and workers.</p><p>Quiroga's life was cut short when he was assassinated in 1835, allegedly by political enemies. His death was mourned by many in Argentina, and he remains a figure of great importance in the country's history.</p><p>Quiroga was born to a wealthy family, but he grew up in poverty after his father died when he was young. As a result, he became deeply involved in politics and the military at a young age, and quickly rose to prominence due to his skill and bravery on the battlefield. Quiroga was known for his fierce loyalty to his allies and his unforgiving attitude towards his enemies, and he was instrumental in helping to shape the political landscape of Argentina during his lifetime.</p><p>Throughout his career, Quiroga became a major advocate for federalism and decentralization. He believed that the different regions of Argentina should have greater autonomy to govern themselves, and he worked tirelessly to promote this cause. Quiroga also believed that the government should play a more active role in promoting economic development and improving the lives of ordinary citizens.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Quiroga's legacy is somewhat controversial due to his violent methods and his failure to achieve many of his key goals. Nevertheless, he remains an important figure in Argentine history and an inspiration to many who share his commitment to social justice and political change.</p><p>Quiroga's political career began in the early 19th century, when he joined the army of the United Provinces of Río de la Plata in their struggle for independence from Spain. He quickly made a name for himself as a skilled military strategist and a fearless fighter. In 1815, Quiroga was named commander of the cavalry in the Army of the Andes, which was led by General José de San Martín. Together, they fought in several key battles during the wars of independence, including the decisive Battle of Maipú in 1818.</p><p>After the war, Quiroga returned to La Rioja and became involved in local politics. He served as governor of the province on several occasions, and he was also elected to the national congress in 1826. During this time, Quiroga became known for his controversial political tactics, which included violence, intimidation, and even assassinations of his political enemies.</p><p>Despite his reputation as a ruthless politician, Quiroga was also a champion of the common people.

His death was widely mourned in Argentina, and he is still remembered as a hero by many in his home province of La Rioja. Today, he is regarded as one of the most important and controversial figures in Argentine history.</p><p>In addition to his political and military endeavors, Facundo Quiroga was also a fervent supporter of indigenous rights. He believed that the indigenous peoples of Argentina were entitled to the same rights and protections as the Spanish-descended population, and he worked to promote their welfare and defend their land from outside encroachment. Quiroga's advocacy for indigenous rights was highly unusual for his time, and it made him a controversial figure among some of the more conservative elements of Argentine society.</p><p>Quiroga was also a prolific writer and thinker, and he produced a number of influential essays and political treatises. His most famous work is the Facundo, a biographical study of the caudillo Juan Facundo Quiroga (no relation), which is now regarded as an important work of Argentine literature. The Facundo explored the turbulent political and social landscape of 19th century Argentina, and it provided a sharp critique of the region's oligarchical power structures. Quiroga's book is now considered a classic of Latin American literature and is widely taught in universities throughout the region.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Facundo Quiroga remains a complex and controversial figure. Some admire him as a courageous champion of the common people, while others criticize him for his violent political tactics and his inability to achieve many of his key goals. Nevertheless, his legacy as a pioneering advocate for indigenous rights, a promoter of land reform, and a committed fighter for social justice continues to inspire many in Argentina and beyond.</p><p>In addition to his military and political careers, Facundo Quiroga had a passionate love for horses and horse racing. He was known for his exceptional horsemanship and often participated in races himself. Quiroga even owned several horses that were regarded as some of the best in Argentina at the time. He also supported the development of horse breeding in the country, which eventually became an important industry in Argentina. Quiroga's love for horses and racing was reflected in his political career as well, as he often used equestrian symbolism and metaphors in his speeches and political campaigns.</p><p>Another important aspect of Quiroga's legacy is his influence on Argentine literature. Several prominent writers, such as Jorge Luis Borges and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, were both influenced by and critical of Quiroga's legacy. Borges in particular was fascinated with Quiroga's violent and controversial persona, which he explored in his short story "The South." Quiroga's impact on Argentine literature and culture endures to this day, as he remains a prominent figure in the country's artistic imagination.</p><p>Lastly, Quiroga's death has remained shrouded in mystery and controversy to this day. While it is widely believed that he was assassinated by his political opponents, the exact circumstances surrounding his death remain unclear. Some theories suggest that he was killed in a conspiracy involving several powerful politicians and military figures of the time. Despite several investigations over the years, the identity of the killers and the motives behind the assassination have yet to be definitively established.</p><p>Quiroga's legacy as a political and social reformer has had a lasting impact on Argentina. He is remembered as a trailblazer for his advocacy for indigenous rights and his commitment to land reform and economic development. Quiroga's controversial tactics and methods have drawn criticism, yet his contributions to the country's political and cultural history remain significant.
