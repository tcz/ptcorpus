Jelínková also wrote several books, including a collection of short stories and a memoir of her experiences as an actress. Outside of her artistic pursuits, Jelínková was also a dedicated member of the resistance during World War II, participating in anti-Nazi activities and providing assistance to those in need. Despite her many accomplishments, Jelínková spent her final years in relative obscurity, living alone in a small apartment in Prague until her death in 1988. Today, she is remembered as one of the most talented and influential performers in the history of Czech cinema.</p><p>Despite Jelínková's achievements and talent, she faced personal struggles throughout her life. She was married twice, both marriages ending in divorce. She also had financial difficulties in her later years, which led her to sell some of her paintings to make ends meet.

Her father was a railway worker and her mother was a homemaker. Jelínková showed an early interest in the arts, particularly acting, and began performing in local theaters as a teenager. In 1926, she moved to Prague to pursue a career in acting and enrolled at the Prague Conservatory. </p><p>Jelínková's early theater work was focused on the avant-garde style of the time, and she quickly gained a reputation as a talented and versatile performer. She appeared in productions across Czechoslovakia, including in the National Theatre in Prague. As she transitioned to film in the 1930s, Jelínková continued to pursue theater work, performing in productions of both classic plays and contemporary works.</p><p>During World War II, Jelínková became involved in the resistance movement against the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. She provided assistance to those in need, including food and shelter for Jews and other refugees. Following the end of the war, Jelínková continued her acting career and became increasingly involved in painting and writing.</p><p>Jelínková's distinctive voice was one of her most recognizable features, and she lent her talents to several radio programs and animated films. Her work as the Czech voice of Snow White in the Disney film was particularly memorable, and she became a household name in the country.</p><p>Despite her many accomplishments, Jelínková remained humble and dedicated to her craft throughout her life. She rarely gave interviews and preferred to let her work speak for itself. Today, she is remembered as a true artist, who used her talents to entertain, inspire and uplift audiences throughout the Czech Republic and beyond.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/czechoslovakian-actresses-died-in-1968.html' title='Czechoslovakian actresses died in 1968'><strong>Czechoslovakian actresses died in 1968</strong> List of the top 1 Czechoslovakian actresses who died in 1968</a></li><li><a href='/west-german-actors-died-in-liver-cancer.html' title='West German actors died in Liver cancer'><strong>West German actors died in Liver cancer</strong> List of the top 1 West German actors who died in Liver cancer</a></li><li><a href='/turkish-actors-died-at-age-72.html' title='Turkish actors died at age 72'><strong>Turkish actors died at age 72</strong> List of the top 1 Turkish actors who died when they were 72</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/italian-musicians-died-at-age-57.html' title='Italian musicians died at age 57'><strong>Italian musicians died at age 57</strong> List of the top 10 Italian music stars who died when they were 57</a></li><li><a href='/lithuanian-actresses-died-in-1988.html' title='Lithuanian actresses died in 1988'><strong>Lithuanian actresses died in 1988</strong> List of the top 1 Lithuanian actresses who died in 1988</a></li><li><a href='/chinese-actresses-died-in-drug-overdose.html' title='Chinese actresses died in Drug overdose'><strong>Chinese actresses died in Drug overdose</strong> List of the top 1 Chinese actresses who died in Drug overdose</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
