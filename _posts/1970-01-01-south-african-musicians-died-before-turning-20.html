playwright.


					</p><p>Kente is known to be the father of black theatre in South Africa and was well-regarded for his contributions to the development of theatre in the country during the apartheid era. He wrote and directed several plays that explored the lives of black South Africans, their struggles with poverty, racism, and oppression. His works were often performed in townships and were aimed at inspiring and empowering black South Africans. Kente was also a pioneer in creating plays that featured all-black casts and crews, providing opportunities for black actors, writers, and directors to showcase their talents. Despite facing censorship and repression from the apartheid government, Kente continued to produce groundbreaking plays that challenged social norms and gave voice to the black community.</p><p>Some of Kente's most popular productions included "Sekunjalo!", "How Long?", and "Too Late". "Sekunjalo!" was particularly well-received and went on to be performed in London's West End. Kente also founded the Serpent Players, a theatre group that paved the way for black South Africans to find work in the arts during apartheid. Throughout his career, Kente used theatre as a means of resistance and change, using his platform to highlight the injustices and struggles of the black community. He paved the way for future generations of black South African artists, making his mark as an influential figure in the country's cultural history.</p><p>Gibson Kente was born on April 23, 1932, in Eastern Cape, South Africa, and grew up in a family of entertainers. His father was a prolific musician, while his mother was a traditional healer and sangoma. As a child, Kente was exposed to the arts from an early age and developed a love for theatre. After completing his education, he moved to Johannesburg, where he worked as a journalist before turning his attention to theatre.</p><p>Kente's early works were often light-hearted and comedic but took a more serious tone as he became more politically aware. He began to write plays that tackled apartheid head-on, delving into the social issues affecting black South Africans. Kente's works were groundbreaking in their use of African language, music, and dance, which helped to create a unique and authentic voice for black South Africans.</p><p>Despite being considered one of the most important figures in South African theatre, Kente struggled to find consistent financial support for his productions. His plays were often self-financed, and he relied on the support of his community and the Serpent Players to make his vision a reality. Despite this, his contributions to theatre in South Africa cannot be overlooked, as he paved the way for black artists to create work that was authentic and meaningful.</p><p>Kente's legacy continues to influence South African theatre and culture, with many calling for greater recognition of his contributions to the arts. Several of his plays have been revived and performed across the country, reaching new audiences and inspiring a new generation of theatre artists. Kente's commitment to telling stories that reflected the experiences of black South Africans and his pioneering work in creating a space for black artists within the theatre industry will always be remembered as a vital part of the country's artistic heritage.</p><p></p><p>
