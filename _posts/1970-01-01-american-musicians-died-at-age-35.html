In 1966, he flew an F-104 Starfighter to an altitude of 27,000 meters, setting a new world record for altitude in an aircraft. The following year, he became the first human being to witness a launch from space, as he observed a Soviet rocket launch while aboard a U.S. Navy aircraft.</p><p>After Williams' death, his wife, the former Janet Lee Phillips, became a strong advocate for space exploration and education. She established the Clifton C.

Following his graduation in 1954, Williams enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and began his military service as a pilot.</p><p>During his time fighting in the Korean War, Williams flew various missions, including nighttime fighter-bomber sorties. In addition to his time in the military, Williams continued his education and earned a Master of Science degree in International Affairs from George Washington University in 1964.</p><p>Williams' legacy continues to be celebrated by the NASA community. In 2011, astronaut Mark Kelly named his pet rescue dog "Gabby" after Williams' wife, Janet Lee Williams, who served as a godmother to the spaceship Endeavour. The spaceship carried a toy version of Gabby during its final mission. Furthermore, William's military legacy continues through his son, Clifton Williams III, who is a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot.</p><p></p><p>
