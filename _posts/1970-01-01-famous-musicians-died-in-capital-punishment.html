(April 24, 1906		Brooklyn-January 3, 1946			HM Prison Wandsworth)

	
		a.k.a. Lord Haw Haw or Joyce, William

	
was
a British
politician.


					</p><p>Actually, William Joyce was not a British politician. He was an American-born fascist and Nazi propaganda broadcaster during World War II. Joyce was a member of the British Union of Fascists before fleeing to Germany when war broke out. He later became a naturalized German citizen and began broadcasting propaganda aimed at demoralizing British troops and citizens. His broadcasts earned him the nickname "Lord Haw Haw." Joyce was captured by British authorities in May 1945 and executed for treason in January 1946.</p><p>Joyce's broadcasts were infamous for their exaggerations and claims of British defeat, as well as his distinctive voice and British accent. He was also known for spreading anti-Semitic and xenophobic rhetoric. After his capture, Joyce was put on trial for treason, despite being an American citizen. His defense that he had never formally renounced his US citizenship was not accepted, and he was found guilty and executed. Joyce's legacy was one of betrayal and collaboration with the enemy, and his name became a byword for treason in the UK.</p><p>Joyce's story is particularly interesting because of his background - he was actually born in Brooklyn, New York to Irish Catholic parents. His family moved to Ireland when he was young, and he later attended college in England. It was there that he became involved in far-right politics, joining the British Union of Fascists and rising through its ranks. When war broke out, Joyce fled to Germany with the help of Nazi sympathizers and began broadcasting propaganda aimed at British listeners.</p><p>Despite his American citizenship, Joyce became one of the most notorious figures in the Nazi propaganda machine. He was known for his bombastic style and his willingness to make outrageous claims in his broadcasts. He also frequently used his British accent to try to convince listeners that he was someone with inside knowledge of the situation in Britain.</p><p>After the war, Joyce was captured by British forces and put on trial for treason. The trial was controversial, as some argued that Joyce's American citizenship should have protected him from prosecution. Nevertheless, he was found guilty and executed in January 1946. Today, Joyce is remembered as a cautionary tale about the dangers of collaboration with fascist regimes and the corrosive effects of propaganda.</p><p>It's worth noting that Joyce's propaganda broadcasts were not limited to just Britain. He also targeted the United States and other Allied powers, trying to deepen divisions and spread disinformation. Joyce's broadcasts were a key part of the Nazi propaganda machine, which sought to undermine morale and sow confusion among enemy forces. </p><p>Furthermore, there is some speculation that Joyce may have had Jewish ancestry on his mother's side. This irony was not lost on his detractors, who viewed his rabid anti-Semitism as a desperate attempt to distance himself from his possible Jewish heritage. </p><p>Joyce's life and career have been the subject of numerous books, movies, and other media. While he remains a controversial figure, his story continues to fascinate those interested in the history of fascism, propaganda, and the Second World War.</p><p></p><p>
