									</h1><p>Here are 2 famous musicians from Afghanistan died at 68:</p><h2>Mohammed Daoud Khan</h2><p><strong>Mohammed Daoud Khan</strong>
(July 18, 1909		Kabul-April 28, 1978			Kabul)


was
an Afghan
politician.


					</p><p>Daoud Khan served as the Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1953 to 1963 and then as the President of Afghanistan from 1973 to 1978. He was a member of the royal family and a cousin of King Zahir Shah. Daoud Khan's government was known for its social and economic reforms and for improving the status of women in Afghanistan. He also sought to reduce Afghanistan's dependence on foreign aid and to strengthen the country's self-sufficiency. However, his regime was criticized for its authoritarianism and for suppressing political opposition. In 1978, Daoud Khan was overthrown and killed by members of the Afghan military and the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan in a bloody coup. This event marked the beginning of the Soviet-Afghan War and the subsequent instability that has plagued Afghanistan for decades.</p><p>Despite criticism of his authoritarianism, Daoud Khan had a deep commitment to Afghan independence and nationalism. He was instrumental in negotiating the Afghan-Soviet Friendship Treaty of 1978, which allowed for Soviet aid and assistance to Afghanistan, but also led to increased Soviet influence and meddling in Afghan affairs. He also sought to improve relations with neighboring countries such as Iran and Pakistan. </p><p>Daoud Khan's legacy is mixed, with some seeing him as a visionary leader who sought to modernize and improve Afghanistan, while others view him as a flawed ruler who made authoritarian decisions that ultimately led to his downfall. Regardless, his death marked a turning point in Afghan history and set the stage for the country's tumultuous political climate in the decades to come.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of assassination.

(August 23, 1865		Ghazni-November 22, 1933			Istanbul)


was
an Afghan
politician and journalist.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Soraya Tarzi.

						</p><p>Tarzi is considered a founder of Afghan journalism and one of the most prominent intellectuals in the country's history. He was a strong advocate for modernization and worked to promote education and civil liberties, particularly for women. He was also a vocal critic of the monarchy's authoritarian rule and helped to establish the first constitution of Afghanistan in 1923. In addition to his political activism, Tarzi was known for his literary contributions, particularly his poetry and essays on Afghan culture and society. He spent the later years of his life in exile, due to his opposition to the government, and died in Istanbul in 1933.</p><p>Tarzi was born into a distinguished family of scholars and leaders in Ghazni, Afghanistan. He received his early education in Kabul, before travelling to Turkey to continue his studies. During his time in Turkey, he was exposed to the ideas of the Young Turks movement and became fascinated by the concept of nationalism. </p><p>Upon his return to Afghanistan, Tarzi began working as a journalist and editor, and quickly became a prominent voice in the country's political discourse. He argued that Afghanistan needed to shed its traditionalist outlook and embrace modernity, both by adopting European-style governance and by investing in education and infrastructure. He also advocated for greater social freedoms for women, urging his fellow citizens to abandon the strict gender roles that were prevalent in Afghan society. </p><p>Despite facing opposition from both the monarchy and conservative factions within Afghan society, Tarzi remained steadfast in his beliefs. He played an integral role in the drafting of the 1923 constitution, which established Afghanistan as a constitutional monarchy and enshrined basic civil rights for citizens. </p><p>Tarzi's legacy as a visionary reformer has endured long after his death. He is remembered as one of Afghanistan's most influential thinkers and as a champion of progressive ideals. His daughter, Soraya Tarzi, would later become a prominent political figure in her own right and one of the country's foremost advocates for women's rights.</p><p></p><p>
