He later moved to the United States where he became a professor of the history of science at Harvard University. Sarton was a strong advocate for the importance of studying the history of science and believed that scientific progress was intimately connected to the cultural and historical context in which it was produced. He wrote several influential books on the history of science, including "Introduction to the History of Science" and "A History of Science". Sarton also co-founded the Isis journal, which remains a leading publication in the history of science field.</p><p>Additionally, Sarton was a polyglot and was proficient in several languages including French, German, Arabic, and Hebrew.

He founded the History of Science Society, a professional society that aims to promote the study of the history of science. Sarton's contribution to the field of history of science was immense and his work has received widespread recognition. The George Sarton Medal, awarded by the History of Science Society, is named in his honor and is given to individuals who have made significant contributions to the field.</p><p>Sarton was also known for his critical approach to the history of science, often focusing on the social and cultural factors that influenced scientific discoveries and breakthroughs. He argued that understanding the context in which scientific ideas arose was essential to fully appreciating their significance. Sarton was also a supporter of women in science and believed that their contributions to the field had been overlooked and undervalued. In addition to his scholarly work, Sarton was a poet and a literary critic. He published several volumes of poetry and wrote essays on the relationship between science and literature. Sarton continued to publish and teach until his death in 1956. His legacy continues to inspire scholars and students who believe in the importance of bridging the gap between science and the humanities.</p><p>Sarton's passion for the history of science was evident from a young age. At just 16 years old, he wrote a paper titled "The Periodic System of Mendeleev" which sparked his interest in the field. Throughout his career, he also emphasized the importance of the history of science in shaping scientific education.

After his death, Helen compiled a collection of his essays and published them in a book titled "A History of Science, Volume I: Ancient Science Through the Golden Age of Greece".</p><p>Sarton's legacy as a historian, poet, and humanist continues to inspire generations of scholars who are interested in the intersection of science, culture, and history. His emphasis on the importance of studying the social and cultural context of scientific discoveries is still relevant today and has contributed to a better understanding of the role of science in society.</p><p></p><p>

(June 22, 1863		Berlin-January 1, 1935			Potsdam)


was
a German
politician and diplomat.


					</p><p>He served as the Foreign Secretary of the German Empire from 1913 to 1916, during the critical period leading up to the First World War. Jagow was a career diplomat who was respected for his intelligence and competence. However, he is often criticized for his role in the diplomatic crisis that eventually led to the outbreak of war in 1914. Jagow was a strong advocate of Germany's alliance with Austria-Hungary and his diplomatic efforts were focused on maintaining this alliance. Despite his efforts, he was unable to prevent the escalation of tensions between Europe's major powers and the outbreak of war. After the war, Jagow was briefly imprisoned by the Allies for his role in the conflict but was eventually released.</p><p>Jagow began his career in the German Foreign Service in 1895 and quickly rose through the ranks due to his talent and hard work. Prior to becoming the Foreign Secretary, he served as Germany's ambassador to Rome, where his diplomatic skills helped to strengthen the relationship between Germany and Italy. </p><p>During his time as Foreign Secretary, Jagow faced many challenges, including the Balkan Wars and the growing conflict between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. He was part of the team that drafted the infamous "blank check" that Germany gave to Austria-Hungary, promising unconditional support in its conflict with Serbia. Jagow believed that a quick victory for Austria-Hungary would be in Germany's best interest, but he failed to anticipate Russia's involvement in the conflict. </p><p>After World War I, Jagow withdrew from politics and lived a quiet life in Potsdam until his death in 1935. Despite his controversial role in the events leading up to the war, he remained a respected figure in German diplomatic circles and was even praised by some for his efforts to prevent a larger conflict from breaking out.</p><p>Jagow was born into a family with a long history of serving in the Prussian and German governments, and his father was a high-ranking officer in the Prussian army. He was educated at the universities of Berlin and Bonn, where he studied law and political science. After graduating, he joined the German Foreign Service and was posted to various diplomatic missions around the world.</p><p>Jagow was known for his conservative political views and his support for the monarchy. He was also an ardent believer in Germany's imperial ambitions and saw the country's future as a dominant power in Europe. As Foreign Secretary, he was deeply involved in the arms race with Britain and worked to strengthen Germany's military and naval capabilities.</p><p>Despite his involvement in the events leading up to the war, Jagow was not a member of the inner circle of German decision-makers. He was often sidelined by more influential figures such as Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg and Army Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke. After the war, he was one of many Germans who struggled to come to terms with the country's defeat and the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles.</p><p>Jagow's legacy remains a topic of debate among historians. Some see him as a competent and loyal diplomat who was caught up in the complex political currents of his time. Others view him as a reckless and shortsighted figure who helped to bring about one of the deadliest conflicts in human history.</p><p>Jagow was married to Margarethe von Czettritz-Bülau, with whom he had two children. In addition to his diplomatic career, Jagow was also a published author, writing several books on politics and diplomacy. He was a member of the conservative German National People's Party and was involved in various cultural and charitable organizations throughout his life.</p><p>During his imprisonment after the war, Jagow wrote a memoir titled "Reflections on the World War," in which he defended his actions and portrayed himself as a victim of circumstance. However, the memoir was widely criticized for its self-justifying tone and its failure to take responsibility for the events that led to the war.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his role in the war, Jagow's legacy as a diplomat and statesman continues to be studied and debated. His career highlights the complex political currents and competing interests that existed in Europe in the years leading up to the First World War.</p><p></p><p>

Clay was known for his eloquent speeches and his skill in forging political alliances. He ran for president three times but was never successful. Despite that, he remains one of the most influential politicians of his era and was credited with helping to expand American democracy.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Green Clay was also a prominent plantation owner and slaveholder. He owned several plantations in Virginia and Kentucky, where he used enslaved labor to grow tobacco, hemp, and other crops. Despite his ownership of enslaved people, Clay was a founding member of the American Colonization Society, which aimed to encourage the resettlement of free African Americans to Africa. </p><p>Clay was also a devoted family man, and he and his wife Sally had eleven children together. Their son, Cassius Marcellus Clay, became a well-known abolitionist and political figure in his own right.</p><p>Green Clay passed away in 1828 and was buried in Lexington, Kentucky. Many cities and counties throughout the United States are named after him, including Clay County, Kentucky and Clay County, Missouri.</p><p>Green Clay was born into a wealthy planter family in Virginia. His father was a wealthy tobacco planter, and his mother was the daughter of a prominent Virginia planter. He received a good education in a local school and later attended the College of William and Mary, where he studied law.</p><p>Clay began his political career in Virginia, where he was elected to the House of Delegates. He soon became known as a skilled orator and a fierce defender of states' rights. In 1799, he was elected to serve in the Virginia Ratifying Convention, where he played a crucial role in securing Virginia's vote in favor of the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>After serving in the Virginia House of Delegates, Clay moved to Kentucky, where he continued his political career.

However, he also supported efforts to promote the colonization of free African Americans to Africa, seeing this as a way to address the problem of slavery without disrupting the economic and social order of the South.</p><p>Despite his mixed legacy, Green Clay remains a towering figure in American history. His tireless dedication to public service, his skill in navigating the complex political landscape of his day, and his commitment to expanding American democracy and securing Western expansion helped to pave the way for the continued growth and development of the United States.</p><p></p><p>

(December 4, 1777		Lyon-May 11, 1849			Paris)

	
		also known as Jeanne Francoise Julie Adelaide Recamier

	
was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>Juliette Récamier was considered one of the most beautiful and prominent women in the early 19th century. She was a socialite, salonnière, and writer who had close relationships with many prominent politicians, writers, and thinkers of her time, including François-René de Chateaubriand and Madame de Staël. Known for her sharp wit, intelligence, and charm, Récamier was a popular hostess of French salons, which were important venues for intellectual and political discourse during the era of Napoleon Bonaparte.</p><p>Born to a prosperous family in Lyon, France, Récamier was educated at the Convent of the Dames de la Visitation in Lyon. She married a wealthy banker, Jacques-Rose Récamier, when she was just 15 years old, and moved to Paris, where she soon established herself as a leading figure in high society. She hosted her first salon at the age of 18, and her gatherings quickly became popular among Parisian elites, who hoped to be included in her exclusive guest list.</p><p>Despite her fame and popularity, Récamier lived a relatively private life. She maintained close relationships with many influential figures, including Napoleon Bonaparte, who once offered her a position at the French court (which she declined). She was also known for her devotion to religion, often donating money to charitable causes and founding a religious order for women.</p><p>Today, Juliette Récamier is remembered as a symbol of French elegance and sophistication, and her name continues to be associated with the glamorous social circles of 19th-century Paris.</p><p>In addition to her social and religious involvement, Juliette Récamier was also a writer.

She was also known for her love of fashion, and her signature hairstyle, a simple yet elegant chignon, became widely popular among women of the era.</p><p>Despite her close relationships with many men, including Chateaubriand, Récamier's marriage to Jacques-Rose Récamier was reportedly platonic. They lived separately for much of their married life, and he even went bankrupt at one point, forcing her to sell their home and jewelry to cover his debts.</p><p>After her death, Récamier's legacy continued to inspire writers, artists, and fashion designers. Her salon was recreated in paintings and literature, and her fashion sense was celebrated in magazines and fashion shows. Today, she remains an iconic figure of French cultural history.</p><p>Despite her own wealth and prestige, Juliette Récamier was known for her charitable works and often donated large sums of money to those in need. She founded a religious order of women, the Abbaye-aux-Bois, which she financed with her personal fortune.
