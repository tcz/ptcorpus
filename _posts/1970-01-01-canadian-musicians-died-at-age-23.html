Peter Dmytruk is remembered as a national hero in Canada and his legacy has been celebrated through various memorials and exhibits, as well as in the 1997 book "Ortona: Canada's Epic World War II Battle" by Mark Zuehlke.</p><p>Dmytruk was born in Bolshev, Ukraine and immigrated with his family to Canada at the age of six. He grew up in Alberta and joined the Canadian Army in 1940, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. Dmytruk quickly rose through the ranks to become a corporal.</p><p>During the Battle of Ortona, Dmytruk was part of a mission to clear out German soldiers from a heavily fortified building. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Dmytruk led his squad in a fearless charge and successfully cleared the building of all enemy fighters. However, while exiting the building, Dmytruk was shot and fatally wounded by a German sniper.</p><p>Dmytruk's heroism and sacrifice inspired a generation of Canadians and his name lives on through several memorials, including the Peter Dmytruk Memorial Park in Edmonton and a plaque at the Canadian War Museum. In addition, the Loyal Edmonton Regiment Military Museum houses a collection of Dmytruk's personal effects, including his medals and photographs.</p><p>Dmytruk's legacy also lives on through his family. His sister, Mary Cherneski, has been a staunch advocate for veterans and their families, and she was instrumental in establishing the Peter Dmytruk Scholarship Fund. This fund provides financial assistance to descendants of Canadian combat veterans who are pursuing a post-secondary education. Dmytruk's niece, Sandy Balascak, has also worked tirelessly to preserve his memory and ensure that his heroism is never forgotten. In 2016, Balascak published a book entitled "A Corporal's Story: Experiences in the Ranks of Company C, 1st Battalion, Loyal Edmonton Regiment, During the Italian Campaign, 1943-1944, as Told by Peter Dmytruk," which includes excerpts from letters and journals written by Dmytruk during his time in the army. His story continues to be told and inspires people around the world to honor and remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.</p><p>Peter Dmytruk's heroism and dedication to duty did not go unnoticed during his lifetime, as he was awarded several medals and honors for his bravery. He was awarded the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal, the 1939-45 Star, the Italy Star, and the War Medal. In addition, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his exceptional valor during the Battle of Ortona. </p><p>Dmytruk's sacrifice and the sacrifices of countless other soldiers during World War II ultimately led to the defeat of Nazi Germany and the axis powers, ensuring the survival of democracy and freedom across the world. His legacy has inspired generations of Canadians to honor the sacrifices of their soldiers and to continue to uphold the values of peace, freedom, and justice.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1881-July 22, 1904)


was
a Canadian
personality.


					</p><p>He was best known for his involvement in a high-profile murder case in New York City, where he was accused of killing a millionaire textile merchant. Despite proclaiming his innocence and the lack of concrete evidence against him, George was found guilty and sentenced to death by electrocution. His trial and execution drew widespread attention and controversy, with many calling for a re-examination of the evidence and a more humane method of execution. Despite this, George was ultimately put to death and his case remains a subject of fascination for true crime enthusiasts to this day.</p><p>George Gee was born in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada. He came from a poor family and was known for his striking appearance and charming personality. He moved to the United States and took odd jobs to support himself. </p><p>In 1904, at the age of 23, he was arrested for the murder of David H. Dunkle, a wealthy New York City textile merchant. George had been seen in Dunkle's company the night of the murder, but no direct evidence linked him to the crime. The prosecution built its case on circumstantial evidence, and experts at the time disagreed on the veracity of the evidence.</p><p>Despite protests from supporters who believed in his innocence, George was found guilty and sentenced to death by electrocution. His lawyers made several appeals, but all were denied. George was executed on July 22, 1904, at Sing Sing prison.</p><p>After George's death, his case continued to attract attention and scrutiny. Some believed he was innocent and had been wrongly convicted, citing inconsistencies in the evidence presented at trial. Others believed he was guilty and had simply gotten away with murder. His case has been the subject of books, articles, and even a play, and it remains a topic of debate among true crime enthusiasts.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his conviction and execution, little is known about George's life before his involvement in the murder case. It is unclear why he moved to the United States or how he met David Dunkle, the victim in the case. His family in Canada reportedly disowned him after his arrest, and it is not known if he had any other close relationships in his life. Nonetheless, his case remains a tragic example of the flaws of the criminal justice system and the complex relationship between justice and truth.</p><p>Some have speculated about George's motives for the murder, suggesting that he may have been involved in a romantic relationship with Dunkle's daughter or that he had been hired to carry out the murder by a rival businessman. However, these theories remain unproven and are largely based on conjecture.</p><p>In the years following George's execution, several of his personal belongings were put up for auction, including his pocket watch and a lock of his hair. These items have become collector's items among true crime enthusiasts and are highly sought after by those interested in George's case.</p><p>Despite the passage of time, the case of George Gee remains a controversial and fascinating topic in the history of true crime. It serves as a reminder of the complexities of the criminal justice system and the importance of ensuring that all evidence is thoroughly examined before issuing a verdict.</p><p></p><p>
