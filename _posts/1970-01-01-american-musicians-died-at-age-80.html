He often spoke out against the "Gag Rule" which prevented anti-slavery petitions from being discussed in Congress. </p><p>In addition to his political and diplomatic career, John Quincy Adams had a keen interest in the arts and sciences. He was a member of several scientific societies and helped establish the Smithsonian Institution. Adams also had a passion for the outdoors and enjoyed hiking, horseback riding, and swimming. He was the first president to regularly swim in the Potomac River.</p><p>Despite being an accomplished politician and diplomat, John Quincy Adams struggled with depression throughout his life. He once wrote in his diary, “My whole life has been a succession of disappointments. I can scarcely recollect a single instance of success in anything that I ever undertook.” Nevertheless, his dedication to public service and his unwavering commitment to the principles of liberty and justice continue to inspire Americans to this day.</p><p></p><p>

Prior to his invention, news and information could only travel as fast as a human on horseback or by ship.</p><p>In addition to his work as an inventor, Morse was also a talented artist and painter. He studied art in Europe, particularly in Paris, where he was influenced by the works of renowned artists such as Jacques-Louis David. His painting entitled "Gallery of the Louvre" gained him fame as an artist.</p><p>Morse was a staunch supporter of the Union during the American Civil War and was a vocal opponent of slavery. He served as the President of the National Academy of Design from 1826 to 1845 and was a founding member of the University of the City of New York (now New York University).</p><p>Overall, Samuel Morse was a polymath who left a lasting impact on the worlds of communication and art.</p><p>Morse was born into a prominent family: his father was a Calvinist pastor and his mother was the daughter of a distinguished Revolutionary War veteran. He was the eldest of eleven children and showed a keen interest in science and art from a young age.</p><p>After receiving a formal education at Yale University, Morse pursued his interest in art and moved to London to study under the American painter Benjamin West. He later traveled to Paris, where he met renowned artists such as Ingres and Delacroix, and continued his training under the tutelage of Jacques-Louis David.</p><p>Morse's interest in science and invention was piqued during his voyage back to the United States in 1832. He overheard a conversation about electromagnetism on board the ship and began to experiment with the concept upon his return to New York.</p><p>After years of trial and error, Morse successfully demonstrated his telegraph system in 1844, transmitting the famous message "What hath God wrought!" from Washington D.C. to Baltimore. The system allowed for near-instantaneous communication across great distances, revolutionizing the way people thought about information and paving the way for future advancements in communication technology.</p><p>Morse's legacy as an inventor and artist continues to be celebrated to this day. His contributions to the fields of communication and art have left a lasting impact on American society and the world at large.</p><p></p><p>

(December 5, 1905		Vyzhnytsia-April 23, 1986			New York City)

	
		also known as Otto Ludwig Preminger or Otto the Ogre

	
was
an American
film director, actor, film producer and theatre director.


					
			
		He had
		three
		children,
		Erik Lee Preminger, Victoria Preminger and Mark Preminger.

						</p><p>Born in present-day Ukraine, Preminger immigrated to the United States in the early 1930s after fleeing Nazi persecution in Europe. He initially worked on Broadway as a theater director before transitioning to Hollywood as a film director in the 1940s. Preminger's career spanned over three decades, during which he directed classic films such as "Anatomy of a Murder," "Laura," and "Exodus."</p><p>In addition to his work as a director, Preminger also served as a producer on several of his own films, as well as on the Broadway productions of "The Moon is Blue" and "Porgy and Bess." He was known for his uncompromising and often controversial style, tackling taboo subjects such as drug addiction and homosexuality in his films at a time when such themes were still considered taboo by mainstream Hollywood.</p><p>Preminger received numerous accolades for his contributions to film and theater, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and nominations for multiple Academy Awards and Tony Awards. Despite his hard-nosed reputation, he was also known for mentoring and supporting young actors and directors, such as Clint Eastwood and William Friedkin.</p><p>Preminger was also an accomplished actor, having appeared in small roles in several films throughout his career. He was known for his distinctive voice and imposing physical presence, which lent itself well to villainous roles. Preminger's directorial style was characterized by his attention to detail and his willingness to challenge the status quo. This often placed him at odds with the conservative Hollywood establishment, but also earned him a devoted following among cinephiles and admirers of bold, provocative cinema. In later years, Preminger became increasingly reclusive, due in part to his worsening health. He spent his final years under the care of his son Erik Lee Preminger, with whom he had a difficult but ultimately reconciled relationship. Despite his prickly reputation, Preminger's contribution to the world of film and theater continues to be celebrated by critics and audiences alike.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by alzheimer&#039;s disease.
