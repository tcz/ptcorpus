					</p><p>Sophie Brack was an Irish personality who was born in Dublin in 1881. She is best known for her work as a stained glass artist and designer. Brack attended the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art where she was greatly influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement. She later worked for the renowned stained glass artist Harry Clarke, and many of her designs were featured in his work. Brack's own stained glass windows can be found in various churches throughout Ireland. In addition to her work in stained glass, she was also a talented watercolorist and illustrator. Brack remained active in her artistic pursuits until her death in 1971.</p><p>She was a member of the Watercolour Society of Ireland and exhibited her watercolour paintings frequently throughout her career. Brack also illustrated several children's books, including "The Slender Greyhound" by Patricia Lynch. Though Brack was an accomplished artist, she remained relatively unknown for much of her life, possibly due to being a woman working in a male-dominated field. However, in recent years, her work has received more recognition and appreciation, with several exhibitions featuring her stained glass windows and watercolours. In 2021, a retrospective exhibition of her work, titled "Sophie Brack: A Life in Art," was held at the National Gallery of Ireland.</p><p>The exhibition showcased Brack's wide-ranging talent and the versatility of her art, which included not only stained glass and watercolour but also embroidery, bookbinding, and printing. Brack's art was deeply rooted in Irish folklore, mythology, and the natural world, and reflected a deep respect for Irish traditions and culture. Her work is highly regarded for its intricate detail, vivid colors, and expressive compositions. Apart from her art career, Brack was also involved in the Irish War of Independence and was an active member of the Irish Women's Suffrage Federation. She lived a long life, passing away at the age of 90, but her legacy lives on through her art, which continues to inspire and captivate audiences to this day.</p><p></p><p>
