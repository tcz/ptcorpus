						</p><p>Leo V the Armenian was a Byzantine emperor who ruled from 813 to 820. He was born in Armenia in 775 CE, and his original name was Vahagn. Leo was a skilled general and was appointed as the strategos of the Anatolikon Theme by Emperor Nikephoros I in 803. Later, he became the general of the Armeniac Theme and, in 813, he usurped the throne from Emperor Michael I Rangabe.</p><p>During his reign, Leo pursued an iconoclastic policy, which was the rejection of icons in religious worship. He abolished the use of icons in churches and persecuted those who disagreed with him, including the monasteries of Mount Athos. Leo also reorganized the theme system, which was the administrative division of the empire.</p><p>Leo was a brilliant military tactician and successfully fought against the Bulgarian army to secure the northern borders of the empire. He also fought against the Arab Abbasid Caliphate, but with limited success. In 820, Leo was assassinated by conspirators, who were likely supporters of the previous emperor, Michael I Rangabe.</p><p>Leo was survived by his son, Constantine, who became emperor after his death. Leo V the Armenian's legacy is mixed, as he was a successful general and strong ruler, but his iconoclastic policies brought about division and persecution in the Byzantine Empire.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in assassination.
