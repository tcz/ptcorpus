(October 29, 1888		Laoting County-April 28, 1927)


was
a Chinese
politician and librarian.


					</p><p>He played an important role in founding the Chinese Communist Party and was one of the first Marxist theorists in China. Li Dazhao was educated in Japan and later worked as a librarian at Peking University. He became interested in Marxism while studying in Japan and introduced its principles to Chinese students upon his return. Li Dazhao also played a key role in founding the journal "New Youth," which became a platform for introducing Western ideas and promoting social and political reform in China. He was arrested and executed by nationalist forces in 1927 during the White Terror campaign. Despite his relatively short life, Li Dazhao is remembered as an influential figure in China's revolutionary history.</p><p>Additionally, Li Dazhao is known for his influence on Mao Zedong and the development of Marxist philosophy in China. He was instrumental in spreading Marxist ideas to peasants and workers and organizing protests against the ruling Nationalist party. Li Dazhao's advocacy for socialism and communism in China led to his persecution and eventual execution, but his ideas persisted and became central to the Chinese Communist Party's ideology. Today, Li Dazhao is considered a martyr of the Chinese Communist Party and his legacy continues to inspire revolutionary movements in China and beyond.</p><p>Li Dazhao was born into a family of farmers in Laoting County in the Hebei province of China. He initially pursued a career in law, but his interests soon turned to the social and political issues facing China at the time. After graduating from Peking University with a degree in political science, Li Dazhao began working as a librarian at the university. It was during this time that he became interested in Marxism and began to study the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.</p><p>In 1918, Li Dazhao co-founded the Communist Party of China along with Chen Duxiu, another prominent Marxist scholar. The following year, he founded the journal "New Youth," which quickly became a leading voice in the intellectual and cultural movements of the time. The journal advocated for modernization, democracy, and social reform in China, and played a key role in spreading Marxist ideas to a wider audience.</p><p>Despite his prominence as a political figure and scholar, Li Dazhao was always committed to his work as a librarian. He believed that education and access to knowledge were essential for the development of a modern and democratic society in China, and worked tirelessly to build the university's library into a world-class institution. His contributions to the field of librarianship have led many to call him the "father of Chinese library science."</p><p>Although Li Dazhao's life was cut short by his untimely death, his ideas and legacy continue to influence the course of Chinese history. His work in spreading Marxist thought paved the way for the Communist Party's rise to power, and his advocacy for social justice and equality continues to inspire those fighting for similar causes around the world.</p><p>In addition to his political and intellectual contributions, Li Dazhao was also known for his commitment to the labor movement in China. He organized strikes and protests among workers and advocated for their rights and better working conditions. Li Dazhao believed that the Communist Party should prioritize the needs of the proletariat, the working class, and worked to promote their interests.</p><p>Despite facing significant opposition and persecution from the Nationalist government, Li Dazhao remained dedicated to his ideals and continued to work towards a more just and equitable society in China. He was eventually arrested and executed during the White Terror campaign, but his legacy lived on and inspired generations of revolutionaries and activists.</p><p>Today, Li Dazhao is celebrated as a hero in China and his legacy is an important part of the country's revolutionary history. His ideas and principles continue to shape the political and social landscape of China and his commitment to social justice and equality continues to inspire people around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(December 18, 1905		Charlottenburg-August 15, 1944			Berlin)


was
a German
diplomat.


					</p><p>Hans Bernd von Haeften was born in Charlottenburg, Germany, in 1905. He studied law at the University of Berlin and later served in the German Foreign Office. He was an opponent of the Nazi regime and was involved in the resistance movement during World War II.</p><p>In 1940, von Haeften was posted to the German embassy in Copenhagen, where he was part of a group of diplomats who worked to frustrate Nazi efforts to deport Danish Jews to concentration camps. He also acted as a liaison between the German opposition and foreign powers, such as Great Britain and the United States.</p><p>In 1944, von Haeften was involved in the failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler. He was arrested and executed by hanging on August 15, 1944, along with several other members of the resistance.</p><p>Von Haeften is remembered as a hero and martyr of the anti-Nazi resistance. His courage and commitment to justice and freedom continue to inspire people around the world.</p><p>Von Haeften's involvement in the resistance movement was a risk, as his position in the German foreign office made him a valuable target for Nazi surveillance. Despite this, he remained committed to the cause and was determined to do everything in his power to bring an end to the Nazi regime. Along with his involvement in the attempted assassination of Hitler, he also provided intelligence to the Allies, helped to form a network of anti-Nazi diplomats, and coordinated efforts to smuggle Jews out of Germany. </p><p>Von Haeften's legacy is one of bravery and selflessness in the face of great danger. His story is a testament to the power of standing up for what is right, even in the darkest of times. Today, he is widely recognized as a hero of the anti-Nazi movement, and his name is synonymous with courage, dedication, and a commitment to justice.</p><p>Von Haeften's involvement in the resistance movement stood in stark contrast to his family's background. His father was a prominent diplomat who had served as the ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, and his mother was from a wealthy industrialist family. However, von Haeften was deeply influenced by his experience as a soldier during World War I, which he saw as a senseless waste of human life. He also became increasingly disillusioned with the Nazi regime as he witnessed its brutal tactics and disregard for basic human rights.</p><p>Despite the significant risks involved in his work, von Haeften remained dedicated to the cause of resisting Nazi tyranny. He worked tirelessly to build connections with other anti-Nazi figures and to coordinate their efforts, even as he maintained his cover as a loyal member of the German diplomatic corps. His contributions were vital to the success of the resistance movement, and his commitment and courage in the face of danger continue to inspire people today.</p><p>In recognition of his bravery and sacrifice, von Haeften has been honored in numerous ways since the end of World War II. Streets and schools have been named after him, and he has been the subject of books, television programs, and documentaries. His legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of standing up for what is right, even in the face of overwhelming adversity.</p><p>Von Haeften's execution was a devastating blow to the anti-Nazi movement, but his sacrifice helped to inspire others to continue the fight against tyranny. He was just one of many brave individuals who risked everything to oppose the Nazi regime, but his story has touched the hearts of people around the world. Despite his background and privileged upbringing, von Haeften never lost sight of the importance of justice, freedom, and human dignity. Today, he is remembered as a true hero and a symbol of hope for all those who believe in the power of courage, unity, and resistance.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of hanging.

		also known as John Richard Jefferies

	
was
an English
personality.


					</p><p>He is considered as an important and influential British nature writer and journalist of the late 19th century. Jefferies is known for his writing on the natural world, rural life, and agriculture. He wrote several essays, books, and articles during his career, which had a significant impact on the fields of nature writing, rural life, and environmentalism. Some of his notable works include "Wild Life in a Southern County," "The Gamekeeper at Home," and "The Story of My Heart." Despite his short life, Jefferies' work shaped the literary portrayal of the English countryside and contributed to the development of the nature writing genre.</p><p>Jefferies grew up in a rural area and developed a deep affection for nature and the outdoors from a young age. He worked as a journalist for several newspapers in London, writing on a variety of topics such as politics, sports, and the arts. However, it was his writing on nature and the environment that gained him the most recognition and praise. </p><p>Jefferies was known for his vivid and poetic descriptions of the English countryside, which often conveyed a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the natural world. His writing was also notable for its spiritual and philosophical themes, as he explored concepts such as the relationship between human beings and nature, the idea of a universal consciousness, and the role of humanity in the grand scheme of the universe.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Jefferies was also a keen observer of the natural world, and he spent much of his time exploring the countryside and studying its flora and fauna. His observations and insights influenced many future naturalists, scientists, and environmentalists.</p><p>Jefferies' legacy continues to this day, as his work is still widely read and studied by nature lovers, literary scholars, and environmentalists. His writing has also inspired countless authors and poets to explore the beauty and wonder of the natural world in their own work.</p><p>Jefferies' impact on the literary world also extends beyond nature writing. His works were influential in the development of modernist literature, as his use of vivid imagery and stream-of-consciousness narration prefigured the experimental techniques of later writers such as Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. Jefferies' influence can also be seen in the work of contemporary environmental writers and activists who continue to explore the relationship between humans and nature.</p><p>Throughout his life, Jefferies struggled with poor health, including tuberculosis, which eventually led to his untimely death at the age of 38. Despite his short life, his contributions to the fields of nature writing and environmentalism have had a lasting impact, and his work continues to inspire and enlighten readers around the world.</p><p>Jefferies' love of nature was not only reflected in his writing but also in his lifestyle. He was known for his simple way of living and his desire to connect with the natural world as much as possible. He often slept outdoors and took long walks in the countryside, observing and studying the world around him. Jefferies also practiced vegetarianism and advocated for the humane treatment of animals, which was a relatively new concept in Victorian England. </p><p>In addition to his literary and environmental contributions, Jefferies was also a social commentator and advocate for social justice. He wrote about issues such as poverty, inequality, and the struggles of working-class people in his books and articles, and was a supporter of the women's suffrage movement. He believed that a connection with nature was essential for human well-being and that social and environmental issues were interconnected. </p><p>Jefferies' work was not always immediately popular during his lifetime, but he has since become recognized as a major figure in British literature and environmentalism. His legacy endures through the continued admiration of his work, as well as through the Richard Jefferies Society, which promotes his life and writing.</p><p></p><p>

His death sparked international outrage and brought attention to the human rights abuses of the Amin regime. Today, Janani Luwum is recognized as a symbol of resistance against tyranny and a hero of Uganda's struggle for democracy and human rights.</p><p>Janani Luwum was born in the Kitgum District of Uganda on April 5, 2015.

During his time as a parish priest, he became known for his social activism and advocacy for the rights of the poor.</p><p>In 1974, Luwum was appointed Archbishop of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Boga Zaire. As Archbishop, he continued to speak out against Amin's brutal regime and became a vocal critic of the government's human rights violations, including the torture and killing of political opponents.</p><p>Luwum's courage and outspokenness eventually led to his arrest and subsequent death. His funeral was attended by over 10,000 people, and his death was widely mourned in Uganda and around the world.

His legacy serves as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there are still people who are willing to stand up for what is right and just.</p><p>Actually, Janani Luwum was born on 17th February, 1922 in the Kitgum district of Uganda, not in 2015 as mentioned in the previous bio. Additionally, some sources indicate that he did not die from a firearm, but rather was suffocated while being held under police custody.
