(May 28, 1738		Saintes, Charente-Maritime-March 26, 1814			Paris)


was
an English
physician and politician.


					</p><p>Joseph-Ignace Guillotin is most widely known for proposing and advocating for the use of the guillotine as a more humane and efficient method of execution during the French Revolution. However, it is important to note that he did not actually invent the machine but rather suggested its use to the National Assembly in 1789.</p><p>Born to a family of French nobility, Guillotin studied medicine in Paris and later became involved in politics as a representative of the Third Estate. He was a strong advocate for social and political reform and was one of the authors of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen.</p><p>Despite his contributions to the Revolution, Guillotin actually opposed the use of violence and was a proponent of the use of education and reason to bring about change. He later fell out of favor with the revolutionaries and was himself briefly imprisoned during the Reign of Terror.</p><p>Guillotin lived to see the end of the Revolution and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. He continued to practice medicine throughout his life and was also a professor of anatomy. He died at the age of 75 and was buried in Paris, where his grave can still be visited today.</p><p>Guillotin was an active member of the French Academy of Medicine and co-founder of the Société Philotechnique, which aimed to promote scientific and technological progress in France. In addition to his medical and political work, Guillotin was also interested in economics and advocated for the establishment of a progressive income tax. </p><p>Despite his legacy being forever tied to the guillotine, Guillotin himself never actually witnessed an execution by the device. He remained ambivalent about its use and reportedly said that he hoped it would be used sparingly.</p><p>After his death, the use of the guillotine continued in France for over a century and became a symbol of the brutality of the French Revolution. Today, the term "guillotine" is often used metaphorically to describe swift and decisive action.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of natural causes.
