		also known as Edwin Powell Hubble

	
was
an American
astronomer and physicist.


					</p><p>Hubble played a crucial role in revolutionizing our understanding of the universe, particularly in the field of extragalactic astronomy. He was instrumental in the discovery of the expanding nature of the universe and the development of Hubble's Law, which states that the speed of recession of a galaxy from the Milky Way is proportional to its distance from us. Hubble was also the first to identify the existence of galaxies beyond the Milky Way, and he classified them into different types.
 
In addition to his groundbreaking work in astronomy, Hubble also contributed to the development of military technology during World War I while serving as an officer in the U.S. Army. He was awarded the Medal of Merit by President Truman for his wartime efforts. Hubble received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to the field of astronomy, including the National Medal of Science and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. Today, Hubble's name is most famously associated with the Hubble Space Telescope, which was named in his honor and has captured some of the most stunning images of the universe since its launch in 1990.</p><p>Hubble was born in Marshfield, Missouri, in 1889. He showed an early interest in science and astronomy, and went on to study mathematics and astronomy at the University of Chicago. After earning his PhD in 1917, he served as a civilian astronomer for the U.S. Army, where he was tasked with developing technologies for detecting submarines during World War I. </p><p>Following the war, Hubble returned to astronomy and began studying nebulae, or clouds of gas and dust in space. In 1923, he made a groundbreaking discovery that changed the course of astronomy: the Andromeda Nebula, previously thought to be a part of the Milky Way, was actually a separate galaxy located millions of light-years away. This discovery paved the way for the study of other galaxies and the development of modern cosmology.</p><p>Throughout his career, Hubble made numerous contributions to our understanding of the universe, including the discovery of Cepheid variable stars, which allowed astronomers to accurately measure distances in space. He also proved the existence of dark matter, a mysterious substance that makes up a significant portion of the universe's mass.</p><p>Hubble's work in astronomy and cosmology had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Today, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest astronomers of the 20th century, and his name lives on through the Hubble Space Telescope, which continues to capture stunning images of the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>

He went on to serve in the Mexican-American War and was an admired officer.</p><p>When the Civil War broke out, Lee initially opposed secession and hoped for a peaceful resolution. However, when his home state of Virginia seceded, he resigned from the U.S. Army and joined the Confederate Army. Lee quickly became one of the South's most successful generals and is known for his tactical brilliance on the battlefield.</p><p>After the Civil War ended, Lee became the president of Washington College in Lexington, Virginia (now Washington and Lee University). He worked to rebuild the college, which had suffered during the war, and was beloved by his students.</p><p>Despite his reputation as a military genius, Lee's legacy has become controversial in recent years due to his support of slavery and the Confederacy. Some have argued that he should not be celebrated, while others argue that he played an important role in American history and should be remembered for both his successes and his flaws.</p><p>Lee grew up on his family's Stratford plantation in Virginia and was educated privately until he went to West Point at the age of 18. After graduating, he served in the U.S. Army for over 30 years and became a prominent figure in the American military. Lee is known for his leadership skills and was respected by both Union and Confederate soldiers.</p><p>During the Civil War, Lee commanded the Army of Northern Virginia and played a major role in many of the war's most significant battles, including the Battle of Gettysburg. However, his Confederate forces were ultimately defeated, and he surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House in April 1865.</p><p>Following the war, Lee became a symbol of southern pride and a controversial figure in American history. Despite his victories on the battlefield, his support of slavery and the Confederacy has led to criticism of his legacy.</p><p>Today, Lee's life and career continue to be studied and debated by historians and academics alike. There are monuments and memorials dedicated to Lee throughout the United States, but many have been removed in recent years due to controversy surrounding their symbolism.</p><p></p><p>

philosopher, professor and author.


					</p><p>Nozick was best known for his book "Anarchy, State, and Utopia," which won the National Book Award for Philosophy and Religion in 1975. He taught at Harvard University for over two decades, and was a leading figure in the libertarian movement in the United States. Nozick's other notable works include "The Examined Life" and "Philosophical Explanations." He was also a prominent commentator on ethical, political, and metaphysical issues, and his contributions to these fields are widely studied and discussed to this day.

He grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and attended Columbia University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1959. He went on to earn a master's degree and a doctorate in philosophy from Princeton University in 1961 and 1963, respectively.</p><p>Nozick's philosophy was heavily influenced by the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the Austrian School of economics. He rejected utilitarianism and other forms of consequentialist ethics, arguing instead for a rights-based approach to morality. In "Anarchy, State, and Utopia," Nozick defended the idea of a minimal state that exists solely to protect individual rights and liberties.</p><p>Despite his libertarian views, Nozick was known for his collegiality and willingness to engage with thinkers from a wide range of ideological backgrounds. He was also committed to social justice and served on the board of the Children's Defense Fund.</p><p>After his death, some commentators criticized Nozick for his limited engagement with issues of race and gender.
