was
an Italian
poet.


					</p><p>He is best known for his epic poem, "Jerusalem Delivered", which tells the story of the First Crusade in verse. Tasso was a prolific writer, producing works in a variety of genres, including pastoral poetry, dialogues, and plays. His work had a profound influence on Italian literature and he is regarded as one of the most important writers of the Renaissance. Tasso's life was not without controversy; he was imprisoned for several years due to his erratic behavior and alleged heresy. Despite his tumultuous life, Tasso's literary legacy continues to inspire readers and writers today.</p><p>Tasso was born into a family of poets and writers, and he showed a talent for poetry at a young age. He studied at the University of Padua and later worked as a courtier for various members of the Italian nobility. His masterpiece, "Jerusalem Delivered," was published in 1581 and quickly became a sensation throughout Europe. The poem tells the story of the Christian crusaders who conquered Jerusalem in the late 11th century, and is a celebration of bravery, chivalry, and faith. Tasso's use of language and his vivid descriptions of battle scenes and courtly love have made the poem a classic of Italian literature. In addition to his literary achievements, Tasso was also a respected scholar and linguist. He translated the epic poem "Gerusalemme Liberata" into Latin, French, and Spanish, and wrote treatises on language and grammar. Tasso's tragic personal life, which included a lifelong struggle with mental illness, has also been the subject of much scrutiny and speculation. Nevertheless, his works continue to be read and admired today by scholars and poetry lovers alike.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1784		Gallicano-August 17, 1835			Florence)


was
an Italian
physicist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering contributions to the field of thermoelectricity. Nobili developed several instruments, including the thermocouple and the thermo pile, which allowed for more accurate measurements of temperature and helped advance the study of thermoelectric phenomena. He also conducted extensive experiments on electrochemistry, discovering several new properties of solutions and developing methods for their analysis. Nobili served as a professor of physics at the University of Florence and was elected to the Royal Society of London in 1827. His pioneering work in the field of thermoelectricity earned him widespread recognition and established him as one of the most important scientists of his time.</p><p>In addition to his work in thermoelectricity and electrochemistry, Leopoldo Nobili also made significant contributions to the study of magnetism. He developed an innovative technique for measuring magnetic force, which involved suspending a magnetized needle with a silk thread and measuring its oscillations in response to changes in magnetic field. Nobili's research in this area helped to lay the foundation for later work in magnetic measurements and the study of geomagnetism. </p><p>Nobili was a prolific author and published numerous articles and treatises throughout his career. His most notable works include "Ricerche sulla Maggiore Densità delle Correnti in una Sostanza Galvanica," which detailed his experimental investigations into the conduction of electricity through solutions, and "Memorie sulla Termoelettricità e sulla Caloria," a comprehensive summary of his research on thermoelectric phenomena. </p><p>In recognition of his many achievements, Nobili received numerous honors during his lifetime, including the Order of the Crown of Italy and the French Legion of Honor. He also served as the President of the Italian Physical Society and was a member of several prestigious scientific organizations, including the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome. Today, Nobili is remembered as one of the most important scientists of the early 19th century and his pioneering work in the fields of thermoelectricity, electrochemistry, and magnetism continues to inspire researchers to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(August 15, 1432		Florence-April 5, 1484)


was
an Italian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a poet and one of the most important Florentine humanists of his time. Pulci is best known for his epic poem Morgante, which was completed in 1460. Morgante is a satirical work that tells the story of a giant, Morgante, who becomes the faithful servant of the knight Orlando. The poem is notable for its use of Tuscan dialect and the incorporation of comedy, satire, and social commentary.</p><p>In addition to his literary works, Pulci was also involved in politics and was a member of the Medici court in Florence. He wrote several poems in praise of the Medici family, including one commemorating the marriage of Lorenzo il Magnifico.</p><p>Pulci's legacy is significant in the development of Italian literature, particularly in the use of vernacular language and the incorporation of humor into epic poetry.</p><p>In addition to his notable work as a poet, Luigi Pulci was also known for his friendships with other prominent Renaissance figures, such as the philosopher Marsilio Ficino and the painter Sandro Botticelli. Pulci was active in the literary and cultural circles of 15th-century Florence, and his work was particularly influential in the development of the chivalric romance genre. Later writers such as Ludovico Ariosto and Torquato Tasso drew inspiration from Pulci's use of humor and satire in epic poetry. Pulci's literary style and political affiliations have also been the subject of scholarly debate, with some critics viewing his work as a critique of the Medici regime and others emphasizing his role as a court poet. Regardless of these interpretations, Pulci's contributions to the cultural and literary history of Florence remain significant.</p><p></p><p>
