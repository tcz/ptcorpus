In addition to his successful acting and producing career, Lawford was also known for his high-profile relationships, including a marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President John F. Kennedy.

He was expelled from the Rat Pack in 1963 due to his excessive drinking and drug abuse, which led to the decline of his career in Hollywood. In 1975, Lawford was charged with statutory rape of a minor, but the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. He later wrote a book titled "The Peter Lawford Story," in which he discussed his struggles with addiction and personal relationships with famous individuals, including Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland. Lawford's life was also rumored to be the basis for the character of Nick Charles in the film "The Thin Man." Despite his personal and legal struggles, Lawford was remembered by many for his charm, wit, and talent on and off the screen.</p><p></p><p>
