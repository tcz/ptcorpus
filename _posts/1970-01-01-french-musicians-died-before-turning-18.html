was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>Actually, Claus Sluter was a German-born Dutch sculptor who worked in France. He lived from approximately 1340 to 1405 and is known for his intricate and lifelike sculptures. Sluter worked primarily for the Duke of Burgundy, creating works including the famous Well of Moses in the Chartreuse de Champmol. His works are considered some of the most masterful and influential of the Gothic period.</p><p>Sluter began his career as an assistant to the sculptor John of Liège, and continued to work in a collaborative style throughout his career. He is particularly known for his use of naturalistic details and dramatic expressions to bring his sculptures to life. In addition to the Well of Moses, he created several other notable works, including the portal of the Chartreuse de Champmol and a statue of King Philip the Bold. Despite the acclaim he received during his lifetime, much of his work was destroyed or lost over the centuries, making surviving examples all the more precious. Sluter's influence on the development of sculpture in Europe can still be felt today.</p><p>Sluter's artistic genius extended beyond just sculpture, as he also contributed to the fields of architecture, painting, and decorative arts. His innovative approach to sculpting, which featured anatomically correct and emotionally expressive figures, was a departure from the stiff, stylized figures of his contemporaries.</p><p>Many artists who studied under Sluter went on to become influential in their own right, including Michael Pacher and Michel Colombe. Sluter's style also influenced the likes of the Italian Renaissance sculptor Donatello.</p><p>Today, several of Sluter's surviving works can be seen in the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Dijon, France, as well as in other museums and collections across Europe. His impact on the world of sculpture and European art as a whole is immeasurable, and his legacy continues to inspire artists and admirers today.</p><p>Despite his lasting legacy, very little is known about Claus Sluter's personal life. It is believed that he was born in Haarlem, the Netherlands, and later moved to Dijon, France, where he spent most of his career. Sluter's reputation quickly grew, and he became one of the most sought-after artists in Europe during his time. </p><p>Throughout his career, Sluter worked closely with the powerful Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Bold, and later with his successor, John the Fearless. It was under their patronage that Sluter created his most famous work, the Well of Moses, which depicts six prophets and six apostles surrounding a statue of Moses holding the Ten Commandments. The sculpture is known for its intricate detail, naturalistic representation, and expressionistic figures. </p><p>Sluter's impact on the world of art is profound, extending far beyond the Gothic period in which he worked. His emphasis on realism and emotional expression would be embraced by artists across Europe for centuries to come, paving the way for the humanistic approach to art that would dominate in the Renaissance and beyond.</p><p></p><p>

was
a French
philosopher.


					</p><p>He lived in the 12th century and was known for his influential ideas on knowledge and education. Bernard of Chartres is perhaps most famous for his metaphor of "standing on the shoulders of giants," which expressed the idea that all knowledge is built on the foundation of the knowledge that has come before. He believed in the importance of learning from the past and advancing knowledge through the collective efforts of many individuals. Bernard of Chartres was a prominent figure in the intellectual circles of his time, and his ideas had a lasting impact on the development of Western philosophy and education.</p><p>Bernard of Chartres was born in the mid-11th century in France, and he later became the headmaster of the Cathedral school in Chartres. He was a renowned teacher and attracted many students from across Europe, including future bishops and scholars. Bernard of Chartres' philosophy centered on the concept of illumination, which he believed was a collaboration between the divine and human intellects. He argued that human beings were capable of achieving a higher level of understanding through education and that knowledge was a tool for self-improvement and intellectual advancement. Bernard of Chartres was also interested in the natural sciences and believed that mathematical principles were key to understanding the world. His teachings greatly influenced the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and continue to be a source of inspiration for thinkers today. Bernard of Chartres died in the late 12th century, but his legacy as a philosopher and educator has lived on for centuries.</p><p>In addition to his teachings on education and knowledge, Bernard of Chartres was also known for his work in architectural theory. He was part of a group of scholars who believed that the beauty and harmony of architecture had a powerful impact on the human spirit. Bernard of Chartres wrote extensively on this topic, and his ideas helped shape the Gothic style of architecture that emerged in France in the 12th century. His belief in the importance of beautiful and meaningful design reflected his broader view of the world as an ordered and harmonious structure that could be understood through reason and intellect. Despite his extensive contributions to philosophy, education, and architecture, there are relatively few surviving writings from Bernard of Chartres, and much of his work has been lost over time. Nonetheless, his influence on Western culture and intellectual history is significant, and his metaphor of "standing on the shoulders of giants" remains an enduring symbol of the importance of learning and knowledge.</p><p>Bernard of Chartres was also known for his role in preserving and translating the works of ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle and Plato. He believed that these texts were essential for understanding the foundations of Western thought and sought to make them more accessible to scholars throughout Europe. Bernard of Chartres' efforts were instrumental in the revival of Aristotelian philosophy in the 12th century, and he is considered one of the early pioneers of scholasticism, the intellectual movement that dominated European education for centuries. Additionally, Bernard of Chartres was admired for his personal character and piety, and he was widely respected for his humility and modesty. Despite his achievements and influence, he remained committed to a life of simplicity and service, and his example inspired many others in his time and beyond.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 2015		France-April 5, 2015)

	
		also known as Roscellin

	
was
a French
philosopher.


					</p><p>Roscellinus was a prominent figure during the medieval period and is often regarded as one of the founders of nominalism, a philosophical theory that asserts that abstract concepts and general terms are mere verbal labels with no independent existence in the real world. He was also a prominent theologian and teacher, who became embroiled in a controversial debate with prominent thinkers of his time, including Peter Abelard and William of Champeaux, over the nature of the Holy Trinity. Although his views were controversial and sparked much debate, Roscellinus' contributions to philosophy and theology continue to be studied and debated by scholars today.</p><p>Roscellinus was born in Compiègne, France in the year 1050. His life and teachings were heavily influenced by the intellectual and religious climate of his time, which was characterized by intense debate and discussion about the nature of truth, reality, and God. Roscellinus became a teacher and professor of grammar and logic in Normandy and Paris, where he began to develop his philosophical ideas and theories.</p><p>His most famous work, "De Generibus et Speciebus," ("On Genera and Species") expounded his nominalist views, arguing that abstract concepts and general terms are merely words that do not correspond to any objective reality. This view put him at odds with many of his contemporaries, including some of the most prominent theologians of the time.</p><p>Roscellinus' involvement in the Trinitarian controversy began in the 1090s when he argued that the three persons of the Trinity were not distinct entities, but rather divisions or parts of a single being. This controversy resulted in his excommunication from the Church, although he later recanted his views and was reconciled with the Church.</p><p>Roscellinus' legacy is still debated by scholars today. Some see him as a bold thinker who challenged the prevailing views of his time and promoted a more sophisticated understanding of language and truth. Others view him as an unreliable and disruptive figure, whose ideas were ultimately unsound and misguided. Regardless of the diversity of opinions on his contributions, Roscellinus remains an interesting and valuable figure in the history of philosophy and theology.</p><p>In addition to his philosophical and theological contributions, Roscellinus was also known for his influence on future generations of thinkers. His nominalist theory paved the way for the development of modern linguistic philosophy, and his ideas about the nature of the Trinity influenced later theologians and Church councils. Despite his controversies and excommunication, Roscellinus remained a respected figure in the intellectual circles of his time, and his legacy continues to be celebrated by scholars and students of philosophy and theology.</p><p>Roscellinus' impact on the study of language and logic has been profound. His nominalist view that concepts and general terms are mere verbal labels and not objective realities influenced many philosophers and linguists who followed him, including William of Ockham and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Moreover, his ideas about language and truth helped pave the way for the development of modern logic and semiotics.</p><p>Furthermore, Roscellinus' influence on the development of Trinitarian theology cannot be overstated. Although his views were ultimately deemed to be heretical by the Church, his ideas pushed theologians to develop more nuanced and sophisticated understandings of the Trinity. His ideas were also influential in the debates surrounding the authority of Church councils and the limitations of human reason in theological matters.</p><p>Overall, Roscellinus remains a complex and controversial figure, whose legacy is still debated by scholars today. Regardless of one's opinions on his contributions, however, it is clear that he was a deeply influential thinker whose ideas continue to shape the intellectual landscape of philosophy and theology.</p><p></p><p>
