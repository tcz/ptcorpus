He helped launch the careers of several popular rock and roll artists, such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his career, Alan Freed remained a beloved figure among rock and roll fans and his legacy continues to influence popular music today.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to radio and film, Freed was also a prolific writer, penning articles and reviews for music magazines such as Rock and Roll Illustrated and Record Mirror. He even wrote a book on his experiences in the music industry, titled "The Big Beat: Conversations with the Stars". </p><p>Freed's impact on pop culture goes beyond just music. He influenced fashion and language, with his catchphrase "rock and roll" becoming a widely-used term. He was also an advocate for racial integration, featuring both white and black artists on his shows and concerts.</p><p>Despite his success, Freed faced numerous legal and financial challenges in his career. He declared bankruptcy in 1959 and was fired from his radio jobs amidst the payola scandal. He was later charged with tax evasion in 1962, leading to a prison sentence.</p><p>While Freed's life was cut short due to his heavy drinking, his contributions to rock and roll music and popular culture continue to be celebrated today. In addition to his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, several films and documentaries have been made about his life and impact.</p><p></p><p>

was
an American
film director, actor, screenwriter, television director, film editor and film producer.


					
			
		He had
		three
		children,
		Nick Cassavetes, Alexandra Cassavetes and Zoe Cassavetes.

						</p><p>Cassavetes is considered a pioneer of American independent cinema due to his improvisational approach to filmmaking and his dedication to creating films on his own terms, outside of the Hollywood studio system. He directed and starred in several influential films, including "Shadows", "Faces", and "A Woman Under the Influence", which earned an Academy Award nomination for its female lead, Gena Rowlands, who was also Cassavetes' wife. In addition to his work in films, Cassavetes acted in numerous television shows and movies, including "The Dirty Dozen" and "Rosemary's Baby". He passed away in 1989 from cirrhosis of the liver.</p><p>Cassavetes was born in New York City to Greek immigrant parents, Katherine and Nicholas Cassavetes. He attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and began his career as an actor, appearing in various stage productions and television shows. He made his film debut in 1956 with a small role in "Crime in the Streets". However, after feeling frustrated with the limited range of characters he was offered, he decided to delve into writing and directing his own films.</p><p>Cassavetes' films were known for their raw, unpolished look and feel, and dealt with complex interpersonal relationships and characters who struggled with their own identities. He often cast his wife, Gena Rowlands, in leading roles, and their collaboration is considered one of the greatest partnerships in the history of American cinema. </p><p>Despite initially struggling to secure funding for his films, Cassavetes never compromised his artistic vision, and his work has had a lasting impact on independent and avant-garde cinema. He inspired a generation of filmmakers who admired his commitment to authenticity and improvisation, and his influence can be seen in the work of directors like Martin Scorsese, Jim Jarmusch, and the Coen Brothers.</p><p>In addition to his cinematic accomplishments, Cassavetes was a devoted husband and father, and he often included his family in his productions. His son, Nick Cassavetes, has become a successful director in his own right, directing films like "The Notebook" and "Alpha Dog".</p><p>Cassavetes was also known for his unconventional and collaborative way of making films. He would often work without a script and encourage his actors to improvise and find their own way through the scenes. This approach led to some of the most honest and natural performances ever captured on film. Cassavetes was fiercely independent and refused to compromise his artistic integrity, even if it meant struggling to finance his projects.</p><p>Despite his contributions to cinema, Cassavetes was never fully recognized by the mainstream film industry during his lifetime. However, his influence has only grown since his death, and his legacy as a pioneer of independent cinema continues to inspire generations of filmmakers.</p><p>In addition to his filmmaking career, Cassavetes was also a passionate jazz musician and often played piano at home. He was well-read and had a keen interest in philosophy and existentialism. Cassavetes was known for his warm and generous personality, his sharp wit, and his dedication to his craft.</p><p></p><p>

(February 23, 1920		Bangor-November 24, 1972			New York City)

	
		a.k.a. Hall Franklin Overton or Hal Overton

	
was
an American
music teacher, composer, jazz pianist and music arranger.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Rick Overton and Steven Overton.

						</p><p>Overton was born in Bangor, Maine but grew up in San Francisco, California. He attended the San Francisco Conservatory of Music before moving to New York City to study with legendary composer and music theorist, Stefan Wolpe. Overton became a well-known figure in the jazz scene of the 1950s and 60s, working with such musicians as Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Thelonious Monk. </p><p>In addition to his work in jazz, Overton was a highly regarded music educator. He taught at several institutions including The New School for Social Research, Manhattan School of Music, and the Juilliard School. Overton was also a sought-after arranger, having worked on albums with John Coltrane, Bill Evans, and others. </p><p>Overton is perhaps best known for his work as the musical director for the television program, The Sound of Jazz. He was responsible for arranging the music for the show's notable jam session featuring some of the most famous jazz musicians of the time, including Count Basie, Coleman Hawkins, and Lester Young. </p><p>Tragically, Overton died at the age of 52 from a heart attack. Despite his relatively short career, he is still regarded as an important figure in the history of jazz and music education.</p><p>Overton was known for his unique approach to music education, which emphasized improvisation and individual style. He believed that music theory should not serve as a constraint on creativity but rather as a way to unlock the full potential of an artist's unique voice. This philosophy is evident in his work as a teacher and arranger. Overton is also remembered for his contributions to the avant-garde jazz movement, particularly his collaborations with saxophonist John Coltrane. The two musicians worked together on several projects, including the album "Live at the Village Vanguard Again!" which is considered one of Coltrane's greatest recordings. Overton's legacy continues to be celebrated by musicians and educators alike, and his work in jazz and music education remains a source of inspiration to this day.</p><p>In addition to his collaborations with other jazz musicians, Overton was also a prolific composer. He wrote music for a number of television shows and films, including The Bell Telephone Hour and The World of Henry Orient. Overton was also a member of the prestigious American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). One of his most notable compositions is "Jazz Patterns," a collection of exercises and etudes designed to help musicians develop their improvisational skills. The book has since become a standard reference for jazz educators and is widely used in music schools around the world.</p><p>Overton's influence extended beyond the world of jazz and music education. He was also a vocal advocate for civil rights and used his platform as a musician and educator to promote racial equality. Overton, who was white, often performed and collaborated with black musicians at a time when racial segregation was still prevalent in many parts of the United States. He was also an early supporter of free jazz and experimental music, and his collaborations with avant-garde musicians helped to expand the boundaries of the jazz genre.</p><p>Today, Overton's contributions to jazz and music education are widely acknowledged, and he is remembered as a pioneering figure in the development of modern jazz pedagogy. His unique approach to music education, which emphasized creativity and individual expression, continues to inspire musicians and educators around the world.</p><p></p><p>

					</p><p>He is best known for being the lead vocalist of the blues-rock band, Big Brother and the Holding Company, which rose to fame in the late 1960s. Turner joined the band in 1987, after the departure of previous lead singer, Janis Joplin. Prior to his time with Big Brother and the Holding Company, Turner performed with several other bands, including The Randy Turner Band and The Texas Instruments. Throughout his career, he was noted for his raw and powerful vocal style, which drew comparisons to Joplin's iconic sound. In addition to his work in music, Turner was also an accomplished painter and graphic artist. He passed away in 2005 at the age of 55, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most notable blues-rock singers of his era.</p><p>Turner was born and raised in Gladewater, Texas, and began his music career in the late 1960s while attending college in Austin. He quickly gained a reputation as a dynamic performer, known for his high-energy live shows and soulful singing. However, it wasn't until his time with Big Brother and the Holding Company that he achieved mainstream success. During his tenure with the band, Turner recorded two albums, "Can't Go Home Again" and "Do What You Love," and toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe. Despite his success with Big Brother and the Holding Company, Turner continued to pursue his solo career, releasing several solo albums throughout the 1990s and 2000s. In addition to his music and art, Turner was also a passionate advocate for animal rights and environmental causes, and frequently supported these organizations through benefit concerts and other events. Although his life was tragically cut short by cancer in 2005, Turner's impact on the blues-rock genre continues to be felt to this day.</p><p>Prior to gaining attention with Big Brother and the Holding Company, Turner was an active member of the Austin music scene, performing with various local bands such as the Rastafarians and Mother Earth. He briefly left the music industry in the early 1980s to pursue a career in graphic design, but eventually returned to music and formed The Randy Turner Band. He also collaborated with other musicians such as Tracy Nelson and Marcia Ball.</p><p>In 1992, Turner was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, but continued to perform and record music while undergoing treatments. He released his last album, "Turnerized," in 2003. Turner was also a published author, having written the book "Out of the Basement: From Cheap Trick to DIY Punk in Rockford, Illinois, 1973-2005," which chronicled his experiences in the music industry.</p><p>In addition to his musical and artistic endeavors, Turner was known for his magnetic and larger-than-life personality, as well as his dedication to political and social activism. He frequently spoke out against injustice and inequality, and used his platform to advocate for marginalized communities.</p><p>Following his death in 2005, Turner was posthumously inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame in recognition of his contributions to the city's music scene.</p><p></p><p>
