His contributions to Canadian literature have since been celebrated with numerous awards and honours, including a postage stamp issued by Canada Post in 1961 in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of his birth.</p><p>Lampman began writing poetry at a young age, and was greatly influenced by the Canadian landscape and landscape painting. He was also influenced by the Romantic poets, particularly John Keats. He published his first book of poetry, "Among the Millet and Other Poems", in 1888, which was well received by critics. Lampman went on to publish more collections of poetry, including "Lyrics of Earth" (1895) and "Alcyone" (1899), which was published posthumously. </p><p>In addition to his poetry, Lampman was also known for his literary criticism, and was a regular contributor to the Canadian Magazine, where he wrote reviews of books and poetry.
