The country's population was subject to harsh surveillance, and many were subjected to forced labor and arbitrary arrest.</p><p>Despite the country's isolation and impoverishment, Kim Jong-il presided over a well-funded missile and nuclear weapons program. He was responsible for two nuclear weapons tests, which were conducted in 2006 and 2009, respectively. Kim Jong-il maintained a confrontational stance towards the international community, especially towards the United States and South Korea, and maintained strong political ties with China and Russia.</p><p>Kim Jong-il's death in 2011 triggered a period of uncertainty in North Korean politics. He was succeeded by his third son, Kim Jong-un, who has continued his father's policies of nuclear weapons development and political repression.</p><p>Kim Jong-il was born into a privileged family, as his father Kim Il-sung was a key figure in the Korean War and went on to establish the communist state of North Korea. Kim Jong-il was educated in the Soviet Union and returned to North Korea in the early 1970s to begin his political career. He served in various high-level positions, including head of the country's intelligence agency, before becoming the designated successor to his father.</p><p>During his rule, North Korea faced severe economic hardship due to a combination of factors including international sanctions and mismanagement by the government. Kim Jong-il's regime was also known for its use of propaganda and cult of personality, as well as its strict control over the media and cultural expression.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Kim Jong-il was widely revered by many North Koreans, who saw him as a strong and decisive leader.
