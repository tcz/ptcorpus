Murnau and Joe May.</p><p>During the rise of the Nazi party in the 1930s, von Harbou's career was effectively ended due to her close association with Lang, who had fled Germany after publicly denouncing the regime.

She was eventually released, but her career never fully recovered.</p><p>After the war, von Harbou remained in Germany and continued to write, but her contributions to German cinema were largely forgotten. She died in 1954 at the age of 65.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=505240" title="Wikipedia article about Thea von Harbou">Thea von Harbou on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Eleonora Duse</h2><p><strong>Eleonora Duse</strong>
