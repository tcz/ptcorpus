(February 4, 1906		Wrocław-April 9, 1945			Flossenbürg)


was
a German
theologian, pastor and writer.


					</p><p>Bonhoeffer was a prominent figure in the Protestant Church and a vocal critic of the Nazi regime. He was involved in the resistance against Hitler and was arrested in April 1943. During his time in prison, he continued to write and reflect on his faith and the role of the Church in society. Bonhoeffer's writings, including "The Cost of Discipleship" and "Letters and Papers from Prison," have had a significant impact on theology and Christian thought. Despite his untimely death, his legacy lives on as an example of courage, faith, and commitment to justice.</p><p>Bonhoeffer came from a family of intellectuals and was raised in a religious household. He studied theology and completed his doctorate in 1927 at the age of 21. He went on to travel and teach in various countries, including Spain, England, and the United States. In 1931, he was ordained as a pastor and returned to Germany to work in the Church.</p><p>Bonhoeffer's early criticism of the Nazi regime was rooted in his belief that the Church should be involved in speaking out against political oppression. He opposed the German Christian movement, which sought to align Christianity with Nazism, and established the Confessing Church as an alternative. He became involved in the resistance against Hitler and was eventually arrested and imprisoned.</p><p>During his imprisonment, Bonhoeffer continued to write and reflect on his faith and the historical context in which he found himself. His letters and papers from prison contain powerful insights into the nature of faith, politics, and human suffering.</p><p>Bonhoeffer's death at the hands of the Nazis has made him a martyr and a symbol of resistance against oppression. He continues to be widely read and celebrated by theologians, pastors, and activists around the world.</p><p>Bonhoeffer's theological work centered around the concept of "cheap grace" versus "costly grace," describing cheap grace as the easy path of belief without true obedience, and costly grace as the difficult but necessary path of authentic discipleship. This concept is explored in depth in his book "The Cost of Discipleship," which has become a classic in Christian literature.</p><p>Despite his experiences in prison and facing the brutality of the Nazi regime, Bonhoeffer maintained a deep sense of faith and hope. He is remembered for his commitment to social justice and his belief in the importance of the Church's role in promoting positive change in society.</p><p>In addition to his theological and political work, Bonhoeffer was also known for his personal relationships and close connections with his family and friends. He was engaged to be married before his arrest, and his letters from prison reveal a devoted and caring spirit, even in the face of great adversity.</p><p>Today, Bonhoeffer's legacy continues to inspire individuals and communities around the world to stand up against injustice and oppression, and to live out their faith with authenticity and courage.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Bonhoeffer's legacy continues to inspire people of all faiths and backgrounds. He is recognized as one of the most influential theologians of the 20th century, and his work remains relevant and impactful to this day. The power of his writing and ideas lies in his ability to connect timeless spiritual truths with the concrete challenges of his historical context. His bravery and dedication to justice continue to serve as a model for contemporary movements seeking to create positive change in their communities. Bonhoeffer's remarkable life and contributions are a testament to the transformative power of faith and the enduring quest for human rights and dignity.</p><p></p><p>

(April 11, 1825		Wrocław-August 31, 1864			Carouge)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a fervent socialist, trade unionist, and journalist who played an important role in shaping the labor movement in Germany. Lassalle founded the General German Workers' Association, which was the precursor to the Social Democratic Party of Germany, a major political party in Germany today. He condemned the capitalist system, advocating for workers' rights and greater government intervention in the economy. Lassalle was also known for his intellectual debates with other political theorists, including Karl Marx. He died at the young age of 39 in a dueling accident, but his ideas and contributions to the labor movement continued to influence socialist thought for decades after his death.</p><p>Before his engagement with activism and politics, Lassalle had a career in law and philosophy. He studied law at the universities of Breslau, Berlin, and Heidelberg and later became an advocate for worker's rights. Lassalle's legal defense of a socialist leader in 1863 led to his imprisonment, which sparked widespread protests and ultimately gained him a significant amount of support. Lassalle's political views were heavily influenced by the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his concept of the social contract. His advocacy for the working class and his criticism of capitalist exploitation made him a controversial figure in his time, but his ideas ultimately laid the foundation for the modern socialist movement.</p><p>Lassalle was a gifted orator and writer, known for his fiery speeches and persuasive writing style. In addition to his work as a journalist and activist, he also wrote several books, including "The Philosophy of Heracles" and "The Workingmen's Programme," in which he laid out his vision for a socialist society. He believed that workers should be given a greater say in the decision-making process and that government intervention in the economy was necessary to ensure fair treatment for all.</p><p>Lassalle's legacy continues to be felt in Germany and beyond. His ideas and activism played a key role in the development of the modern labor movement and influenced generations of socialist thinkers. His General German Workers' Association paved the way for the Social Democratic Party of Germany, which dominated German politics for much of the 20th century. Today, Lassalle is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of German socialism, a tireless advocate for workers' rights and a passionate champion of social justice.</p><p>Aside from his impact on German politics, Ferdinand Lassalle was also known for his romantic relationships. He had a tumultuous love affair with the famous author and feminist, Fanny Lewald, which lasted for several years. He later became involved with Helene von Dönniges, the wife of a wealthy Austrian diplomat, which led to his fatal duel with her husband. The circumstances surrounding his death remain shrouded in controversy, with some speculating that he may have intentionally provoked the duel as a way of escaping his increasingly complicated personal life. Regardless of the circumstances, Lassalle's premature death was a significant loss to the socialist movement and his legacy continues to be celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>
