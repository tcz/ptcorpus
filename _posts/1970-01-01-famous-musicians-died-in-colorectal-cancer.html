(December 18, 1913		Lübeck-October 8, 1992			Unkel)

was
a German
politician, journalist, social activist and statesman.


					
			
		He had
		four
		children,
		Ninja Brandt, Matthias Brandt, Peter Brandt and Lars Brandt.

						</p><p>Brandt was a significant figure in post-World War II West German politics and served as Chancellor of West Germany from 1969 to 1974. During his time in office, Brandt focused on improving relations with East Germany and the Soviet Union, known as Ostpolitik, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971. He was also a prominent member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and served as its chairman from 1964 to 1987. Before entering politics, Brandt was a journalist and the editor-in-chief of the social-democratic newspaper Der Sozialdemokrat. He fled Nazi Germany in 1933 and later assumed a new identity with the name Willy Brandt while working as a journalist in Norway during World War II.</p><p>Brandt returned to Germany in 1945 and became involved in politics, rising through the ranks of the Social Democratic Party. As Chancellor, he implemented a number of reforms that helped modernize the country and strengthen its economy, such as expanding social welfare programs and investing in infrastructure. Brandt's efforts to improve relations with East Germany and the Soviet Union were not universally popular, and he faced significant opposition from conservatives and some members of his own party. Despite this, he remained committed to his policies and worked to bring about greater international cooperation and understanding. After leaving office, Brandt continued to be active in politics and diplomacy, serving in various international roles and advocating for peace and human rights. He remains a respected figure in German and European history who played a significant role in shaping the post-war period.</p><p>Brandt was also a vocal opponent of nuclear arms proliferation and worked to promote disarmament during his time in office. In addition to his Nobel Peace Prize, he was awarded numerous other honors and accolades throughout his career, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom from the United States. Brandt was also a noted author and wrote several books on politics and history, including his memoir "My Life in Politics". He passed away in 1992 at the age of 78, but his legacy continues to be celebrated in Germany and beyond. The Willy Brandt Foundation, established in his honor, works to promote democracy, human rights, and social justice around the world.</p><p>Brandt's Ostpolitik policy, which aimed to establish a dialogue with East Germany, was often met with criticism from the conservative opposition and some members of his own party. However, Brandt's steadfast commitment to improving relations with East Germany and the Soviet Union ultimately led to the signing of the Basic Treaty in 1972, which established normal diplomatic relations between West and East Germany for the first time since World War II. Brandt's policy also paved the way for the eventual reunification of Germany in 1990.</p><p>In addition to his work in politics, Brandt was an advocate for social justice and human rights. He supported the civil rights movement in the United States and was a vocal opponent of apartheid in South Africa. Brandt's commitment to these causes earned him the nickname "Internationale Willy."</p><p>Brandt's personal life was also marked by tragedy. In 1948, his first wife, Carlotta Thorkildsen, committed suicide. He later remarried and had four children, but his son, Lars, died in a tragic accident in 1980.</p><p>Today, Brandt is remembered as one of the most significant figures in German and European history. His commitment to peace and international cooperation, as well as his efforts to improve relations between East and West Germany, continue to have a lasting impact on the world today.</p><p></p><p>

(September 4, 1896		Marseille-March 4, 1948			Ivry-sur-Seine)

	
		also known as Artaud, Antonin, Antoine Marie Joseph Paul Artaud, Antoine Marie Joseph Artaud, Artaud A. or Artaud

	
was
a French
writer, actor, playwright, theatre director, poet and screenwriter.


					</p><p>He is best known for his theories on theater, which rejected realism and strived for a visceral and physical experience for both the performers and the audience. Artaud's most famous work, "The Theatre and Its Double," outlines his philosophy of the "Theatre of Cruelty," which aimed to shatter conventional audience expectations and provoke an emotional response through sound, movement, and imagery. Throughout his life, Artaud struggled with mental illness, which greatly influenced his creative output, and he spent much of his adult life in and out of psychiatric hospitals. Despite his troubled life, he remains an influential figure in the worlds of theater, art, and literature to this day.</p><p>Artaud's early life was marked by familial conflict and personal hardship. He was profoundly affected by the early death of his younger brother from meningitis, as well as his mother's subsequent withdrawal from the family. Artaud had a difficult relationship with his father, who placed great pressure on him to succeed academically, leading to frequent clashes between the two.</p><p>Despite these hardships, Artaud began to make a name for himself in the artistic world in Paris in the 1920s, where he associated with some of the most famous writers and artists of the day. He was a member of the Surrealist movement for a time, although his unconventional ideas often put him at odds with his fellow artists.</p><p>Throughout his career, Artaud was a polarizing figure, known for his fiery temperament and his dedication to his artistic vision. He frequently clashed with directors and producers, and his unconventional techniques often left actors feeling confused and alienated. Nevertheless, his impact on the world of theater has been profound, and his ideas continue to inspire artists and thinkers around the world.</p><p>Artaud's artistic output was diverse and prolific, encompassing not just theater but also poetry, prose, and film. He wrote and acted in a number of plays throughout his career, including "Jet of Blood," "The Cenci," and "The Seashell and the Clergyman." He also worked as a screenwriter, collaborating with directors such as Abel Gance and Carl Dreyer.</p><p>In addition to his artistic pursuits, Artaud was deeply interested in indigenous cultures and their traditional forms of performance. He frequently drew on these influences in his own work, incorporating elements of ritual and spiritual practice into his performances.</p><p>Throughout his life, Artaud struggled with addiction and mental illness, which led to several extended stays in psychiatric hospitals. He underwent a number of treatments, including electroshock therapy, and was often heavily medicated. Despite these struggles, he continued to produce art until his untimely death at the age of 51.</p><p>In the years since his death, Artaud's ideas about theater and performance have continued to resonate with artists around the world. His work has been the subject of numerous academic studies and artistic explorations, cementing his position as a truly groundbreaking and provocative figure in the history of theater and the arts.</p><p>Artaud's impact can still be seen today in experimental theater and performance art. Many contemporary artists cite him as an influence and continue to explore his ideas about breaking down boundaries between performer and audience, as well as his interest in exploring the limits of human experience. His legacy also extends to other fields, such as psychoanalysis and cultural studies, where his ideas about the body, language, and the unconscious have continued to be influential. Artaud's life and work are a testament to the power of artistic vision in the face of personal struggle, and serve as an inspiration to generations of artists who seek to challenge and transform the world around them.</p><p></p><p>

					</p><p>Marion Scott was an English musicologist, music critic, and composer. She was primarily known for her work in discovering and promoting the music of French composer Erik Satie. Scott published the first biography of Satie in 1913 and later collaborated with him on various projects. </p><p>Scott was also a talented composer herself, although her works were not as well known as her musicological pursuits. She studied under some of the finest composers of her time, including Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams. </p><p>Throughout her career, Scott contributed to several music-related publications, including The Musical Times and The Observer. She also wrote a book on English songwriters and poets entitled "The Flower of the Mind." </p><p>In addition to her musical accomplishments, Scott was also an advocate for women's suffrage and founded the Society of Women Musicians in 1911 to promote the work of female composers. She continued to work tirelessly to help pave the way for future generations of female musicians until her death in 1953.</p><p>In her early years, Marion Scott studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where she received several awards for her compositions. She later became a music critic for The Daily Telegraph, where she wrote about contemporary composers and performers. Scott's interest in Erik Satie began in 1912 when he submitted some of his works for publication to The New Age, a magazine where Scott was an editor. Impressed by his unique style, Scott sought out Satie and began to work on promoting his music to a wider audience. They collaborated on several projects, including the ballet "Mercure," which was choreographed by Satie and featured music composed by both him and Scott. </p><p>Scott was also an advocate for the rights of female composers, and she worked hard to promote their music through the Society of Women Musicians. In addition to hosting concerts featuring the work of female composers, Scott also wrote articles and gave lectures on the subject. She believed that women had a vital place in the world of music and worked tirelessly to ensure that their contributions were recognized. </p><p>Despite her many achievements, Marion Scott's name is not as well-known as some of her contemporaries. However, her contributions to musicology, composition, and women's rights have left a lasting impact on the world of music. Today, she is remembered as a trailblazer who helped pave the way for future generations of female composers and musicians.</p><p>Later in her career, Marion Scott continued her musicological pursuits by studying and writing about the works of British composers. She was a staunch advocate for the music of her contemporaries and often championed their works in her writing. In addition to her music-related work, Scott was also involved in the Women's Social and Political Union, a suffrage organization that fought for women's right to vote. She regularly attended their meetings and rallies, and even played the piano at some of their events. Scott also wrote articles for the organization's publication, Votes for Women, on the subject of music and its role in the suffrage movement. Despite facing criticism and opposition for her activism, Scott remained dedicated to her beliefs and continued to use her platform to advocate for equality. Marion Scott passed away on December 24, 1953, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking work in musicology, composition, and advocacy for women's rights. Today, she is remembered as a pioneering figure whose contributions to music and society continue to inspire and influence.</p><p>In addition to her work in music and activism, Marion Scott was also an accomplished painter. She studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London and even exhibited her paintings at the Royal Academy. Her paintings often depicted landscapes and portraits, and she was known for her use of vivid colors and bold brushstrokes.
