However, she died in 1931 in mysterious circumstances, which some historians have speculated might have been suicide or murder. </p><p>After Geli's death, Angela's relationship with her half-brother became strained. She moved to Dresden and later to Hanover, where she lived a relatively reclusive life with her husband, who died in 1955. Her daughter Elfriede Hochegger lived with her until her death in 1949. </p><p>Despite her close familial ties to Adolf Hitler, Angela did not share his nationalist or anti-Semitic beliefs.

was
an Austrian
music theorist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his development of the Schenkerian analysis, which is a method of musical analysis that emphasizes the hierarchical relationships between musical structures, and the reduction of a piece of music to its underlying fundamental structure. Schenker's work had a major influence on the development of music theory in the 20th century, and his ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars today. In addition to his analytical work, Schenker was also a prolific composer, although his music is relatively little known today. Despite his significant contributions to the field of music theory, Schenker faced many challenges during his lifetime, including financial difficulties and personal struggles with mental illness.</p><p>Schenker was born in a small town in Austrian Galicia, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He showed an early interest in music and began playing the piano at a young age. He went on to study music theory, composition, and piano at the Vienna Conservatory, where he later became a professor. Schenker's ideas about music were largely influenced by the work of Johann Sebastian Bach, whom he considered to be the greatest composer of all time.</p><p>Schenker's analytical method, which he began to develop in the late 1890s, focused on the ways in which music is structured hierarchically, with each level of structure building upon the one that came before. He believed that all great music had a fundamental structure that could be reduced to a small set of recurring patterns and intervals, which he referred to as the "Urlinie" or "fundamental line." By analyzing a piece of music in this way, Schenker believed that he could uncover its essence and understand the composer's intentions more fully.</p><p>Despite the complexity of his ideas, Schenker was an engaging and influential teacher, and his classes were famous for their intensity and rigor. Many of his students went on to become successful composers and theorists themselves, and his ideas about musical structure continue to be taught in music schools around the world. In addition to his work on music theory, Schenker wrote extensively on music history and aesthetics, and his writings continue to be studied and debated by scholars today.</p><p></p><p>
