		also known as John II Sigismund Zapolya or John Sigismund Szapolyai

	
was
a Hungarian
personality.


					</p><p>He was elected as King of Hungary in 1570 after the death of his father, John Zapolya, but only held the title for a year before dying at the young age of 30. John Sigismund Zápolya was a Protestant, and during his short reign, he worked to promote religious tolerance in Hungary. He issued an edict of religious freedom in 1571, which granted equal rights to all denominations. This edict was ahead of its time, as religious tolerance was not common in Europe at that time. Despite his short reign, John Sigismund Zápolya left a significant impact on Hungarian history, particularly in relation to religious freedom.</p><p>John Sigismund Zápolya was the only son of John Zapolya and Isabella Jagiellon, the sister of King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland. He was educated in Germany and became fluent in German, Hungarian, and Latin. In 1568, he married Sophie Bathory, a member of a powerful Transylvanian noble family. The couple had one daughter together, Anna Zápolya.</p><p>Before becoming king, John Sigismund Zápolya served as the Voivode of Transylvania from 1570 to 1571. He was also a strong supporter of the Protestant Reformation and encouraged the spread of Protestantism throughout Hungary.</p><p>John Sigismund Zápolya's reign was marked by conflict with the Habsburgs, who opposed his rule and sought to take control of Hungary. The Habsburgs were Catholic and saw John Sigismund Zápolya's promotion of religious tolerance as a threat to the Catholic Church. After his death, the Habsburgs gained control of Hungary and implemented strict Catholic policies.</p><p>Today, John Sigismund Zápolya is remembered as a champion of religious freedom and an important figure in Hungarian history. He was posthumously recognized as a martyr of the Reformation by the Lutheran and Calvinist churches. His legacy continues to inspire those who value religious and cultural diversity.</p><p>Furthermore, John Sigismund Zápolya was also known for his patronage of the arts and sciences. He was particularly interested in astronomy and supported the work of Tycho Brahe, a renowned astronomer. John Sigismund Zápolya also funded the construction of several new schools and universities in Hungary, including the University of Nagyszombat (now known as Trnava, in Slovakia). His support for education and scholarship helped to promote intellectual and cultural development in Hungary during a time of political and religious turmoil.</p><p>In addition to his political and intellectual pursuits, John Sigismund Zápolya was also a skilled athlete and equestrian. He was known for his prowess in horseback riding and was said to have participated in several tournaments and jousting competitions. His athleticism and physical prowess were widely admired, and he was a popular figure among both the nobility and common people of Hungary.</p><p>Despite his relatively short life and reign, John Sigismund Zápolya left a lasting impact on Hungarian history and culture. His commitment to religious tolerance, education, and intellectual development set an important precedent for future generations, and his legacy continues to be celebrated in Hungary and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
