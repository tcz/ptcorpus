									</h1><p>Here are 2 famous musicians from Israel died at 37:</p><h2>Baruch Goldstein</h2><p><strong>Baruch Goldstein</strong>
(December 9, 1956		Brooklyn-February 25, 1994			Hebron)

	
		also known as Dr. Baruch Goldstein

	
was
an Israeli
physician.


					</p><p>However, he became infamous for his actions on February 25, 1994, when he entered the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, where Muslims and Jews both worship, and opened fire, killing 29 Palestinian worshipers and injuring over 100 others. Goldstein was eventually overcome and beaten to death by survivors of the attack. The incident was widely condemned and sparked a wave of violence in the region. Goldstein's actions were influenced by his extremist religious views and belief in the necessity of Jewish control over all of Israel, including the occupied territories.</p><p>Goldstein's actions were widely denounced by the Israeli government and the majority of the Jewish community. Many Israelis viewed his actions as a heinous act of terrorism and a stain on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Goldstein's grave in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, near Hebron, has become a pilgrimage site for Jewish extremists who venerate him as a martyr. The Israeli government has since imposed strict security measures in the area to prevent any future incidents of violence. Despite this, Goldstein's attack remains one of the deadliest acts of violence committed by an individual in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p><p>Before his infamous attack, Goldstein served as a physician in the Israeli military and was known for treating both Israeli and Palestinian patients. However, his views on the conflict became increasingly extreme over time. In 1984, Goldstein helped found the Kach political party, which was later banned by the Israeli government for its extreme views and association with violence against Palestinians. Goldstein himself was barred from practicing medicine after refusing to treat non-Jewish patients.</p><p>Goldstein's attack on the Cave of the Patriarchs was not an isolated incident. Violence and tension between Jewish settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank had been increasing for years. The attack was a turning point in the conflict, leading to a spike in violence and retaliation from both sides.</p><p>In the aftermath of the attack, the Israeli government took steps to crack down on extremist groups and settler violence. The incident also led to renewed efforts towards peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine, although progress has been sporadic and limited.</p><p>Goldstein's legacy remains controversial to this day. While many in Israel and around the world condemn his actions as terrorism, there are still those who venerate him as a hero and martyr. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing violence and conflict in the region, and the challenges of achieving a lasting peace.</p><p></p><p>
