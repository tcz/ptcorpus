He died in Munich in 1948, leaving behind a legacy as one of Germany's most influential conductors and composers of the early 20th century.</p><p></p><p>

(February 5, 1795		Vienna-March 19, 1871			Mödling District)

	
		also known as Wilhelm von Haidinger)

	
was
an Austrian
physicist, geologist and mineralogist.


					</p><p>He was one of the founders of the Austrian Geological Society and served as its president in 1856. Haidinger made significant contributions to the field of mineralogy, including the discovery of a mineral called hambergite, as well as the development of a system for classifying minerals based on their chemical composition. In addition to his scientific work, Haidinger was also a prominent public figure in Austria, serving as a member of parliament and as a director of the Imperial Royal Polytechnic Institute in Vienna. He was awarded numerous honors and awards throughout his lifetime, and several minerals were named after him, including haidingerite and haidingeraite.</p><p>Haidinger grew up in a family of scientists and received a rigorous education in science from an early age. He studied mathematics, chemistry, and physics at Vienna University and later became a professor there. He also taught at several other universities in Europe, including the University of Berlin and the University of Prague.</p><p>Haidinger was known for his exceptional organizational skills and his ability to bring people together. In addition to founding the Austrian Geological Society, he played a key role in establishing the International Geographical Congress and the International Geological Congress, two important meetings that brought together scientists from all over the world to discuss the latest research in their fields.</p><p>Haidinger was also a passionate advocate for education and scientific research. He believed that science could help transform society and improve the lives of ordinary people, and he worked tirelessly to promote scientific literacy and public engagement with science.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Haidinger faced significant challenges throughout his life. He struggled with poor health and financial difficulties, and he lived through tumultuous times in Europe, including the revolutions of 1848 and the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. Despite these challenges, he remained committed to his work and continued to make important contributions to the field of mineralogy until his death in 1871.</p><p>Haidinger's contributions to mineralogy were not limited to the field of classification. He was also instrumental in identifying the cause of color in minerals, which had puzzled scientists for centuries. He demonstrated that the presence of certain impurities or chemical elements in a mineral can affect its color, a discovery that led to the development of the science of optical mineralogy - the study of the interactions between light and minerals.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and academic pursuits, Haidinger was also involved in politics. He served as a member of the Austrian Parliament from 1848 to 1849 and was an advocate for liberal reforms, including greater representation for the middle class and broader access to education.</p><p>Haidinger's legacy continues to be felt in the fields of geology, mineralogy, and science education. The mineral haidingerite, which was named in his honor, is still studied by scientists today, and his contributions to the understanding of mineral color and optical properties remain relevant in the modern field of mineralogy.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to science and society, Haidinger was awarded numerous honors and awards throughout his lifetime, including the prestigious Order of Leopold, which was awarded to him in 1860 by the Emperor of Austria.</p><p></p><p>

was
an Austrian
architect.


					</p><p>He is known as the pioneer of modern shopping malls and his designs revolutionized the way people shopped. Gruen's early work was in Vienna where he designed low-cost public housing. However, he fled Austria during the Nazi regime and eventually settled in the United States. In the US, Gruen established his architectural practice and was commissioned to design upscale shopping centers, including the first fully enclosed climate-controlled mall in Edina, Minnesota in 1956. He also designed the Southdale Center in Minnesota, the Kalamazoo Mall in Michigan, and the Northland Center in Michigan, among others. His vision was to create shopping destinations that were more than just places to buy goods, but also social gathering places. Gruen's legacy and impact on modern architecture continue to be felt.</p><p>In addition to his work in retail design, Victor Gruen was also a visionary thinker, with a strong desire to improve quality of life through urban planning. He wrote several books on urban planning, including "The Heart of Our Cities" and "The City Center: The New Pattern for Urban Life". In these books, he argued for the importance of public space, pedestrian-friendly design, and mixed-use developments. He believed that the design of a city could have a profound impact on the happiness and well-being of its inhabitants. </p><p>Despite his success as a designer and urban planner, Gruen ultimately became disillusioned with the commercialization of his ideas. He felt that the malls he had designed had become soulless and alienating spaces, and that they had contributed to the decline of small businesses and the loss of community in America's cities. In his later years, he focused on advocating for a return to more traditional neighborhood-based shopping districts, and for the creation of public spaces that fostered social interaction and community engagement. He passed away in Vienna in 1980, but his ideas continue to inspire architects and urban planners today.</p><p>Gruen was not only involved in architecture but also took part in several international projects. He helped design the city of Krefeld, Germany, and the new center of Fort Worth, Texas. Gruen also worked on a project for the development of new towns in Puerto Rico. Beyond his professional achievements, Gruen was also recognized for his activism and advocacy for social causes. He was a vocal supporter of civil rights and served on the board of the Urban Coalition, an organization that worked to improve living conditions for minorities in American cities. Gruen's legacy is a reminder of the importance of considering the impact of design on communities and the need for a holistic approach to architecture that takes into account social, cultural, economic, and environmental considerations.</p><p></p><p>

physician, writer and screenwriter.


					</p><p>He studied medicine at the University of Innsbruck and started practicing as a physician in Axams. However, he had a passion for literature and soon became involved in the literary circles of Vienna. Schönherr was part of the group of writers known as Jung-Wien (Young Vienna) who were central to the Viennese literary scene at the turn of the 20th century.</p><p>Schönherr wrote plays, novels, and poetry in both German and Tyrolean dialect. His works often dealt with the struggles of the lower and middle classes, and with the tensions between city and rural life. His most famous work is the play "Erde" (Earth) which premiered in 1905 and is considered a classic of Austrian literature. </p><p>In addition to his literary work, Schönherr also worked as a screenwriter in the Austrian film industry. He wrote the scripts for several films including "The Old mill on the Mura" (1910) and "Bozena" (1925). </p><p>Schönherr's influence on Austrian literature and culture was significant, and he is remembered as one of the leading figures of the Jung-Wien movement.</p><p>Schönherr was not only a prolific writer but also an advocate for the preservation of Tyrolean culture and language. He was a member of the Tyrolean Farmers' Union and the Tyrolean Homeland Association, and his works often reflected his love for the Tyrolean Alpine region. Schönherr's dedication to his roots was recognized in 1941 when he was awarded the honorary citizenship of the Tyrolean town of Hall in Tirol. Despite his success in literature and film, Schönherr continued to practice as a physician throughout his life, seeing patients in both Axams and Vienna. He passed away in Vienna in 1943 at the age of 76. Today, his works continue to be studied and celebrated as an important part of Austrian literary and cultural history.</p><p>Schönherr's involvement in politics was also notable. He was a member of the Social Democratic Workers' Party and ran for political office in 1919. Despite losing the election, he remained active in political circles and was known for his leftist views. Schönherr was also a vocal critic of the rising Nazi Party in Austria, and his works were banned by the regime after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. Schönherr's opposition to the Nazis led to his persecution, and he was briefly arrested in 1939. Despite the risks, he continued to express his opposition to the regime through his writing and public statements. Today, he is remembered as a courageous figure who stood up against Nazi oppression.</p><p></p><p>
