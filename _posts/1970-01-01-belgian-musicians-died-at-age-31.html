(April 5, 2015-April 5, 1983)


was
a Belgian
scientist.


					</p><p>He is known for his work in the field of cryogenics, which is the study of materials at very low temperatures. Bacq studied at the Université Libre de Bruxelles and later became a professor there.</p><p>During his career, Bacq made significant contributions to the understanding of superconductivity and the properties of materials at extremely low temperatures. He also developed techniques for the study of biological tissues at low temperatures, which have since been used in the field of organ transplantation.</p><p>Bacq was recognized for his work with numerous honors, including the Francqui Prize and the Rumford Medal. In addition to his contributions to science, he was also known for his love of music and played the cello in his free time.</p><p>After his death in 1983, the Zénon Bacq Prize was established in his honor. This prize is awarded every two years by the Royal Academy of Belgium to young scientists for their contributions to the field of cryogenics.</p><p>In addition to his work in cryogenics, Bacq also made significant contributions to the understanding of the effects of radiation on living organisms. He studied the effects of radiation on plants and animals, and his research helped to establish the field of radiation biology. Bacq was also an advocate for the peaceful use of nuclear energy and served on the Belgian Atomic Energy Commission.</p><p>Bacq was a prolific author, publishing numerous articles and books throughout his career. He was also a passionate teacher and mentor, and many of his students went on to become leading scientists in their fields.</p><p>Outside of his scientific pursuits, Bacq was an avid outdoorsman and enjoyed hiking and camping.

Today, he is remembered as one of the greatest scientists in Belgian history, and his contributions to the fields of cryogenics and radiation biology continue to be studied and celebrated.</p><p>Bacq's research on superconductivity led to the discovery of a phenomenon now known as "Bacq-Delmer oscillations." These oscillations are small, periodic changes in the magnetic field of a superconductor that occur when it is exposed to a high magnetic field.His work on the properties of materials at low temperatures also led to the development of new technologies, including the MRI machine, which uses the magnetic properties of atoms to produce detailed images of organs and tissues.Bacq's research on radiation biology was instrumental in the development of radiation therapy for cancer treatment.In addition to his scientific accomplishments, Bacq was a strong advocate for international cooperation in science and was involved in establishing scientific exchange programs between Belgium and other countries.</p><p></p><p>

(February 23, 1872-June 19, 1903			Brussels)


was
a Belgian
personality.


					
			
		She had
		one
		child,
		Marguerite Yourcenar.

						</p><p>Fernande de Cartier de Marchienne was born to a wealthy, aristocratic family in Brussels, Belgium. She grew up in luxury and, at the age of 20, married Michel Cleenewerck de Crayencour, a young lawyer and writer. However, their marriage deteriorated quickly due to Michel's infidelity, and Fernande left him and moved to Paris with their daughter, Marguerite.</p><p>In Paris, Fernande became a muse to many artists and writers, including the famous novelist, Henry James. She had numerous affairs and was known for her beauty and charm. However, her lifestyle took a toll on her health, and she died in Brussels at the age of 31.</p><p>Despite her short life, Fernande's impact on the arts and literature cannot be denied. Her daughter, Marguerite Yourcenar, went on to become a critically acclaimed writer and the first woman to be elected to the Académie française. Today, Fernande is remembered as an important figure in the cultural scene of fin-de-siècle Europe.</p><p>Fernande's time in Paris was marked by her involvement in various artistic and literary circles. She was a model for several well-known painters of the time, such as Georges Seurat and Édouard Vuillard. Her beauty and charm inspired many writers, including André Gide, who dedicated his novel "The Immoralist" to her. Fernande also had a close relationship with Rainer Maria Rilke, who wrote several poems about her. Despite her numerous affairs, Fernande remained close with her daughter Marguerite and provided her with a strong education in literature and the arts. Marguerite would go on to become one of the most important writers of the 20th century, with her masterpiece novel "Memoirs of Hadrian" considered a classic of French literature. Today, Fernande's legacy lives on not just through her daughter's work, but also through many of the artists and writers she inspired during her short but influential life.</p><p>Fernande de Cartier de Marchienne's legacy is not just limited to her cultural contributions. She was also an advocate for women's rights and championed causes related to education and healthcare. Fernande helped found a nursing school in Brussels and supported women's suffrage movements. Her activism and philanthropy were ahead of her time and helped set a precedent for future generations of women.</p><p>In addition to her impact on the arts and her advocacy work, Fernande's personal life was also significant. Her tumultuous relationship with her husband, Michel Cleenewerck de Crayencour, inspired Marguerite Yourcenar's novel "A Coin in Nine Hands". Fernande's own memoirs, "Souvenirs pieux d'une fille rangée" (Pious Memories of a Respectable Girl), were published posthumously and offer a glimpse into her life and relationships.</p><p>Overall, Fernande de Cartier de Marchienne's influence reached far beyond her short life. She inspired artists and writers, fought for social causes, and raised a daughter who went on to achieve great literary success. Her legacy continues to be celebrated and studied today.</p><p></p><p>
