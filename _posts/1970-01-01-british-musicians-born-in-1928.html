(September 5, 1928		London-June 29, 2006			Cambridge)


was
a British
pianist.


						</p><p>She began her piano studies at a young age and made her debut as a soloist at the age of 12 with the New Queens Hall Orchestra. Hatto went on to perform extensively throughout Europe and earned a reputation as a skilled interpreter of the Romantic repertoire. However, her career was cut short due to health issues.</p><p>In the 1970s, Hatto turned her attention to the recording studio and started releasing albums on her own label. Despite receiving critical acclaim, her recordings did not gain widespread recognition until after her death. In 2007, it was revealed that some of Hatto's recordings were actually the work of other pianists, leading to a controversy dubbed "Hattogate." Despite this scandal, Hatto's legacy as a pianist and recording artist remains significant.</p><p>Hatto was married to fellow musician William Barrington-Coupe, who also served as her recording producer. Following her death, Barrington-Coupe claimed that Hatto had completed a staggering 119 CDs in the final years of her life, an assertion that was met with skepticism by some members of the classical music community. In the aftermath of the controversy, it was discovered that Barrington-Coupe had in fact doctored some of Hatto's recordings by copying segments from other pianists and splicing them together. Despite the deception, many listeners still appreciate Hatto's authentic, unaltered recordings and her contributions to the world of classical music.</p><p></p><p>
