											</h1><p>Here are 30 famous musicians from Canada were born in 1955:</p><h2>John Kricfalusi</h2><p><strong>John Kricfalusi</strong>
(September 9, 1955		Chicoutimi-)

	
		also known as Michael John Kricfalusi, John K., Raymond Spum, John Krisfaloosy, Raymond S. or Raymond Spüm

	
is
a Canadian
animator, voice actor, television director, television producer, screenwriter and actor.


						</p><p>He is best known as the creator of the animated television series "The Ren & Stimpy Show". Kricfalusi began his career in animation as a layout artist before eventually becoming a director and creating his own cartoons. In addition to "The Ren & Stimpy Show", Kricfalusi has worked on other animated series such as "The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse", "The Jetsons", and "The Simpsons". He has also directed several music videos and advertisements. Despite his success, Kricfalusi has been the subject of controversy due to his behavior towards staff members and his involvement in several legal disputes.</p><p>Kricfalusi was born in Canada but spent most of his childhood in Germany and Belgium due to his father's job as a salesman. He moved to Los Angeles in the late 1970s to pursue a career in animation and landed a job at Filmation Studios. However, he left the studio after becoming disillusioned with the company's creative restrictions. It was during this period that Kricfalusi began experimenting with his own style of animation, which would later become the hallmark of "The Ren & Stimpy Show".</p><p>Despite the success of "The Ren & Stimpy Show", Kricfalusi's career suffered a setback in the late 1990s when he was fired from the show due to creative differences with Nickelodeon. He went on to create several other animated series, including "The Ripping Friends" and "Ren & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon", but none of them matched the success of his earlier work.</p><p>In recent years, Kricfalusi has largely stayed out of the public eye and has focused on his personal life. However, in 2018, he was accused of sexual misconduct by several women who worked with him on "The Ren & Stimpy Show". Kricfalusi issued a public apology for his behavior and is reportedly seeking therapy.</p><p>Kricfalusi's unique animation style in "The Ren & Stimpy Show" garnered him praise from critics and fans alike, with some even calling him a genius in the field. He frequently incorporated stylized close-ups, extreme close-ups, and exaggerated facial expressions in his work, which showcased his mastery of traditional animation techniques.</p><p>Despite his controversial reputation, Kricfalusi's influence on the animation industry is undeniable. Many animators and cartoonists credit him as an inspiration and have adopted elements of his style in their own work. In addition, he has been recognized with several awards for his contributions to the field, including two Primetime Emmy nominations for directing "The Ren & Stimpy Show".</p><p>In his spare time, Kricfalusi is a collector of vintage animation art and has amassed an impressive collection of artwork and memorabilia. He also teaches animation and has mentored several aspiring animators throughout his career.</p><p>Despite the scandals and setbacks, Kricfalusi remains a prolific figure in the animation industry, and his contributions to the art form will continue to inspire future generations of animators.</p><p></p><p>

In 2000, Smith unfortunately passed away in a drowning accident while on vacation in California. His contributions to the music industry have been widely recognized, and he is remembered as a talented and respected musician.</p><p>Smith was born and raised in Winnipeg, Canada, and began playing bass in his teenage years.

His work with Loverboy propelled him to international stardom, and he toured extensively with the band throughout the 1980s.

His legacy continues to influence musicians around the world, and he is remembered as a kind and talented individual who left a lasting impact on the music industry.</p><p>Smith's influence on the music industry can be seen in the way he approached playing the bass. He was known for his unique style, which combined melodic playing with driving rhythms. His innovative approach to the bass was particularly notable in his work with Loverboy, where he added a distinctive edge to the band's sound. Smith's work with the band helped to define the arena rock sound of the 1980s, and his influence can still be heard in the music of many contemporary rock bands.</p><p>Despite his success with Loverboy and other bands, Smith remained dedicated to his craft and continued to work on new music throughout his life. He was known for his perfectionism in the studio and was constantly seeking to improve his playing and songwriting abilities.</p><p>Smith's tragic passing in 2000 was a shock to the music world and left many fans and fellow musicians reeling. In the wake of his death, there was an outpouring of tributes from his peers, who praised him for his talent, kindness, and dedication to the music he loved.</p><p>In addition to his induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the British Columbia Entertainment Hall of Fame, Smith's legacy continues to be celebrated through an annual music festival in his honor. The Scott Smith Scholarship Fund, which supports aspiring musicians, was also established in his memory.</p><p></p><p>
