He was also a professor of archaeology at the University of Athens and director of the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. Marinatos' contributions to the field of archaeology earned him numerous accolades, including the Gold Medal of the Archaeological Society of Athens and election to the Academy of Athens. He tragically died while excavating at the site of Santorini, when he was hit by a falling rock.</p><p>Marinatos was born into a prominent family with a long history of political and intellectual involvement in Greece. He graduated from the University of Athens in 1924 and then spent several years working as an archaeologist on various excavations throughout Greece. In the early 1930s, he began to focus his attention on the island of Crete and the Minoan civilization that had flourished there.</p><p>One of Marinatos' most significant contributions to the study of archaeology was his theory that the eruption of the Thera volcano, which destroyed the city of Akrotiri, was the inspiration behind the myth of Atlantis. Marinatos proposed that the Minoan civilization on Thera was the basis for Plato's account of Atlantis, which has been the subject of much debate among scholars and archaeologists.</p><p>In addition to his work at Akrotiri, Marinatos also conducted excavations at the ancient city of Mycenae and on the islands of Kea and Keos. He was a prolific writer and published numerous articles and books on his archaeological findings and theories.</p><p>Marinatos' tragic death in 1974 was a great loss to the field of archaeology. However, his work continues to inspire and inform scholars around the world, and his legacy remains an important part of the study of the ancient Mediterranean world.</p><p>Marinatos' work on the excavation of Akrotiri was groundbreaking in its approach to preservation. He utilized a process of "archaeological cladistics" in which he analyzed individual objects in the excavation site and traced their evolutionary development over time. This allowed him to reconstruct the layout of the entire city and gain insights into the daily life of its inhabitants.</p><p>Marinatos was also a political figure in Greece and served briefly as Minister of Culture in 1972. He was a vocal advocate for the preservation of Greece's historical and cultural heritage and played a key role in the establishment of the Ephorate (Department) of Underwater Antiquities, which is tasked with the preservation of Greece's underwater archaeological resources.</p><p>In addition to his academic pursuits, Marinatos was also an accomplished athlete, having represented Greece in the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam as a member of the water polo team. He was also an accomplished painter and frequently incorporated his artistic talents into his professional work, creating detailed sketches and illustrations of his archaeological findings.</p><p></p><p>
