Getty III gained notoriety in 1973 when he was kidnapped in Rome at the age of 16 by a group of criminals who demanded a ransom of $17 million ($100 million today) from his grandfather. Despite the elder Getty's immense wealth, he initially refused to pay the ransom, which resulted in Getty III being held captive for several months during which his captors mutilated him.
