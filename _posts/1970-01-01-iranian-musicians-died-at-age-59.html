(April 1, 1919		Birjand-April 14, 1978			New York City)


was
an Iranian
politician.


					</p><p>He was the chief of staff to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, from 1962 to 1964 and again from 1966 to 1977. Alam was a key figure in Iran's "White Revolution," which aimed to modernize the country and reduce the influence of the clergy. He served in various ministerial positions, including minister of court, minister of labor, and minister of agriculture, and was known for his pragmatic approach and ability to get things done. However, he also had powerful enemies, who accused him of corruption and other crimes. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Alam fled to the United States, where he died of a heart attack.</p><p>Alam was born into a well-respected family in Birjand, located in eastern Iran. He received his early education in Tehran and later attended the University of Paris, where he earned a degree in law. Alam was known for his charm and intelligence, which allowed him to easily form alliances and gain the trust of the Shah.</p><p>During his time as chief of staff, Alam played a key role in implementing many of the Shah's reforms, including land reform and women's suffrage. He was also instrumental in strengthening ties with the United States, which placed Iran firmly in the Western camp during the Cold War. However, Alam's close association with the Shah ultimately proved to be his downfall, as many Iranians grew increasingly critical of the monarch and his regime.</p><p>After fleeing Iran, Alam settled in New York City, where he lived until his death in 1978. He was survived by his wife, Farideh Diba, and their two children. Although he remains a controversial figure in Iranian history, many Iranians continue to acknowledge his contributions to the country's modernization and development.</p><p>Alam became a member of the Iranian parliament in 1952 and was re-elected several times. He was known for his support of democracy and his opposition to the growing power of the religious establishment. However, his views were not always popular, and he faced assassination attempts and other forms of opposition from his political rivals.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Alam was also a successful businessman. He owned several large companies, including Iran National Airlines, and was one of Iran's wealthiest men. His business interests, combined with his political power, made him a feared and controversial figure in Iranian society.</p><p>Despite his controversial reputation, Alam was widely respected for his intelligence, his political acumen, and his ability to get things done. He was also known for his love of Iranian culture and his support of the country's artists, writers, and musicians.</p><p>Today, Alam is remembered as a key figure in the history of modern Iran. Although his legacy is complicated by his association with the Shah and his regime, he is widely acknowledged as a skilled and effective politician who played an important role in shaping the future of his country.</p><p></p><p>
