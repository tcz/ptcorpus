(December 29, 1903		Großrückerswalde-December 11, 1982)


was
a German
musician.


						</p><p>He was primarily known as a composer and conductor, and is widely regarded as one of the most influential choral musicians of the 20th century. Mauersberger began his musical training at a young age, and went on to study at the Dresden Conservatory. He served as the conductor of the famous Dresdner Kreuzchor, a boys' choir, from 1930 to 1961. During his tenure, he led the group on several successful tours around the world, performing in venues such as the Vatican and the White House. </p><p>Besides his choral work, Mauersberger also composed a number of works for solo voice, organ, and orchestra. His music was strongly influenced by the traditions of the Lutheran Church, and he often incorporated texts from Christian scripture and liturgy into his compositions. Despite being a major figure in the cultural life of East Germany, Mauersberger was never a member of the ruling communist party. After his retirement from the Dresdner Kreuzchor, he continued to compose and conduct until his death in 1982.</p><p>Mauersberger's most famous work is perhaps his motet "Wie liegt die Stadt so wüst," which was inspired by the destruction of Dresden during World War II. The composition was written for the choir of the Dresden Frauenkirche, which had been destroyed in the bombing. Mauersberger was intimately involved in the reconstruction of the church, and conducted its first service in 1955. He also wrote a requiem for the victims of the bombings, entitled "Dresdner Requiem," which premiered in 1949. In addition to his musical accomplishments, Mauersberger was also a respected academic, and held professorships at several German conservatories. He was honored with numerous awards and distinctions during his lifetime, including the National Prize of East Germany.</p><p></p><p>
