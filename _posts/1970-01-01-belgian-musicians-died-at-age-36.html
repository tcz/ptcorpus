(April 5, 1898		Brussels-May 1, 1934			Lausanne)

	
		a.k.a. John Daumery

	
was
a Belgian
film director.


					</p><p>He is credited with directing several films, including "Un Chant d'Amour" (A Song of Love) in 1930, which was a controversial film for its time due to its depiction of homosexuality. Daumery was known for his experimental style and use of avant-garde techniques in filmmaking. He sadly passed away at the young age of 36 due to complications from tuberculosis. Despite his short career, Daumery's influence on the film industry and his contributions to experimental filmmaking continue to be recognized and celebrated today.</p><p>Daumery was a self-taught filmmaker who began his career working for the French film company, Pathé. His first film, "Le Pèlerinage" (The Pilgrimage), was released in 1928 and garnered critical acclaim. In addition to his work as a director, Daumery was also a screenwriter, and he collaborated with several prominent artists of his time, including Salvador Dalí and Luis Buñuel. </p><p>Daumery's films were characterized by their use of symbolism, dreamlike imagery, and unconventional editing techniques. His films often explored themes of sexuality, gender, and human emotion in complex and abstract ways. "Un Chant d'Amour" was particularly controversial at the time of its release due to its frank depiction of homoeroticism, which was considered taboo in the 1930s. </p><p>Despite his avant-garde style and critical acclaim, Daumery struggled to find commercial success, and many of his films went unseen by mainstream audiences. His premature death was a tragic loss to the film community, but his legacy lives on as his work continues to inspire and influence independent filmmakers around the world.</p><p>In addition to his work in film, Daumery was also a poet and an active member of several literary and artistic circles in Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. He was known for his friendships with other prominent artists and thinkers of his time, including the poet René Char and the philosopher Georges Bataille. Daumery also wrote essays on film theory and aesthetics, and his ideas on the potential of cinema as an art form were considered visionary for their time. Despite his relatively short career, Daumery's impact on the avant-garde film movement of the early 20th century cannot be overstated. His innovative techniques and bold explorations of taboo subjects continue to inspire filmmakers today, and his work remains a testament to the power of art to challenge societal norms and push boundaries.</p><p></p><p>
