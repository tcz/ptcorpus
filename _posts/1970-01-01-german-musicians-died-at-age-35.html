(April 21, 1488		Hesse-August 29, 1523			Ufenau)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a scholar, poet, and reformer who played a significant role in the Protestant Reformation. Hutten was also known for his uncompromising criticism of the Roman Catholic Church, the Holy Roman Empire, and the German nobility, which made him a controversial figure in his time. He was a close friend and ally of Martin Luther and helped spread Luther's ideas throughout Germany. Hutten's works were widely read and inspired many to seek a more just and equitable society. He died at the age of 35 on the shores of Lake Zurich, while in exile from his homeland. Despite his relatively short life, Hutten left a lasting legacy as one of the most important figures of the German Renaissance.</p><p>Hutten was born into a noble family and received a classical education in Latin and Greek. He became proficient in several languages, including Hebrew and Arabic, and traveled extensively throughout Europe, where he made many influential connections in intellectual and political circles. Hutten's views on religious reform were heavily influenced by his experiences, and he became a vocal advocate for the separation of church and state.</p><p>Hutten's writings were both prophetic and polemical, and his sharp wit and incisive critiques earned him many enemies. He was excommunicated by the Catholic Church and denounced by many of his peers, including the humanist Erasmus, whom he had once admired. While Hutten's commitment to religious and political reform was unwavering, his personal life was marked by controversy and scandal, including accusations of adultery and drunkenness.</p><p>Despite the setbacks and personal turmoil, Hutten remained focused on his mission until his death. His legacy as a writer and social critic was cemented by the publication of his collected works in the 16th century, which included some of his most famous and influential essays, letters, and dialogues. Today, Hutten is remembered as a symbol of the intellectual and political ferment of the early modern period and as a champion of the humanist values that continue to shape our world today.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to the Protestant Reformation, Ulrich von Hutten was also known as a skilled swordsman and participated in several duels. He even wrote a book on fencing techniques. Hutten was forced into exile multiple times throughout his life due to his controversial views and political allegiances. He spent time in Switzerland, Austria, and Hungary, among other places.</p><p>Hutten's writing was not limited to religious and political topics. He also wrote poetry and plays, using his talents to entertain and to spread his ideas. One of his best-known works is the play "Der Stirner," a satirical portrayal of a greedy and hypocritical pope.</p><p>Despite his flaws and controversies, Hutten's legacy influenced many important figures throughout history. In the 19th century, German nationalists saw Hutten as a hero and model for their own struggles for independence and unification. Friedrich Nietzsche also admired Hutten's courage and individualism, calling him "a free spirit" and "a perfect knight." Today, Hutten's legacy lives on as a reminder of the power of ideas and the importance of speaking truth to power.</p><p></p><p>

(October 8, 1890		Germany-September 5, 1926)


was
a German
journalist and politician.


					</p><p>He is known for being one of the founding members of the Nazi Party in 1919 and for his role in the early development of the party's ideologies. Harrer was also active in various right-wing organizations before joining the Nazi Party, including the Thule Society. However, he left the party in 1920 due to disagreements with Adolf Hitler and went on to become a member of the Bavarian parliament. Harrer was later arrested and imprisoned for his involvement in the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 but was released in 1924 due to ill health. He died in Munich two years later at the age of 35.</p><p>After leaving the Nazi Party, Harrer went on to become a member of the German National People's Party and later the Bavarian parliament. Despite his departure from the Nazi Party, he remained an influential figure in the far-right political scene and continued to promote nationalist and anti-Semitic views. He also briefly served as the editor of the newspaper "Völkischer Beobachter," which would later become the official Nazi Party newspaper under Hitler's leadership.</p><p>Harrer's involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch, a failed attempt by Hitler to seize power in Munich, led to his arrest and imprisonment in Landsberg Prison. While in prison, he wrote articles denouncing the Nazi Party and its leader. However, he continued to support far-right ideologies and remained a controversial figure in German politics.</p><p>Despite his relatively short life, Harrer played an important role in the early development of the Nazi Party and its ideologies. His legacy is a reminder of the dangers of extremist ideologies and the need to remain vigilant against their resurgence.</p><p>Harrer was born in Würzburg, Germany and grew up in Munich. After finishing school, he studied law and became a journalist. He worked for a variety of newspapers and magazines, including the anti-Semitic publication "Auf gut Deutsch," which helped him develop his nationalist and anti-Semitic beliefs. In 1918, Harrer joined the Thule Society, a secretive organization that promoted extreme nationalism and claimed to have occult knowledge. He quickly became an influential member of the society and used his connections to promote far-right ideas.</p><p>In 1919, Harrer helped to establish the German Workers' Party (DAP), which would later become the Nazi Party. He was the party's first chairman and played a key role in developing its early political platform. Harrer and other early members of the party believed in a form of extreme nationalism that emphasized the superiority of the German "race" and the need to eliminate perceived threats to the nation, including Jews, communists, and other groups.</p><p>Despite his initial enthusiasm for the Nazi Party, Harrer soon became disillusioned with Hitler and his leadership style. He disagreed with Hitler's authoritarian approach and his tendency to resort to violence to achieve political goals. In 1920, Harrer left the party and joined the German National People's Party, which was also a far-right nationalist group.</p><p>After the Beer Hall Putsch, Harrer was arrested and imprisoned along with other Nazi leaders. He was released in 1924 due to ill health and went on to write articles denouncing Hitler and the Nazi Party. However, he continued to promote far-right ideologies and remained involved in politics until his death in 1926.</p><p>Today, Harrer is remembered as one of the earliest and most influential members of the Nazi Party. His writings and actions helped to lay the foundation for the party's political platform and his departure from the party signaled a turning point in its history. However, his legacy is also a reminder of the dangers of extremism and the importance of remaining vigilant against the rise of extremist ideologies.</p><p></p><p>

(February 18, 1904		Michelstadt-March 13, 1939			Tyrol)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Rahn was a writer and a researcher with a strong interest in the Holy Grail and Catharism. He is best-known for his books, including "Crusade Against the Grail" and "Lucifer's Court." Rahn's work has been the subject of much controversy and speculation, and he is often associated with occult and Nazi themes. He was a member of the SS during World War II, and some historians believe that he was involved in occult research for the Nazi regime. Despite his controversial legacy, Rahn continues to captivate the imaginations of those with an interest in mysticism, religious history, and esotericism.</p><p>Otto Rahn was born into a Lutheran family, and he developed a passion for medieval history and literature from a young age. He studied philology and history at the University of Giessen, where he was influenced by the teachings of the historian and scholar Hermann Degering. Rahn's interest in the Cathars, a Christian sect that flourished in Southern France in the 12th and 13th centuries, led him to conduct extensive research and even to travel to the region to study the ruins of the Cathar castles.</p><p>In his book "Crusade Against the Grail," Rahn argued that the Cathars held secret knowledge about the Holy Grail, a legendary vessel that was believed to have held the blood of Jesus Christ. Rahn believed that the Grail was a symbol of spiritual enlightenment and that the Cathars possessed the key to unlocking its mysteries. His work attracted the attention of Himmler, who was interested in the occult and the possibility that the Nazis could use ancient mystical knowledge to gain power.</p><p>Rahn's time in the SS was a controversial period in his life, as some believe that he was disillusioned with the Nazi regime and had become a liability. He was demoted and faced persecution for his homosexuality, which was considered a criminal offense at the time. Rahn died in the Tyrolean Mountains in 1939, under circumstances that remain unclear. Despite the controversy surrounding his life and work, Rahn's writings continue to inspire and intrigue people who are fascinated with the mysteries of the past.</p><p>After Rahn's death, some of his unpublished works were lost, leading to speculation about what other knowledge he may have had. His work on Catharism, the Holy Grail, and other mystical topics continues to have a dedicated following among scholars of esotericism and alternative history. Rahn's legacy has been further complicated by his association with the Nazi regime, which has led some to question his motives and his beliefs. However, others argue that Rahn was an independent thinker and researcher who was simply caught up in the political and social turmoil of his time.</p><p>In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Rahn's life and work, with new books and documentaries exploring his theories and his impact on the field of esotericism. Some have even suggested that Rahn's research into the Cathars and the Grail could have inspired the plot of Dan Brown's best-selling novel "The Da Vinci Code." Despite the controversies surrounding his life and death, Otto Rahn remains a fascinating and enigmatic figure who continues to capture the imagination of those interested in the mysteries of history and the occult.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in suicide.

(November 24, 1909		Greifswald-August 4, 1945			Prague)


was
a German
mathematician.


					</p><p>Gentzen is best known for his contributions to mathematical logic, particularly his work in proof theory. He is famous for developing the "Gentzen's proof system," which revolutionized the field of mathematical proof theory by introducing natural deduction and the sequent calculus. Gentzen was also a pioneer in the field of ordinal analysis, a branch of proof theory that studies the proof-theoretic strength of mathematical theories through their ordinal rankings. Unfortunately, his promising career was cut short due to his involvement in World War II, and he tragically died at a young age in a suicide bombing in Prague in 1945. Despite his early death, Gentzen's work continues to have a profound impact on the field of mathematical logic to this day.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to mathematical logic, Gentzen was also interested in philosophy and physics. He studied at the University of Göttingen under renowned mathematicians such as David Hilbert and Hermann Weyl. During his time as a student, he became involved with the German Communist Party and began attending meetings of leftist student groups. After completing his Ph.D. in 1933, Gentzen struggled to find academic positions due to his political beliefs and the political climate in Germany at the time. He eventually found work as a mathematics teacher in Dresden, where he continued to work on his research.</p><p>During World War II, Gentzen was drafted into the German army, where he worked as a codebreaker. He also continued to work on his research, even while serving in the military. In 1945, he was stationed in Prague, where he was killed in a bombing by the Czech resistance. Gentzen's work continues to be influential in mathematical logic, and he is remembered as one of the most important logicians of the 20th century. Despite his short life, his legacy endures in the work of the many mathematicians who have followed in his footsteps.</p><p>Despite his short and tragic life, Gentzen left a lasting legacy through his contributions to mathematical logic. In addition to his work on proof theory and ordinal analysis, he also made significant contributions to the field of intuitionistic logic. He developed what is now known as the "Gentzen translation," which translates formulas in intuitionistic logic into formulas in classical logic. This translation allows mathematicians to apply the tools of classical logic to intuitionistic logic, making it easier to study.</p><p>Gentzen's work has also had an impact on computer science, particularly in the area of automated theorem proving. His natural deduction system and sequent calculus have been adapted for use in automated theorem provers, programs that can automatically and efficiently prove mathematical theorems using logical deduction.</p><p>Gentzen's life and work have been the subject of numerous books, papers, and conferences. In 2018, a collection of his manuscripts and correspondence was published, shedding new light on his thinking and his development as a mathematician. Today, Gentzen is remembered not only for his groundbreaking contributions to mathematical logic, but also for his dedication to his research, even in the face of political turmoil and war.</p><p></p><p>
