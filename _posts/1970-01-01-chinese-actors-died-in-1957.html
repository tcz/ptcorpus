							Shi Hui began his career in the film industry in the 1920s as an actor, but eventually transitioned to directing. He is best known for his work in the 1930s, during which he directed several successful films, including "Zhongshan Goes to America" (1934) and "Noble Lady" (1936). Shi was considered to be one of the pioneers of Chinese film and contributed greatly to its development during this early period.</p><p>In addition to his work in film, Shi was also a talented writer and playwright. He was a member of the Shanghai School of Literature, which was a group of writers and intellectuals who were active in the 1920s and 1930s. Shi's literary works often drew inspiration from the social issues of his time, and he used his platform to advocate for social change.</p><p>Unfortunately, Shi's career was cut short by the Japanese occupation of China in the 1940s. He continued to work in the film industry during this time, but was limited in his ability to create films that were critical of the Japanese government. Shi passed away in 1957, but his legacy as a prominent figure in Chinese film history lives on.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=23554809" title="Wikipedia article about Shi Hui">Shi Hui on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/filipino-actors-died-at-age-24.html' title='Filipino actors died at age 24'><strong>Filipino actors died at age 24</strong> List of the top 2 Filipino actors who died when they were 24</a></li><li><a href='/argentine-actors-died-before-turning-21.html' title='Argentine actors died before turning 21'><strong>Argentine actors died before turning 21</strong> List of the top 8 Argentine actors who died before they turned 21</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-musicians-died-in-cancer.html' title='Canadian musicians died in Cancer'><strong>Canadian musicians died in Cancer</strong> List of the top 26 Canadian music stars who died in Cancer</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-1993.html' title='Famous actors died in 1993'><strong>Famous actors died in 1993</strong> List of the top 50 Famous actors who died in 1993</a></li><li><a href='/italian-actors-died-in-respiratory-disease.html' title='Italian actors died in Respiratory disease'><strong>Italian actors died in Respiratory disease</strong> List of the top 2 Italian actors who died in Respiratory disease</a></li><li><a href='/chinese-musicians-died-at-age-42.html' title='Chinese musicians died at age 42'><strong>Chinese musicians died at age 42</strong> List of the top 3 Chinese music stars who died when they were 42</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
