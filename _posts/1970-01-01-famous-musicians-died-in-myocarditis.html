						Vives was a prominent figure in the Spanish musical scene in the early 20th century. He began his career as a piano accompanist and composer of art songs, gaining recognition for his particularly melodic and expressive style. However, it was in the genre of zarzuela, a form of musical theater popular in Spain, where Vives found his greatest success. He wrote over 30 zarzuelas, many of which are still performed today, such as "Doña Francisquita" and "Bohemios."</p><p>In addition to his work as a composer, Vives was also a prolific writer, penning the librettos for many of his own zarzuelas. He even tried his hand at directing, founding his own company, the Teatro de la Zarzuela, in Madrid. This venture proved successful, with the theater becoming a hub for zarzuela performances and premieres.</p><p>Despite his achievements, Vives faced setbacks in his personal life, including the loss of his wife and the onset of deafness in his later years. Nevertheless, his contributions to Spanish music and theater are widely celebrated, with streets and schools named after him in several cities across Spain.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=7567553" title="Wikipedia article about Amadeu Vives i Roig">Amadeu Vives i Roig on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/british-actors-died-in-renal-failure.html' title='British actors died in Renal failure'><strong>British actors died in Renal failure</strong> List of the top 5 British actors who died in Renal failure</a></li><li><a href='/mexican-actors-died-at-age-72.html' title='Mexican actors died at age 72'><strong>Mexican actors died at age 72</strong> List of the top 6 Mexican actors who died when they were 72</a></li><li><a href='/swedish-actors-died-in-1966.html' title='Swedish actors died in 1966'><strong>Swedish actors died in 1966</strong> List of the top 2 Swedish actors who died in 1966</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/australian-actresses-died-in-adrenal-cancer.html' title='Australian actresses died in Adrenal cancer'><strong>Australian actresses died in Adrenal cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Australian actresses who died in Adrenal cancer</a></li><li><a href='/argentine-actors-died-at-age-73.html' title='Argentine actors died at age 73'><strong>Argentine actors died at age 73</strong> List of the top 3 Argentine actors who died when they were 73</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-circulatory-collapse.html' title='Famous musicians died in Circulatory collapse'><strong>Famous musicians died in Circulatory collapse</strong> List of the top 1 Famous music stars who died in Circulatory collapse</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
