He appeared in popular films such as "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse", "Blood and Sand", and "The Son of the Sheik". He was one of the highest-paid actors of his time and was considered a matinee idol. Valentino was also a trained dancer and often incorporated dance into his film roles. He was married twice, first to actress Jean Acker and then to Natacha Rambova, a costume and set designer. Despite his success on-screen, Valentino faced discrimination and bullying due to his immigrant background and effeminate appearance. His untimely death at the age of 31 sparked widespread public mourning and resulted in numerous conspiracy theories about the cause of his sudden illness.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=45396" title="Wikipedia article about Rudolph Valentino">Rudolph Valentino on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Ermanno Randi</h2><p><strong>Ermanno Randi</strong>
