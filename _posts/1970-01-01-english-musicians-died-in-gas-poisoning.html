						Peter Warlock was an English composer and music critic who lived in the early 20th century. He was a prolific composer of songs and instrumental music, and his work was heavily influenced by English folk music. Warlock was also a talented writer, and he contributed to several publications throughout his career. In addition, he was known as a scholar on the subject of early music, particularly the works of the Italian composer Gesualdo. Unfortunately, Warlock struggled with alcoholism and depression throughout his life, and he ultimately committed suicide at the age of 36. Despite his short life, Warlock left behind a significant body of work that continues to be admired for its originality and beauty.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=296246" title="Wikipedia article about Peter Warlock">Peter Warlock on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/austrian-actors-died-in-1995.html' title='Austrian actors died in 1995'><strong>Austrian actors died in 1995</strong> List of the top 3 Austrian actors who died in 1995</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-actresses-died-in-1971.html' title='Austrian actresses died in 1971'><strong>Austrian actresses died in 1971</strong> List of the top 4 Austrian actresses who died in 1971</a></li><li><a href='/lithuanian-musicians-died-at-age-75.html' title='Lithuanian musicians died at age 75'><strong>Lithuanian musicians died at age 75</strong> List of the top 3 Lithuanian music stars who died when they were 75</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/singaporean-musicians-died-before-turning-40.html' title='Singaporean musicians died before turning 40'><strong>Singaporean musicians died before turning 40</strong> List of the top 10 Singaporean music stars who died before 40</a></li><li><a href='/belgian-actresses-died-in-1988.html' title='Belgian actresses died in 1988'><strong>Belgian actresses died in 1988</strong> List of the top 1 Belgian actresses who died in 1988</a></li><li><a href='/israeli-musicians-died-at-age-29.html' title='Israeli musicians died at age 29'><strong>Israeli musicians died at age 29</strong> List of the top 1 Israeli music stars who died when they were 29</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
