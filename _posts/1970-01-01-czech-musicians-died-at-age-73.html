(May 6, 1879		Lysá nad Labem-December 12, 1952			Prague)

	
		otherwise known as Bedrich Hrozny

	
was
a Czech
personality.


					</p><p>He was a professor, linguist, and archaeologist who made significant contributions to the fields of Hittitology and Assyriology. He is best known for deciphering the Hittite language, an ancient Anatolian language that was once thought to be an isolate. His work on this language was groundbreaking, and he helped shed light on the history and culture of the Hittite civilization. Throughout his career, he made numerous discoveries, including the identification of the Hittite god known as Teshub. In addition to his linguistic and archaeological work, Hrozný was also involved in politics, serving as a member of the Czech parliament from 1929 to 1939. Despite being interned during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, he continued to work on his research until his death in 1952.</p><p>Hrozný initially studied classical philology at Charles University in Prague, but soon turned his attention to Semitic philology and Assyriology. He obtained his doctorate in 1906 and subsequently worked at the University of Vienna, where he made his groundbreaking discovery of the Hittite language. Hrozný deciphered the language by comparing it to Old Armenian, which had retained some of the grammatical features of the ancient language. He published his findings in a seminal work in 1915, which established the Hittite language as a member of the Indo-European family.</p><p>Hrozný's work on Hittite opened up new avenues of research for archaeologists, enabling them to delve deeper into the civilization's history and culture. Hrozný himself carried out several expeditions to the Hittite capital of Hattusa, unearthing numerous artifacts and inscriptions. He also made important contributions to the study of other ancient Near Eastern languages, such as Akkadian and Ugaritic.</p><p>In addition to his academic work, Hrozný was a passionate advocate for Czech independence and democracy. He was a member of the Czechoslovak National Council during World War I and was instrumental in securing Allied support for an independent Czechoslovakia. He also helped establish the Czechoslovak Institute in Paris, which served as a center for the study of Czech language and culture.</p><p>Following the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, Hrozný was arrested and interned in a concentration camp. Despite this, he continued to work on his research, using his knowledge of archaeology and linguistics to help fellow prisoners decipher ancient inscriptions. He was released in 1945 and resumed his academic career until his death in 1952. Today, Hrozný is recognized as one of the greatest scholars of Hittitology and an important figure in Czech cultural and political history.</p><p>During his lifetime, Hrozný was honored with various accolades for his contributions to Hittitology and Assyriology. In 1917, he became a professor at Charles University in Prague, where he taught until 1952. He also served as the director of the Oriental Institute from 1924 to 1945. Hrozný published many works during his career, including "The Hittite Language and the Indo-European Problem" and "Hittite Etymological Dictionary". Apart from being a scholar, he was also a polyglot who knew several languages, including English, French, German, and Russian.</p><p>Hrozný's legacy continues to influence academics and archaeologists around the world. His discovery of the Hittite language was a landmark achievement in the field of linguistics, and his work on the decipherment of ancient inscriptions has shed light on the cultures and societies of the ancient Near East. He remains a significant figure in the history of Czechoslovakia, both for his contributions to academia and his political activism.</p><p></p><p>

His ideas on the nature of language and thought found echoes in the later works of philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and Martin Heidegger, while his literary style and satirical wit inspired writers such as Franz Kafka and Robert Musil. Mauthner's legacy remains a subject of ongoing interest and research in the fields of linguistics, philosophy, and literary studies.</p><p>In addition to his major work on language, Mauthner was also a prolific satirist and novelist. He published several satires on Austrian society, including "Nach berühmten Mustern" ("After Famous Models"), "Brettlbriefe" ("Cabaret Letters"), and "Satiren" ("Satires"). His novels betrayed his anarchist, anti-nationalist sympathies and were known for their biting social commentary. Among his best-known works in this genre are "Der neue Ahasver" ("The New Ahasuerus"), "Der letzte Tod des Gautama Buddha" ("The Last Death of Gautama Buddha"), and "Der Atmende Gott" ("The Breathing God").
