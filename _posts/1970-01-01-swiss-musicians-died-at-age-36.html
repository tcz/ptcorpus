						Mani Matter was a Swiss singer-songwriter, musician, and comedian. He was born on August 4, 1936, in Herzogenbuchsee, Switzerland. He was known for his chansons, a type of French-style song that often accompanied a guitar. Throughout his career, Matter released many popular albums, including "Warum syt dir so truurig?," "Ir Ysebahn," and "Hemmige." Matter was also known for his witty and humorous lyrics, which often commented on Swiss culture and society. Despite his success, Matter's career was cut short when he died in a car accident on November 24, 1972, in Kilchberg, Zurich. However, his music remains popular in Switzerland and continues to be celebrated for its cultural significance.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=1354155" title="Wikipedia article about Mani Matter">Mani Matter on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/russian-musicians-died-at-age-44.html' title='Russian musicians died at age 44'><strong>Russian musicians died at age 44</strong> List of the top 2 Russian music stars who died when they were 44</a></li><li><a href='/german-musicians-died-at-age-26.html' title='German musicians died at age 26'><strong>German musicians died at age 26</strong> List of the top 3 German music stars who died when they were 26</a></li><li><a href='/czechoslovakian-musicians-died-in-heart-failure.html' title='Czechoslovakian musicians died in Heart failure'><strong>Czechoslovakian musicians died in Heart failure</strong> List of the top 1 Czechoslovakian music stars who died in Heart failure</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/malaysian-musicians-died-at-age-35.html' title='Malaysian musicians died at age 35'><strong>Malaysian musicians died at age 35</strong> List of the top 1 Malaysian music stars who died when they were 35</a></li><li><a href='/german-actresses-died-in-1992.html' title='German actresses died in 1992'><strong>German actresses died in 1992</strong> List of the top 4 German actresses who died in 1992</a></li><li><a href='/mexican-actors-died-in-emphysema.html' title='Mexican actors died in Emphysema'><strong>Mexican actors died in Emphysema</strong> List of the top 1 Mexican actors who died in Emphysema</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
