(November 15, 1907		Jettingen-Scheppach-July 21, 1944			Berlin)


was
a German
personality.


					
			
		He had
		five
		children,
		Berthold Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, Franz-Ludwig Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, Heimeran Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, Valerie Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg and Konstanze Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg.

						</p><p>Claus von Stauffenberg was a German army officer who played an important role in the failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler on July 20, 1944. He was one of the key figures in the conspiracy within the German military to overthrow the Nazi regime and end World War II. After being wounded in battle in North Africa, Stauffenberg became disillusioned with Hitler's leadership and joined the resistance movement. He was assigned to the Home Army in Berlin, where he became involved in the plot to kill Hitler. On the day of the assassination attempt, Stauffenberg brought a bomb into Hitler's headquarters, but the explosion did not kill the dictator. Stauffenberg was arrested and executed by firing squad that same day. Despite the failure of the assassination attempt, Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators are remembered as heroes who risked their lives to try to end the Nazi regime.</p><p>Stauffenberg was born into an aristocratic family with a long military tradition. He completed his education and joined the military as a cavalry officer in 1926. He served in the German army during World War II and was awarded the Iron Cross for bravery in combat. Despite his loyalty to his country, Stauffenberg became convinced that Hitler was leading Germany towards disaster, both on the military and moral fronts. He was particularly horrified by the regime's treatment of Jews, which he saw as a stain on Germany's honor.</p><p>Stauffenberg became involved in the resistance movement in 1942, after he was severely injured in Tunisia and had to return to Germany for medical treatment. His injuries resulted in the loss of one eye, his right hand, and two fingers on his left hand, but he continued to work for the resistance despite his physical limitations. Along with other military officers, he plotted to overthrow Hitler and negotiate a peace settlement with the Allies.</p><p>Stauffenberg's attempt to kill Hitler was the most daring and well-planned of the numerous attempts on the dictator's life. Although the bomb did not kill Hitler, it did cause significant damage and kill several high-ranking officers who were present at the time. If the operation had succeeded, Stauffenberg was prepared to take over as leader of Germany and negotiate a surrender to the Allies. Despite its failure, the assassination attempt had a significant impact on morale within the German army and encouraged others to join the resistance movement.</p><p>Today, Stauffenberg is remembered as a hero who risked everything to try to save his country from the horrors of the Nazi regime. His story has been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries, and his legacy continues to inspire people who strive for justice and freedom.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in firearm.

(November 28, 1905-November 11, 1942)


was
a German
physicist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on the photoelectric effect, which is the phenomenon of electrons being emitted from a material when light shines on it. Hupfeld studied under Max Planck, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who is considered one of the founders of quantum mechanics. Hupfeld continued to work in the field of quantum mechanics, publishing several papers on the subject. In 1933, however, he was forced to leave Germany due to the rise of the Nazi regime and settled in the United States. There, he worked as a researcher in various institutions, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Tragically, he died at the age of 36 during World War II, while serving as an officer in the United States Army.</p><p>Hans-Hermann Hupfeld was born in Berlin, Germany, and was the son of a civil servant. He attended the University of Berlin, where he studied physics and mathematics. After leaving Germany, Hupfeld traveled to England, where he worked as a research assistant at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. It was there that he met and became friends with another German physicist, Werner Heisenberg, who would go on to win the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1932. Hupfeld continued to work on the photoelectric effect, as well as other aspects of quantum mechanics, during his time in England.</p><p>In 1936, Hupfeld emigrated to the United States and began working at the University of Chicago's physics department. He also worked at the California Institute of Technology before joining the staff at MIT in 1940. At MIT, Hupfeld continued his work in quantum mechanics, but also became interested in the properties of materials at high pressures. He collaborated with Percy Bridgman, another Nobel Prize-winning physicist, on several papers on this subject.</p><p>In 1942, Hupfeld joined the United States Army and was commissioned as a lieutenant. He was sent to Europe as part of the Allied invasion of North Africa and was killed in action on November 11, 1942, during the Battle of Kasserine Pass. He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart for his service.</p><p></p><p>

(November 19, 1865		Hamburg-June 11, 1902			Badenweiler)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a versatile artist, working as a painter, graphic designer, and book designer during his short life. Eckmann was a leading figure in the Art Nouveau movement in Germany, and his work was characterized by flowing, organic lines and a sense of whimsy. He is perhaps best known for his designs for the magazine Die Jugend, which he helped found along with several other prominent artists. After his death from tuberculosis at the age of 36, Eckmann's influence continued to be felt in the world of design, and his legacy still fascinates art historians and collectors today.</p><p>In addition to his work as a graphic and book designer, Otto Eckmann also taught at the Kunstgewerbeschule (school of applied arts) in Düsseldorf. His students included some notable figures in the world of art and design, such as Emil Rudolf Weiss, Heinrich Vogeler, and Paul Renner. Eckmann was also involved in creating stage sets and costumes for theater productions, and his illustrations appeared in several books and journals. He was heavily influenced by the Art Nouveau style of the Belgian artist Henri Privat-Livemont, and his designs often incorporated floral and plant motifs. Eckmann's work was exhibited widely during his lifetime, including at the Paris World's Fair in 1900. Despite his short career, he left a lasting legacy in the world of design, and his contributions to the Art Nouveau movement continue to be celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>

(October 5, 1693		Merseburg-July 7, 1730			Wermsdorf)


was
a German
botanist.


					</p><p>He studied medicine and natural sciences at the University of Jena, and later worked as a physician in Leipzig. Throughout his life, Buxbaum had a passion for botany and exploring new areas of scientific knowledge. </p><p>In 1727, he joined the Russian Academy of Sciences as a member, and went on a botanical expedition to Astrakhan and the Caspian Sea with Peter the Great's naturalist, Johann Daniel Schumacher. Their findings were published in the book "Description of Plants Found in the Neighbourhood of Caspian Sea and Astrachan" in 1729.</p><p>Buxbaum also wrote several papers on the flora of Germany and its surrounding areas. His writing demonstrated his knowledge and understanding of botany, including its classification and the geography and ecology of the different plants. </p><p>Sadly, Buxbaum died at the young age of 36, but his work had a lasting impact on the scientific community, particularly in the fields of botany and ecology. He is remembered as one of the most significant botanists of his time.</p><p>Buxbaum made several contributions to the field of botany, particularly in the study of plant anatomy and morphology. He was among the first botanists to utilize the microscope in plant studies, and his experiments in grafting and breeding plants were ahead of his time. In addition to his work as a botanist, Buxbaum was also a talented artist and illustrated many of his botanical findings with detailed drawings. His illustrations were considered some of the most accurate and beautiful of his time. One of his most notable works is the "Hierophyticon, sive de Plantis Sacris et Magici," which explores the use of plants in ancient religious ceremonies and witchcraft. Buxbaum's legacy continues today, and many botanical specimens bear his name, including the Buxbaumia moss genus.</p><p></p><p>
