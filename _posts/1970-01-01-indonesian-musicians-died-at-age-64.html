						</p><p>Theys Eluay was an advocate for Indigenous rights and was the chairman of the Papuan Presidium Council. He played a key role in the struggle for independence of West Papua, a region in Indonesia that was formerly known as Irian Jaya. Eluay was also known for his efforts to promote democracy and human rights in the region.</p><p>Eluay's political career began in the 1960s when he became involved in the Papuan Student Association. In 1998, he founded the Papuan Presidium Council, which was a coalition of Papuan organizations advocating for self-determination and independence. The organization played a key role in organizing the Papuan People's Congress, a gathering of Papuan leaders that declared independence from Indonesia in 2000.</p><p>Eluay was a controversial figure in Indonesia and was often targeted by the state. He was kidnapped and killed by Indonesian soldiers in 2001, and his death has been a subject of controversy and investigation ever since. Despite his passing, his legacy as a prominent advocate for Papuan independence and human rights continues to inspire many.</p><p>Eluay was born in Sinak, Jayapura Regency, Papua on November 3, 1937. He was of indigenous Papuan descent and grew up in a small village. He received his education in Jayapura and went on to study law at the University of Cenderawasih. After graduation, he worked as a civil servant and later became involved in politics.</p><p>Throughout his political career, Eluay fought for the rights of indigenous Papuans who had suffered under Indonesian rule. He spoke out against Indonesian government policies that he believed were discriminatory towards Papuans, and advocated for greater autonomy and self-determination for the region. He was respected by many in the Papuan community for his tireless efforts to improve their lives.</p><p>Eluay's death in 2001 was a shocking blow to those who had worked with him and admired him. He was abducted by a group of Indonesian soldiers and his body was later found in a remote area, badly beaten and mutilated. The Indonesian government denied any involvement in his death, but many Papuans believe he was murdered because of his outspoken activism.</p><p>Despite the risks involved, Eluay remained committed to his cause until the end of his life. His legacy lives on in the continued struggle of the Papuan people for self-determination, and in the hearts of those who remember him as a hero and champion of indigenous rights.</p><p>Eluay's advocacy for indigenous rights and Papuan independence brought him international attention and recognition. He received the John Humphrey Freedom Award in 2001, which is awarded annually by Canada's Rights and Democracy organization to human rights defenders who have made significant contributions to promoting freedom and democracy in their communities. Eluay was also awarded the Nuclear-Free Future Award in 2000 for his efforts to promote a nuclear-free Pacific and to prevent Indonesia from conducting nuclear tests in the region.</p><p>Eluay's death sparked protests and outrage among the Papuan community, as well as calls for justice and an end to the violence and repression that they had long suffered under Indonesian rule. His legacy continues to inspire activists and advocates fighting for indigenous rights and self-determination around the world, and his name remains synonymous with the struggle for freedom and justice in West Papua.</p><p>Eluay's advocacy for Papuan rights began in the 1960s when he became involved with the Papuan Student Association. His involvement with the organization allowed him to witness firsthand the discrimination and marginalization faced by Papuan students in Indonesia's education system. Eluay's passion for the issue propelled him into politics, where he continued to fight for greater autonomy and self-determination for the Papuan people.</p><p>Eluay's influence continued to grow over the years, and in 2000, he played a critical role in organizing the historic Papuan People's Congress. The Congress was a gathering of hundreds of Papuan leaders and cultural representatives who came together to declare a new government and constitution for West Papua. The gathering was a direct challenge to Indonesia's rule of the region and sparked fierce reprisals from the Indonesian government.</p><p>In the midst of this political turmoil, Eluay and his family became targets of state violence. In 2001, Eluay was abducted and killed by unknown assailants who have never been brought to justice. His death remains a source of deep pain for the Papuan people, who continue to face violence and repression at the hands of the Indonesian government.</p><p>Despite his tragic end, Eluay's legacy as a tireless advocate for Papuan rights continues to inspire and motivate activists around the world. His work remains a vivid reminder of the urgent need for justice and self-determination for the Papuan people, and his name is spoken with reverence and admiration by those fighting for freedom and justice in West Papua.</p><p></p><p>

Gabrielse's legacy has been honored through the naming of streets, schools, and other public places in Indonesia after him. He remains a symbol of resilience and resistance against oppression in Indonesian history.</p><p>Johannes Gabrielse was born into a Dutch-Indonesian family, which was part of the privileged Indo community, and his upbringing exposed him to both Dutch colonial and Indonesian cultures, which influenced his worldview.

He saw the diversity of Indonesian society as a strength rather than a weakness, and he worked to unite Indonesians of different ethnicities, religions, and classes around a common vision of independence and progress. </p><p>Today, Johannes Gabrielse is remembered as a visionary leader who devoted his life to the service of his country and his people. His legacy stands as a testament to the power of individual courage and conviction, and his example continues to inspire all those who seek to build a more just and equitable world.</p><p></p><p>
