						</p><p>Pocahontas was a Native American woman of the Powhatan people, born in present-day Virginia. She is best known for her association with the English colonists who settled in Jamestown in 1607. According to English accounts, Pocahontas saved the life of Englishman John Smith when he was captured by her father, Chief Powhatan. She later married the English settler John Rolfe, and the union helped to establish peace between the Powhatans and the English colonists. </p><p>Pocahontas traveled to England with Rolfe and their son Thomas in 1616, where she was presented as an example of the "civilized" Native American and was received at court. However, she fell ill and died in England in 1617 at the age of 22. She was buried in a churchyard in Gravesend, Kent. Pocahontas has since become a legendary figure in American and English folklore, and her story has been adapted in numerous books, films, and plays.</p><p>Despite her brief life, Pocahontas had a significant impact on the early history of the United States. Her marriage to Rolfe led to a period of peace between the Powhatans and the English colonists, which lasted for several years. Pocahontas is also credited with playing a role in the survival of the Jamestown colony, as she provided the settlers with food and helped them to negotiate with the Powhatan tribe.</p><p>Pocahontas' legacy has continued to inspire people throughout history. She has been the subject of many biographies, poems, and works of art, and her story has been interpreted in many ways. Some people see her as a symbol of the power of love to bridge cultural differences, while others focus on her importance as a Native American leader and advocate for her people. Whatever the interpretation, Pocahontas remains an important figure in both American and English history.</p><p></p><p>
