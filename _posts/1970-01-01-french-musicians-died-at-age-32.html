(November 1, 1530		Sarlat-la-Canéda-August 18, 1563			Bordeaux)

	
		also known as Etienne de La Boetie or Estienne de La Boétie

	
was
a French
philosopher.


					</p><p>La Boétie was a close friend and associate of the famous essayist Michel de Montaigne, and his works had a profound influence on Montaigne's writing. His most famous work, "The Discourse on Voluntary Servitude," explores the concept of political power and the ways in which people become complicit in their own oppression. He was also a prominent magistrate in Bordeaux, serving as a judge and a member of the city's parliament. Despite his short life, La Boétie's ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars around the world.</p><p>In addition to his philosophical and political writings, Étienne de La Boétie was also a talented poet. He wrote a number of sonnets, odes, and elegies, including several dedicated to his close friend Montaigne. La Boétie was a prodigious intellect from a young age, and he excelled in his studies at the University of Orléans. He was a fluent speaker of Latin and Greek, and was well-versed in the classics of both ancient Rome and Greece. Despite his many accomplishments, La Boétie's life was cut tragically short when he died at the age of just 32 from what is believed to have been dysentery. Nevertheless, his legacy as a political thinker, philosopher, and poet continues to inspire and challenge scholars to this day.</p><p>La Boétie was born into a noble family and was educated in law, but he demonstrated a strong affinity for the humanities and the classics. He was also a member of the group of poets and scholars known as the Pléiade, which sought to elevate French literature and make it on par with the great works of ancient Greece and Rome. Despite his privileged background, La Boétie was deeply committed to the principles of freedom and democracy, and he believed that all people were equal and should have the right to govern themselves.</p><p>In addition to his philosophical and literary works, La Boétie was also a devoted friend and mentor to Montaigne. The two men spent endless hours discussing their ideas and debating the most pressing issues of their day. When La Boétie became ill, Montaigne traveled to Bordeaux to be by his side and care for him during his final days. After La Boétie's death, Montaigne honored his friend's memory by including a long essay on him in his "Essays," in which he praised La Boétie's intellect, wit, and bravery.</p><p>Today, La Boétie's ideas remain as relevant as ever, and his writings continue to inspire political thinkers, activists, and scholars around the world. His belief in the power of individuals to resist tyranny and oppression and his call for people to exercise their freedom and assert their rights as citizens continue to resonate with people of all backgrounds and cultures.</p><p></p><p>

(September 26, 1791		Rouen-January 26, 1824			Paris)

	
		otherwise known as Theodore Gericault or Géricault, Théodore

	
was
a French
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the pioneers of the Romantic movement in French art and is best known for his series of paintings called "The Raft of the Medusa." Géricault was also known for his portraits and equestrian paintings. Despite dying at a young age of 32, his work had a significant influence on later artists and movements, including the Impressionists. Géricault was also a trained anatomist and often studied anatomy as part of his artistic education, resulting in a heightened realism in his work.</p><p>Géricault was born into an affluent family, his father being a lawyer and his mother a daughter of a wealthy shipowner. Growing up, Géricault developed a passion for horses which he later integrated into his art, often painting them with great detail and accuracy. He studied under the neoclassical painter Carle Vernet and later under Pierre-Narcisse Guérin, where he learned the techniques of oil painting and classical art. Despite his success as an artist, Géricault suffered from mental health issues and often struggled with depression which was reflected in his work. He also had a turbulent personal life and had affairs with married women. Géricault's pioneering approach to art and his tragic life has made him a figure of fascination for art historians, with his works continuing to inspire and captivate audiences to this day.</p><p>Géricault's most famous work, "The Raft of the Medusa," was inspired by a real-life event in which a French ship ran aground off the coast of Africa in 1816, resulting in the deaths of most of the passengers and crew. The painting depicts the survivors of the shipwreck huddled together on a makeshift raft, with some resorting to cannibalism in order to survive. Géricault's powerful portrayal of the human suffering and resilience in the face of adversity made the painting an instant sensation and a symbol of political and social commentary.  </p><p>In addition to his art, Géricault was also interested in other areas such as archaeology and horse racing. He commissioned a life-size plaster model of the famous Borghese Gladiator statue, which he used as a reference for his paintings. He also owned several racehorses, which he trained himself and raced in local competitions.</p><p>Géricault's legacy can be seen in the works of many artists who followed him, including Eugène Delacroix, Edouard Manet, and Vincent van Gogh. His influence can also be seen in other fields such as literature and music, with authors such as Victor Hugo and Charles Baudelaire citing his work as inspiration. Today, Géricault's paintings are held in museums and private collections worldwide and continue to be celebrated for their emotional intensity and technical skill.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1862		Paris-April 27, 1894)


was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>Charles Laval was a Post-Impressionist painter and a close friend of Paul Gauguin. He studied under renowned artists like Gustave Boulanger and Jules Lefebvre in Paris. Laval's paintings often depicted peaceful and idyllic scenes from his travels, particularly to the Caribbean and Tahiti. He was known for his use of bold colors and loose brushstrokes, which became a hallmark of his style. Unfortunately, Laval's career was cut short by his untimely death at the age of 32 due to alcoholism and complications from syphilis. Despite his short career, he remains an important figure in the history of art, and his works can be found in many prestigious collections worldwide.</p><p>Laval met Paul Gauguin in 1886, and the two became close friends and artistic collaborators. They shared a passion for exploring exotic locales and depicting the people, landscapes, and cultures they discovered through their art. In 1890, Laval joined Gauguin in Tahiti, where he produced some of his most notable works, including "Two Women of Tahiti" and "Nude with Oranges." He also produced paintings during his travels to Martinique, where he lived for several years.</p><p>Laval was part of the Pont-Aven School, a group of artists who gathered in Brittany, France, to paint and socialize. The group included Gauguin, Emile Bernard, and others who were interested in exploring new forms of artistic expression. Laval's work was notable for its use of vivid colors and bold, expressive brushstrokes, which were influenced by the strong light and vibrant colors of the Caribbean and South Pacific.</p><p>Despite his talent and success, Laval struggled with alcoholism and syphilis, which eventually led to his untimely death at the age of 32. His legacy as a Post-Impressionist painter and Gauguin's close friend remains an influential force in the art world, inspiring generations of artists to follow. Laval's works can be found in prominent art museums around the world, including the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p><p>Laval's artistic career began in the 1880s when he studied at the Académie Julian. He quickly gained recognition for his talent and was included in the Salon des Artistes Français in 1888. In the same year, he joined the artistic community in Pont-Aven, where he met Gauguin.</p><p>Laval's oeuvre reflects his love for travel and exploration. His paintings depict warm, bright and lush landscapes, often with a focus on the female form. He used color boldly and his brushstrokes gave his work a sense of movement and immediacy.</p><p>Despite his brief career, Laval's influence on the art world was significant. He was admired by fellow artists and his legacy continued to inspire the Post-Impressionist movement and beyond. In 1895, a posthumous exhibition of his works was held in Paris, and in 1906 a room was dedicated to his works at the Salon d'Automne.</p><p></p><p>
