(August 16, 1845		Bonnevoie-July 13, 1921			Atlantic Ocean)


was
a French
physicist, scientist and inventor.


					</p><p>He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908 for his work on the photographic reproduction of colors. Lippmann's research focused on the study of the properties of light and its interaction with matter, and he made important contributions to the fields of electrochemistry, thermodynamics and acoustics. In addition to his scientific pursuits, Lippmann was also a highly regarded teacher and mentor, and his students included several future Nobel laureates. Despite his numerous achievements and contributions to science, Lippmann remained modest and unassuming throughout his life, preferring to focus on the work rather than on personal recognition.</p><p>Lippmann was born in Luxembourg to a Franco-Jewish family, but his family moved to France when he was six years old. He studied physics and chemistry at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris and later became a professor at Sorbonne University. Lippmann published numerous papers and articles throughout his career, and he was known for his meticulous attention to detail and innovative experimental techniques.</p><p>One of Lippmann's most significant contributions to science was his invention of the Lippmann Plate, a photographic process that allowed for the reproduction of natural colors using only black and white film. The process involved creating a fine-grained metallic plate with a thin layer of mercury on its surface. When exposed to light, the plate produced a series of interference fringes that were then recorded on a piece of photographic paper. The resulting image had a remarkable level of color fidelity and was widely regarded as a major breakthrough in color photography.</p><p>Lippmann's work on the properties of light also led to important advances in the study of diffraction and polarization, and he made significant contributions to the field of spectroscopy. In recognition of his pioneering work, Lippmann was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1886 and was awarded numerous scientific prizes and honors during his lifetime. He died while aboard the ocean liner SS France, en route to New York to attend a scientific conference.</p><p>Lippmann's legacy lives on in the many scientific fields he contributed to throughout his career. His work on acoustics provided a foundation for the development of sonar technology, which in turn led to advances in underwater exploration and communication. Lippmann's research on thermodynamics has also been applied in areas such as materials science and energy conservation. In addition, the Lippmann Plate process he invented has influenced modern photographic and printing techniques.Lippmann's dedication to scientific research and excellence earned him the respect and admiration of his colleagues and students, and his contributions have had a lasting impact on the scientific community. Despite his tremendous achievements, Lippmann remained humble and dedicated to his work, paving the way for future generations of scientists to continue pushing the boundaries of knowledge and discovery.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Charles-Marie-Rene Leconte de Lisle

	
was
a French
poet.


					</p><p>He was one of the leaders of the Parnassian movement in French poetry, which emphasized strict craftsmanship and formalism. Leconte de Lisle was known for his meticulous attention to the sounds and rhythms of words, and his poetry often drew on themes from history, mythology, and exotic cultures. He was deeply influenced by the works of the Greek poet Homer, and his translations of ancient Greek works earned him a reputation as a master of the classical tradition. Despite his success as a poet, Leconte de Lisle struggled with depression and alcoholism throughout his life. He was also a passionate advocate for French colonialism, which led to criticism of his work later in the 20th century. Despite these controversies, Leconte de Lisle remains an important figure in the history of French literature, and his works continue to be studied and admired by scholars and readers around the world.</p><p>Leconte de Lisle was born into a wealthy family on the island of Réunion, which was then a French colony in the Indian Ocean. He received a classical education in France and studied law before turning to literature. His early works were heavily influenced by the Romantic poets, but he later rejected their sentimentalism and embraced the Parnassian ideals of discipline and restraint. Leconte de Lisle was a prolific writer, and his collections of poetry include "Poèmes antiques" (1852), "Poèmes barbares" (1862), and "Poèmes tragiques" (1884). He was also a respected critic and member of the French Academy. In addition to his poetry and translations, Leconte de Lisle wrote essays on a wide range of topics, including art, music, and politics. His impact on French literature can be seen in the work of later writers such as Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Valéry.</p><p>Leconte de Lisle's work was admired not only in France but also in other parts of Europe and in the United States. His poetry was translated into English by some of the leading translators of the time, including Algernon Charles Swinburne and Richard Hovey. Leconte de Lisle was also a mentor to many younger poets, including José-Maria de Heredia and Anatole France. Despite his conservative politics, he was admired by left-wing writers such as Emile Zola and Guy de Maupassant for his poetry's technical skill and beauty. Leconte de Lisle's legacy as a poet and translator continues to be celebrated today, and his works are widely read in French literature classrooms around the world.</p><p></p><p>

was
a French
physician and politician.


					</p><p>Joseph-Ignace Guillotin is most well known for advocating for a more humane method of execution during the French Revolution. He proposed the use of a machine that would quickly and cleanly sever a person's head, which would eventually become known as the guillotine. Contrary to popular belief, Guillotin did not invent the device and was even opposed to its use as a means of execution. He believed that the death penalty should be abolished altogether. Besides his work on capital punishment, Guillotin also served as a member of the National Assembly and the Paris Commune during the Revolution.</p><p>Joseph-Ignace Guillotin was born to Claude Guillotin and Marie-Nicole in Saintes, France. His father was a successful lawyer and Joseph-Ignace followed in his footsteps, studying law and medicine at the University of Bordeaux. He practiced medicine in Paris and was a member of the Royal Society of Medicine before becoming involved in politics.</p><p>Guillotin was a supporter of the French Revolution and served as a deputy to the National Assembly in 1789. He was also a member of the Municipal Council of Paris and the Paris Commune. He espoused progressive views and advocated for social and political reforms. He was also a vocal opponent of capital punishment, which led him to propose the machine that would later bear his name.</p><p>Despite his opposition to the use of the guillotine, the device became the preferred method of execution during the Revolution and continued to be used in France until 1977. Guillotin's name became synonymous with the machine, but he never took credit for its invention.</p><p>In addition to his work on capital punishment and politics, Guillotin was an active member of several scientific societies and wrote several books on medicine and anatomy. He died of natural causes in Paris in 1814.</p><p>Guillotin's legacy is complicated due to his association with the guillotine. While he did not invent it and was opposed to its use, his name is forever linked to one of the most notorious symbols of the Revolutionary Terror. However, his advocacy for the abolition of the death penalty and his contributions to medicine and science make him a complex figure in French history.</p><p>Despite his legacy with the guillotine, Joseph-Ignace Guillotin made significant contributions to medicine and science. He was a respected physician and a member of the Royal Society of Medicine, where he presented papers on topics such as blood transfusions, skin diseases, and the healing of bones. He also wrote several books on anatomy and medicine, including a work on venereal disease that was praised by his contemporaries.</p><p>Guillotin's interest in science extended beyond medicine. He was a member of the French Academy of Sciences and the Society of Agriculture, where he promoted the study of chemistry and agriculture. He also advocated for the establishment of a national museum of natural history, which later became the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris.</p><p>Guillotin's political career was marked by his progressive views on social and political reform. He was a supporter of the rights of women and minorities and helped draft several laws that advanced these causes. He also opposed slavery and the death penalty, which led him to propose the guillotine as a more humane method of execution.</p><p>Despite his mixed legacy, Joseph-Ignace Guillotin remains an important figure in French history. His contributions to medicine and science and his advocacy for social and political reform are a testament to his progressive spirit and his commitment to improving the world around him.</p><p></p><p>

Coustou was instrumental in the development of the Rococo style of sculpture, which followed the Baroque period. He was especially skilled in creating dynamic and dramatic compositions that conveyed a sense of movement and energy. Coustou's influence on French sculpture can still be seen today, and his works are widely regarded as some of the finest examples of the Baroque and Rococo styles.</p><p>Coustou was known for sculpting figures in a lifelike manner, which was a departure from the more idealized forms that were popular during the Renaissance period. He was particularly adept at capturing the emotions and expressions of his subjects, which he achieved through his attention to detail and his use of light and shadow. Among his most famous works is the equestrian statue of King Louis XV, which stands in the Place de la Concorde in Paris. Coustou also created several busts of the king, as well as sculptures of other members of the royal family. Despite his success, Coustou was also known for his generosity and his willingness to help other artists. He taught several students, including his nephew, who went on to become successful sculptors in their own right. Coustou died in Paris in 1733 at the age of 75.</p><p></p><p>

was
a French
economist, philosopher and mathematician.


					</p><p>He is considered to be one of the founders of mathematical economics and he became famous for his work in game theory and the concept of oligopoly. </p><p>Cournot also held several academic positions and was a professor of mathematics at the University of Lyon. He wrote several influential works on economics, including "Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth". This work offered a comprehensive approach to the study of economics and included mathematical formulas that helped explain economic behavior.</p><p>In addition to his work in economics, Cournot was also interested in philosophy and wrote an important book on the philosophy of science called "The Logic of the Moral Sciences". </p><p>His contributions to the field of economics have had a lasting impact and have helped shape modern economic theory.</p><p>Cournot was born in Gray, a small town in Eastern France, and began his academic career studying mathematics and science at the École nationale des Ponts et Chaussées in Paris. In 1829, he became a professor of mathematics at the University of Lyon, where he published his first book on the application of mathematics to the analysis of economic phenomena. </p><p>Cournot's most famous contribution to economics was his analysis of oligopolistic competition, which he first presented in his book "Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses" published in 1838. In this book, he introduced the concept of the "Cournot duopoly", which is a model of competition between two firms, each of which sets its output level based on its expectation of the other firm's output level. Cournot's work on oligopoly was groundbreaking and has influenced economic theory and policy to this day.</p><p>Despite his pioneering work in economics, Cournot remained a devoted philosopher throughout his life, and his work on the philosophy of science has also garnered significant attention. In "The Logic of the Moral Sciences", he developed a logical approach to the social sciences, which he argued had been neglected in favor of empirical analysis. Cournot's approach appealed to philosophers, sociologists, and economists alike, and his ideas about the limitation of empirical studies in the social sciences continue to shape the discipline today.</p><p>Antoine Augustin Cournot is widely regarded as one of the most important economists and thinkers of the 19th Century, and his contributions continue to influence the fields of economics and philosophy today.</p><p>Cournot also held political office, serving as a member of the French parliament from 1848 to 1851. Despite his short political career, he was a strong advocate for free trade and was critical of government intervention in the economy. He believed that individuals and businesses should be free to make their own economic decisions without interference from the state. This belief was reflected in his economic writings, which emphasized the importance of market competition and the role of incentives in economic decision-making. </p><p>Cournot's impact on economics can also be seen in his development of the concept of elasticity. He recognized that the demand for a product could vary depending on its price, and he developed a mathematical formula to describe this relationship. This concept is now a fundamental part of economic theory, and understanding demand elasticity is crucial for businesses and policymakers alike.</p><p>Throughout his life, Cournot was highly regarded by his peers and received numerous honors and awards for his work. He was a member of the prestigious French Academy of Sciences and was awarded the Legion of Honor for his contributions to economics and mathematics. Despite his many accomplishments, Cournot remained modest and humble, and he always maintained a strong sense of intellectual curiosity and a commitment to rational inquiry.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1792-April 5, 1867)


was
a French
physician and surgeon.


					</p><p>He is known for his development of a technique for surgically removing bladder stones, known as lithotripsy. Civiale's technique involved breaking the stone into small pieces with a specialized instrument, allowing for easier extraction. This method revolutionized the treatment of bladder stones and made it possible to perform the procedure without major surgical incisions.</p><p>Civiale also invented several medical instruments, including a urethroscope and an endoscope for examining the bladder. He was a prolific writer and published numerous works on medicine and surgery, including a comprehensive treatise on lithotripsy.</p><p>In addition to his medical achievements, Civiale was a respected member of the French Academy of Medicine and served as a professor of surgery at the Paris School of Medicine. He was also awarded the Legion of Honour for his contributions to the field of medicine.</p><p>Civiale came from a family of doctors and initially trained as a pharmacist before pursuing medicine. He earned his medical degree at the École de Médecine in Paris in 1824 and shortly afterward began practicing as a surgeon. Civiale's interest in lithotripsy was sparked by his observations of a street performer breaking stones with an iron bar. He began experimenting with different instruments and techniques, ultimately developing the lithotrite, which used a screw mechanism to crush stones.Civiale's technique was initially met with skepticism from the medical community, but he persisted in refining it and eventually gained wide acclaim. Today, lithotripsy is a common and minimally invasive procedure used to treat bladder stones.Civiale died on his 75th birthday in Paris, leaving behind a legacy that revolutionized the treatment of bladder stones and advanced the field of medicine.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Civiale faced his fair share of controversy during his career. Some of his contemporaries accused him of stealing credit for the invention of the lithotrite from others who had worked on similar instruments. Civiale himself was also accused of unethical conduct during some of his operations. Nevertheless, his contributions to the medical field remain significant and his technique for lithotripsy is still in use today.</p><p>Civiale also had a personal interest in mineralogy and geology, which he pursued outside of his medical profession. He was a member of several scientific societies and wrote about his findings in journals of the time. In addition to his scientific pursuits, Civiale was also an accomplished artist and sculptor, with several of his works still on display in museums.</p><p>Today, Civiale is remembered not only for his innovative medical techniques, but also for his dedication to his various interests and his commitment to advancing the field of medicine.
