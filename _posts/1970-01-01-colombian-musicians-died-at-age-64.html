(January 22, 1930		Colombia-November 1, 1994)


was
a Colombian
personality.


					</p><p>A notorious serial killer and rapist, Daniel Camargo Barbosa was responsible for the rape and murder of more than 70 young girls in Colombia and Ecuador between the 1970s and the 1980s. Born in a poor family in a rural area of Colombia, Camargo had a tumultuous childhood that included poverty, abandonment, and violence. He began his criminal career as a petty thief when he was a teenager and was later imprisoned for assaulting a woman.</p><p>Upon his release from prison, Camargo began preying on young girls, mainly street children and those from poor families, whom he would lure into his trap with the promise of food, money or gifts. He would then rape and murder them, sometimes torturing them first, before dumping their bodies in a remote location. His heinous crimes went undetected for years, partly due to the authorities' lack of resources and indifference to the plight of poor and marginalized victims.</p><p>It wasn't until Camargo traveled to Ecuador in the 1980s that he was finally apprehended, thanks to the efforts of a determined police chief who tracked him down using forensic evidence. Camargo was eventually convicted of 72 murders and sentenced to 30 years in prison. However, before he could serve his full sentence, he was murdered in his cell by one of his fellow inmates. Despite his dark legacy, Camargo's case sparked a national debate in Colombia about the need for better law enforcement and judicial reforms that would protect the rights of all citizens, regardless of their socio-economic status.</p><p></p><p>
