(January 22, 1930		Colombia-November 1, 1994)


was
a Colombian
personality.


					</p><p>A notorious serial killer and rapist, Daniel Camargo Barbosa was responsible for the rape and murder of more than 70 young girls in Colombia and Ecuador between the 1970s and the 1980s. Born in a poor family in a rural area of Colombia, Camargo had a tumultuous childhood that included poverty, abandonment, and violence. He began his criminal career as a petty thief when he was a teenager and was later imprisoned for assaulting a woman.</p><p>Upon his release from prison, Camargo began preying on young girls, mainly street children and those from poor families, whom he would lure into his trap with the promise of food, money or gifts. He would then rape and murder them, sometimes torturing them first, before dumping their bodies in a remote location. His heinous crimes went undetected for years, partly due to the authorities' lack of resources and indifference to the plight of poor and marginalized victims.</p><p>It wasn't until Camargo traveled to Ecuador in the 1980s that he was finally apprehended, thanks to the efforts of a determined police chief who tracked him down using forensic evidence. Camargo was eventually convicted of 72 murders and sentenced to 30 years in prison. However, before he could serve his full sentence, he was murdered in his cell by one of his fellow inmates. Despite his dark legacy, Camargo's case sparked a national debate in Colombia about the need for better law enforcement and judicial reforms that would protect the rights of all citizens, regardless of their socio-economic status.</p><p>Camargo's horrific crimes earned him the nickname "The Sadist of Chanquito", in reference to the neighborhood where many of his victims lived. He admitted to his crimes and spoke openly about his motivations, claiming that he had a hatred of women and enjoyed torturing and killing them. He also confessed to having cannibalized some of his victims' corpses. </p><p>Camargo's legacy continues to haunt Colombia and Ecuador, with many citing his case as an example of the pervasive issue of violence and impunity in the region. Since his death, he has been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries exploring the psychology behind his crimes and the social and political factors that allowed him to operate with impunity for so long. Despite his notoriety, Camargo's victims' families continue to struggle for justice and recognition, often facing stigma and discrimination due to their poverty and social status.</p><p>Daniel Camargo Barbosa's crimes and the legacy of his trial have had long-lasting effects on the law enforcement systems of Colombia and Ecuador. His case was one of the first trials in Latin America to use forensic evidence, which set a precedent for future cases of a similar nature. Camargo was also the subject of many studies by criminologists and psychologists, who sought to understand the motives behind his sadistic crimes.</p><p>In addition to his heinous actions, Camargo's personal life was also marked by a series of tragedies. His first wife died in childbirth, and he suffered from the loss of his only child who died young. He was also abandoned by his second wife who took their daughter with her. Camargo was left with no immediate family, and it is suggested that this may have contributed to his desire to exert control and power over his victims.</p><p>Despite the gruesome nature of his crimes, many of Camargo's victims have been forgotten or overlooked due to societal factors, such as poverty and marginalization, which continue to affect many communities in Colombia and Ecuador. The legacy of Camargo serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle for justice and equality in the region.</p><p></p><p>
