(November 19, 1831		Moreland Hills-September 19, 1881			Elberon)

	
		also known as James Abram Garfield

	
was
an American
politician, lawyer, teacher and laity.


					
			
		He had
		seven
		children,
		Mary Garfield, Harry Augustus Garfield, James Rudolph Garfield, Irvin M. Garfield, Edward Garfield, Abram Garfield and Eliza Garfield.

						</p><p>Garfield was the 20th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1881 until his assassination on September 19, 1881, just six months into his term. Prior to his presidency, Garfield served in the U.S. House of Representatives and was also a Union Army general during the American Civil War. He was known for his strong stance against corruption in government and support for civil rights for African Americans. Garfield was the second U.S. President to be assassinated, after Abraham Lincoln. Despite his brief presidency, Garfield left a lasting legacy in the history of the United States.</p><p>Garfield grew up in poverty and had to work hard to support himself and his family. He worked as a janitor and a carpenter before attending college, where he excelled academically. He became a professor of languages and literature before turning to law and politics.</p><p>In 1862, Garfield was elected to Congress, where he quickly gained a reputation as a brilliant orator and a staunch advocate for the Union cause. He served on several committees, including the Military Affairs Committee and the Committee on Banking and Currency. In 1880, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, but before he could take office, he was nominated for president by the Republican Party.</p><p>Garfield's presidency was marked by his commitment to civil service reform and his efforts to improve the nation's financial system. He appointed several reform-minded officials to his administration and signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law, which established the merit-based system for hiring and promoting government employees.</p><p>Tragically, Garfield's presidency was cut short when he was shot by Charles J. Guiteau on July 2, 1881. Despite doctors' efforts to save him, Garfield died of complications from his wounds 11 weeks later. He was mourned by the nation and is remembered as one of the most promising and principled leaders in American history.</p><p>Garfield's assassination was a shock to the nation and sparked widespread outrage against political violence. His killer, Charles J. Guiteau, was a mentally unstable lawyer who believed he deserved a government position and shot Garfield hoping to gain favor with the politicians who he believed would take his side. Guiteau was quickly arrested, tried, and executed for the crime. </p><p>Garfield's presidency was also marked by his commitment to the expansion of education in the United States. He was a strong advocate for public schools and believed that education was essential for national progress and equality. Garfield worked to increase federal funding for education and also supported the establishment of African American colleges in the South. </p><p>In addition to his political and educational accomplishments, Garfield was also a gifted linguist and language scholar. He could speak several languages, including Latin, Greek, and German, and was a founding member of the American Philological Association. Garfield also had a deep love for literature and was known for his extensive library, which he often shared with his friends and colleagues. </p><p>Garfield's memory is honored by several institutions, including the James A. Garfield National Historic Site, a preserved home in Mentor, Ohio, where Garfield lived with his family. Garfield's legacy as a champion of civil rights, education, and reform continues to inspire Americans today.</p><p>Garfield's assassination led to changes in the way the president was protected. After his death, Congress allocated money for the training of Secret Service agents, who were charged with the protection of the president. Before that, presidents had no formal bodyguards, and it was common for them to move about freely in public places. Garfield's death also led to the development of medical procedures that aimed to improve the odds of a president's survival in case of an assassination attempt. One of the doctors who attended to Garfield, Dr. D. Willard Bliss, was criticized for his treatment of the president and accused of making his condition worse. The controversy that surrounded Garfield's medical treatment led to a debate about the professionalization of medical education and the need for medical standards in the United States.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in pneumonia.

This marked a significant advancement in transportation, as it allowed for faster and more efficient travel of goods and people along the country's waterways. Fulton was also a skilled painter and spent several years in Europe studying art before returning to America to pursue his engineering ventures. In addition to his work on the steamboat, he also designed and built several other successful inventions, including a submarine and a torpedo boat.</p><p>Fulton began his career as a painter, working primarily with miniatures. In 1786, he moved to Europe to continue his studies and live with Benjamin West, an American artist who was then at the height of his career. In Europe, Fulton became interested in engineering and the mechanics of canal systems. He designed a number of canal locks and other water-related devices, but it was his work on steam power that would ultimately capture his attention.</p><p>Fulton's steamboat was not the first ever built, but it was the first to be commercially successful, and it revolutionized travel and transportation in America. Prior to the steamboat, travel and trade on the waterways of the United States was slow and often difficult. The steamboat made it possible to transport goods, people, and information more quickly and efficiently, opening up new markets and spurring economic growth.</p><p>In addition to his work on steam power, Fulton also designed and built several ship-borne weapons of war, including a submarine and a torpedo boat. His submarine, the Nautilus, was used by the British navy during the War of 1812. Fulton continued to work on new inventions up until his death, and his legacy as an inventor and engineer continues to be felt to this day.</p><p>Fulton also played a key role in the development of the Erie Canal, a massive engineering project that connected the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and helped open up the western United States for settlement and trade. He served as a consultant on the project and designed several of the canal's locks and aqueducts. Fulton's work on the Erie Canal helped establish him as one of the foremost engineers of his time, and his innovative solutions to complex engineering problems continue to be studied and admired by engineers today.</p><p>Despite his success as an engineer, Fulton never lost his love for art. He continued to paint throughout his life and exhibited his works at a number of prestigious galleries and exhibitions. Many of his paintings depict scenes from his travels in Europe and America, and they provide a fascinating glimpse into the world of transportation and technological innovation during the early years of the United States. Today, Fulton is remembered not only for his pioneering work on steam power and canal engineering, but also for his contributions to the art world.</p><p>Fulton was born in a farming family in Pennsylvania. He was the third of five children and had a knack for tinkering with machines from a young age. His father died when he was only three years old, and his mother remarried a man who encouraged his interest in science and engineering. This led Fulton to later pursue his interests in technology and invention.</p><p>After returning to America from Europe, Fulton became involved in a project that aimed to build a canal system to connect the Great Lakes to the Hudson River. He saw this as a way to improve transportation and stimulate economic growth. Fulton's designs for the canal system included innovative features such as lift locks and aqueducts, which helped to make the canal more efficient and cost-effective.</p><p>Fulton also continued to work on steam power, building new and improved steam engines that were more reliable and efficient than earlier designs. He developed a number of other inventions as well, including a system for drilling rocks with steam power and a machine for spinning rope.</p><p>Fulton's contributions to transportation and engineering had a profound impact on the early economic development of the United States. His steamboat made it possible to navigate waterways with greater ease and speed, and his work on the Erie Canal helped to connect the eastern and western parts of the country. Today, Fulton is rightfully considered one of the major inventors and engineers of the early Industrial Revolution in America.</p><p></p><p>

(December 20, 1833		Charles County-January 10, 1883			Waldorf)

	
		also known as Dr. Samuel Mudd

	
was
an American
physician.


					</p><p>Mudd is best known for his role in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for his alleged involvement in the plot. However, Mudd maintained his innocence and claimed that he only treated the injured assassin, John Wilkes Booth, without knowledge of his crime. Mudd's sentence was eventually commuted by President Andrew Johnson and he was released from prison in 1869. Mudd returned to his medical practice in Maryland and continued to serve his community until his death.</p><p>Mudd graduated from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 1856 and began practicing medicine in his hometown of Bryantown, Maryland. During the Civil War, he served as a physician for the Confederate Army. After his release from prison in 1869, Mudd faced difficulty reintegrating into his community due to the stigma associated with his involvement in the assassination plot. He eventually moved to Waldorf, Maryland, where he resumed his medical career and became a respected member of the community. In addition to his medical practice, Mudd was also involved in local politics and served on the board of education. Mudd's reputation has been somewhat rehabilitated in recent years, with some historians arguing that he was unfairly scapegoated for his peripheral involvement in the assassination plot.</p><p>Mudd's involvement in the Lincoln assassination has been the subject of numerous books and articles, and his story has been portrayed in several movies and television shows. Despite the controversy surrounding his involvement, Mudd has been remembered for his contributions to the medical field. In honor of his work as a physician, a medical center in Maryland was named after him, which has since merged with two other local hospitals to form the University of Maryland Charles Regional Medical Center. Mudd's home in Maryland, where he treated Booth, has also been preserved and is now a tourist attraction. Today, Mudd is still remembered as a controversial figure in American history whose story highlights the challenges of reintegrating into society after being labeled a criminal.</p><p>Mudd's family played a significant role in the development of the region where he lived. They owned a plantation and many slaves, but Mudd opposed secession at the start of the Civil War, causing a rift with his pro-Confederate family. His assistance to Booth after the assassination proved to be a further source of controversy that followed him throughout his life. Even after his release from prison, there were those who regarded him as a traitor and murderer. Nevertheless, Mudd remained active in his community and continued to practice medicine until his death.</p><p>Mudd's case is still disputed by some historians and legal scholars today, with some arguing that his trial was flawed and that he was wrongly convicted. In 1979, Mudd's descendants successfully petitioned the Governor of Maryland for a pardon, based on the fact that Mudd had provided medical care to victims of a yellow fever epidemic while imprisoned in Florida. The governor issued a proclamation declaring that the pardon was based on "judicial error" rather than absolving Mudd of guilt. Despite the controversy surrounding his case, Mudd's story remains an important part of American history and a fascinating example of the complex relationships between politics, medicine, and the law.</p><p></p><p>
