(December 23, 1805		Sharon-June 27, 1844			Carthage)

	
		also known as Mayor Joseph Smith, Jr. or Joseph Smith, Jr.

	
was
an American
tradesman and politician.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Joseph Smith III and Julia Murdock Smith.

						</p><p>Joseph Smith was the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, commonly known as the Mormon Church. He was born in Sharon, Vermont and spent much of his childhood moving around with his family. In 1820, he had a vision of God the Father and Jesus Christ, which led him to start seeking answers about religion. </p><p>In 1823, Smith said he was visited by angel Moroni and informed of an ancient record, which he translated and published as the Book of Mormon in 1830. He quickly gained a large following and established the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. </p><p>Smith faced much persecution and opposition from non-Mormon neighbors, leading to the church's expulsion from several states before finally settling in Nauvoo, Illinois. Smith was also involved in politics, serving as mayor of Nauvoo and running for President of the United States. </p><p>In 1844, he was arrested and jailed for destroying a printing press that was critical of him and the church. While in jail, he was killed by a mob, which led to increased violence against the church and its members. Despite this, the LDS church continued to grow and is now a global organization with millions of members.</p><p>Joseph Smith's teachings and leadership have had a significant impact on American religion and culture. Many of his beliefs, including the importance of family and the concept of eternal marriage, continue to be central to the LDS church today. Smith's life and legacy have also been the subject of much controversy and debate. Some critics have alleged that he was a fraud and that the Book of Mormon was not a legitimate record, while others see him as a visionary leader who inspired a religious movement. Regardless of one's views on Smith, his impact on American religious history remains significant to this day.</p><p>After Joseph Smith's death, leadership of the LDS church passed to Brigham Young, who led the group westward to what is now Salt Lake City, Utah. The church established a theocratic government in Utah, which became a territory of the United States in 1850, leading to conflicts with the federal government. This eventually resulted in the abandonment of the church's practice of polygamy in 1890, which allowed Utah to become a state in 1896.</p><p>Today, the LDS church has over 16 million members worldwide and is known for its emphasis on missionary work, family values, and strict adherence to a set of religious and moral guidelines known as the Word of Wisdom. The church has also been involved in various humanitarian and social programs, including disaster relief efforts, education initiatives, and aid to refugees.</p><p>Despite ongoing controversies surrounding the LDS church, Joseph Smith remains a revered figure among believers, who view him as a prophet and the restorer of ancient Christianity. His life and teachings continue to influence the beliefs and practices of millions of people around the world.</p><p>Smith's death at the hands of a mob has been a source of controversy and speculation for many years. While some believe that he was killed as a result of his religious beliefs, others argue that his actions as a political and military leader in Nauvoo had made him many enemies, leading to his assassination. In any case, his death was a significant loss for the LDS church, which was forced to navigate a period of turmoil and uncertainty in the years following his passing.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the LDS church continued to grow and evolve, under the leadership of Brigham Young and subsequent presidents. The church's emphasis on family values, missionary work, and community service has helped it to become one of the most influential religious organizations in the world today. While Smith's role in the church's history may be debated, his impact on the faith and its followers remains undeniable.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in murder.
