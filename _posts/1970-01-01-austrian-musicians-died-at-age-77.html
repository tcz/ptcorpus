Today, Heinricher's name is synonymous with excellence in botany, and he is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of Austrian biology.</p><p>Heinricher's legacy was carried on by his students, many of whom went on to become prominent botanists themselves. One of his most famous students was Karl Holzner, who became Heinricher's successor as professor of botany at the University of Innsbruck. Holzner continued Heinricher's work on the flora of Tyrol and later authored a book on the alpine flora of Europe. Heinricher's influence can also be seen in the continued growth and development of the botanical garden at the University of Innsbruck, which has expanded to include a wide range of plant species from around the world. Today, visitors to the garden can see many of the plants that Heinricher collected and studied during his lifetime. Overall, Heinricher's contributions to botany and his dedication to the field continue to inspire new generations of scientists and researchers.</p><p></p><p>
