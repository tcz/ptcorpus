(December 10, 1815		London-November 27, 1852			Marylebone)

	
		also known as Augusta Ada Byron, Augusta Ada King, The Right Honourable Augusta Ada, Countess of Lovelace, Ada Byron, Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace or The Hon. Augusta Ada Byron

	
was
a British
scientist, writer, mathematician, computer scientist and programmer.


					
			
		Her children
		are
		
		Anne Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth, Byron King-Noel, Viscount Ockham and Ralph King-Milbanke, 2nd Earl of Lovelace.

						</p><p>Ada Lovelace was the daughter of Lord Byron, a well-known poet, and his wife, Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke. Despite her father's absence from her life, Ada exhibited her father's passion for creativity and an interest in scientific inquiry that was instilled in her by her mother. Ada's mother believed that math and science would help Ada avoid the mental instability that ran in her father's side of the family.</p><p>Ada was introduced to Charles Babbage, the inventor of the Analytical Engine, a mechanical computer that could perform a variety of tasks, and was fascinated by his work. She became interested in how the machine worked and saw its potential beyond just computing numbers. Ada's notes on the machine, which include an algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers, are considered to be the first written computer program, earning her the title "the world's first computer programmer."</p><p>Ada was a highly influential figure in the development of computer science, with her concepts and ideas paving the way for the creation of modern computing. Ada's legacy has been recognized through the Ada Lovelace Day, an annual celebration of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.</p><p>Aside from being a mathematician and computer scientist, Ada Lovelace was also a writer. In fact, she wrote many letters and journals throughout her life, including letters to her mother that were published in a book titled Memoirs of a Philosopher. Ada was also a translator, translating an article about Babbage's Analytical Engine from French to English. She was friends with many influential people in the scientific community, including Michael Faraday and Charles Dickens. Ada Lovelace's impact on computer science was not initially recognized, and it was not until the 1950s that her notes on the Analytical Engine were rediscovered and her contributions to computer programming were acknowledged. In recent years, Ada Lovelace has become a symbol of women's contributions to science and technology and is admired for her work in a field that was exclusively male-dominated at the time.</p><p></p><p>
						She died as a result of bled by physicians.

(March 17, 1828		Ovens, County Cork-November 30, 1864			Franklin)


was
a British
personality.


					</p><p>Actually, Patrick Cleburne was an Irish-born soldier who fought for the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. He is best known for his leadership and bravery on the battlefield, particularly at the Battle of Stones River and the Battle of Chickamauga. Born in County Cork, Ireland, Cleburne immigrated to the United States in 1849 and settled in Arkansas, where he worked as a pharmacist before joining the Confederate Army in 1861. Despite his lack of formal military training, Cleburne quickly rose through the ranks and became one of the most successful commanders in the Confederate Army. He was killed at the Battle of Franklin in 1864, but his legacy as a skilled military strategist and inspiring leader lives on.</p><p>During his time in the Confederate Army, Patrick Cleburne was praised for his tactical innovations on the battlefield. He is best remembered for his "double envelopment" strategy, which involved attacking the enemy's flanks from two sides simultaneously. This strategy proved highly effective at both Stones River and Chickamauga, earning Cleburne a reputation as one of the most brilliant tacticians of the war. </p><p>In addition to his military prowess, Cleburne was also known for his strong beliefs on civil rights. In 1863, he proposed a controversial plan to the Confederate government that called for the emancipation of slaves in exchange for their military service. While the proposal was ultimately rejected, Cleburne's support for the cause of abolition made him a rare voice of dissent in an army that was staunchly pro-slavery.</p><p>After his death at the Battle of Franklin, Cleburne was widely mourned by both the Confederate and Union armies. His fellow officers remembered him as a courageous and visionary leader, while his men affectionately referred to him as the "Stonewall of the West" in honor of his bravery on the battlefield. Today, Cleburne is remembered as one of the most fascinating and enigmatic figures of the Civil War era.</p><p></p><p>

(May 16, 1805		Montrose-November 2, 1841			Kabul)


was
a British
personality.


					</p><p>Burnes was an explorer and a travel writer who is best known for his travels to Central Asia and the Himalayas. He worked for the British East India Company and played an important role in establishing friendly relations between the British and the rulers of Afghanistan and Sikh Empire.</p><p>During his travels to Central Asia, Burnes collected valuable information about the region and compiled his observations in his travelogues, which were highly regarded by his contemporaries. He also took an interest in the local culture and language and was able to converse fluently in Persian, Hindustani, and Pashto.</p><p>However, his success in building diplomatic relations was cut short when he was killed by an angry mob during an uprising in Afghanistan. His death was a significant setback for British influence in the region and contributed to the outbreak of the First Anglo-Afghan War. </p><p>Despite his tragic end, Burnes' legacy as a traveler, writer, and diplomat lives on. He is remembered for his bravery, his deep understanding of different cultures, and his contributions to the field of geography and political science.</p><p>Burnes was born into a family of Scottish merchants and received his education at the University of Edinburgh. He joined the British East India Company in 1821 and was soon appointed as a junior assistant to the Political Agent in Cutch. In 1829, he was sent to the court of the Emir of Afghanistan to secure trading rights for the British. This mission was a success, and Burnes was rewarded with a promotion to the position of Political Agent in Afghanistan.</p><p>In addition to his diplomatic work, Burnes continued to explore Central Asia and the Himalayan region. He made several journeys to the source of the Indus River and was the first European to visit the city of Bukhara. He also wrote several books about his travels, including "Travels into Bokhara" and "Cabool: A Personal Narrative".</p><p>Burnes had a great interest in the politics and culture of the regions he visited. He was a supporter of British imperialism, but he also respected and admired the local traditions and customs. He saw himself as a bridge between two very different worlds, and his ability to speak the local languages and understand the local customs made him an effective diplomat.</p><p>The circumstances of Burnes' death remain controversial. Some historians believe that Burnes was killed because he was seen as a representative of British imperialism, while others argue that he was the victim of a personal vendetta by a member of the royal court. Regardless of the cause, Burnes' death was a major blow to British prestige in Afghanistan and contributed to the outbreak of the First Anglo-Afghan War.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by assassination.
