(January 31, 1881		Brooklyn-August 16, 1957			Woods Hole)


was
an American
scientist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his contributions to the field of surface chemistry and for introducing the concept of "monolayers" (a single layer of atoms or molecules) in surface science. Langmuir also made important contributions to the fields of atomic theory, thermodynamics, and plasma physics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1932 for his work on surface chemistry. Langmuir was a prolific researcher and inventor, holding over 40 patents, and his work has had a lasting impact on science and technology. He was also known for his quirky habits and eccentric personality.</p><p>Langmuir was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1881, and he earned his undergraduate and doctoral degrees in chemistry from Columbia University. In the early part of his career, Langmuir worked at General Electric, where he conducted important research on industrial processes such as the development of gas-filled vacuum tubes. He also worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II, helping to develop the atomic bomb.</p><p>Langmuir was known for his meticulous attention to detail and his ability to design elegant experiments to test his hypotheses. He was also a gifted writer and communicator, and his papers and lectures are still regarded as some of the clearest and most insightful in the field of surface chemistry.</p><p>In addition to his scientific contributions, Langmuir was a passionate advocate for science education and public outreach. He often gave talks and demonstrations to local schools and community groups, and he helped to establish a number of science museums and education programs.</p><p>Langmuir passed away in Woods Hole, Massachusetts in 1957 at the age of 76. He was widely mourned by his colleagues and students, who remembered him not only as a brilliant scientist, but also as a kind and generous mentor who inspired many young people to pursue careers in science.</p><p>Langmuir was also known for his research on the properties of gases and for developing the Langmuir equation, which describes the adsorption of a gas onto a surface. He also discovered the phenomenon of "coagulation," which occurs when droplets of a liquid come together to form larger drops. In addition, Langmuir was a pioneer in the field of plasma physics, and his work laid the foundation for the development of plasma welding and cutting.</p><p>Aside from his scientific endeavors, Langmuir was an accomplished artist and musician. He painted watercolors and played the piano and violin, often performing for his colleagues and friends. He was also an avid outdoorsman and enjoyed hiking and fishing in his free time.</p><p>In recognition of his scientific achievements, Langmuir received numerous awards and honors, including the Perkin Medal and the Elliott Cresson Medal from the Franklin Institute. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. Today, Langmuir's work remains influential in many fields, including materials science, chemistry, and engineering.</p><p>Langmuir's work on surface chemistry was particularly groundbreaking. He discovered that molecules at the surface of liquids or solids behave differently than those in the bulk, paving the way for the development of the modern science of surface science. He also showed that when a thin film is formed on a surface, there is a reduction in surface energy that creates a stable surface, which he called a "monolayer."</p><p>Langmuir's work on plasma physics was also significant, as he was the first to describe what is now known as the "Langmuir probe," a diagnostic tool used to measure temperature, density, and plasma potential. He also developed the Langmuir-Schaefer film deposition technique, which is still widely used today to deposit thin films on surfaces.</p><p>In addition to his scientific research, Langmuir was an important figure in the development of industrial research in the United States. He was a founding member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and he helped establish the GE Research Laboratory, which became a model for industrial research labs around the world.</p><p>Langmuir's legacy is still felt today, both in the scientific community and in popular culture. The "Langmuir isotherm," which describes the behavior of gases at a surface, is a fundamental tool in surface science. Langmuir's work also inspired numerous fictional characters, including Dr. Gustav Aneschi, a brilliant but eccentric scientist from the movie "The Day the Earth Stood Still."</p><p></p><p>

(December 16, 1901		Philadelphia-November 15, 1978			New York City)

	
		a.k.a. Dr. Margaret Mead

	
was
an American
writer, cultural anthropologist, curator, professor, author and anthropologist.


					
			
		She had
		one
		child,
		Mary Catherine Bateson.

						</p><p>Mead was most well-known for her groundbreaking work in the field of cultural anthropology, particularly her studies of gender roles and sexuality in different cultures. She conducted fieldwork in Samoa, Papua New Guinea, and Bali, among other places. Her work challenged traditional notions of gender and sexuality and emphasized the importance of cultural context in shaping these aspects of human life. Mead was also a prolific writer, publishing numerous books and articles throughout her career. In addition to her academic work, Mead was active in promoting public awareness of anthropology and served as a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City for many years.</p><p>Mead's work in cultural anthropology had a significant impact on the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Her 1928 book "Coming of Age in Samoa" challenged the view that adolescence was inevitably a time of turmoil and conflict, arguing instead that it could be a period of relative calm and stability in societies where young people were given greater freedom and responsibility. This idea resonated with many young women in the United States who were rebelling against traditional gender roles and seeking greater autonomy.</p><p>In addition to her academic work, Mead was also an outspoken activist on a number of social and political issues. She was a prominent critic of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and was active in the anti-nuclear movement. She also advocated for greater education and job opportunities for women and for greater respect for indigenous cultures and languages.</p><p>Mead's legacy continues to be felt in the field of anthropology and beyond. Her emphasis on cultural relativism and the importance of understanding other cultures on their own terms has become a central tenet of modern anthropology. Additionally, her advocacy for gender and sexual equality has had a lasting impact on feminist thought and activism.</p><p>Throughout her lifetime, Margaret Mead made significant contributions to the field of cultural anthropology. She received her B.A. from Barnard College and her Ph.D. from Columbia University, where she studied under anthropologist Franz Boas. Mead's research led her to challenge many conventional beliefs about gender roles, family structure, and child-rearing practices. Her work in Samoa, in particular, was controversial and sparked debates about the relationship between culture and human behavior.</p><p>Mead was also a skilled communicator and spread her message through a wide array of media. She was a popular public speaker, a frequent guest on talk shows and radio programs, and an occasional performer on the lecture circuit. She published over twenty books, including her most famous work, "Coming of Age in Samoa," which became a best-seller and a classic in anthropology. Mead was also an active member of the American Association of University Women, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.</p><p>Mead's impact on anthropology and other fields has been profound. She helped to popularize cultural relativism, a concept that stresses the importance of understanding other cultures in their own terms, rather than imposing one's own cultural values on them. Her work also paved the way for the development of feminist anthropology, which examines the relationship between gender, culture, and power. Mead's legacy as a scholar, activist, and public intellectual continues to inspire generations of anthropologists and feminists.</p><p>Despite facing criticism from some in the anthropological community, Margaret Mead remained dedicated to her research and activism throughout her life. She believed strongly in the power of anthropology to promote social change and understanding, and she worked tirelessly to promote these values to a wider audience. In addition to her academic and activist work, Mead was also a beloved teacher and mentor to many students and junior colleagues. She mentored many women in the field of anthropology and was a role model to women and girls seeking to enter non-traditional fields.Meant was also awarded numerous honors and awards throughout her career, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1979, posthumously. Her legacy continues to inspire social scientists, activists, and feminists around the world.</p><p></p><p>
