personality.


					</p><p>He was a prominent painter who specialized in portrait paintings and was renowned for his technical brilliance and use of vibrant colors. Wertmüller was trained in Stockholm and later studied under the tutelage of the famous painter Jacques-Louis David in Paris. He gained international recognition after his painting of Benjamin Franklin was displayed in the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Wertmüller traveled extensively throughout Europe while honing his craft and eventually settled in the United States where he gained wide acclaim as a portrait artist. He was commissioned by many dignitaries and leaders of the time including George Washington, and even painted his wife Martha (one of few portraits done of her during her lifetime). Despite his success in the US, Wertmüller eventually fell on hard times and ended up being buried in an unmarked grave in a small Delaware cemetery.</p><p>Wertmüller's career spanned several decades, and his work reflected the changing styles and tastes of the times. In addition to portraits, he also painted historical and mythological scenes, many of which were influenced by classical antiquity. His most famous works include "Danaë and the Shower of Gold," "Gustav III in 1772," and"The Baker's Daughter".</p><p>Aside from his artistic accomplishments, Wertmüller led an eventful life. He was imprisoned during the French Revolution for sympathizing with the royal family, narrowly escaped being guillotined, and eventually found refuge in the United States where he lived out the rest of his days. Despite his struggles, his legacy as a skilled painter continues to be celebrated, particularly in his native Sweden where his work is still exhibited in museums and galleries.</p><p></p><p>
