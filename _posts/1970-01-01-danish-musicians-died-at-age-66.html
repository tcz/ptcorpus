(May 13, 1588		Aarhus-August 31, 1654			Copenhagen)


was
a Danish
physicist, scientist and physician.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the founding fathers of modern geology for his pioneering work on fossils and minerals. He was also a widely respected physician who served as the personal physician to King Christian IV of Denmark. In addition to his scientific contributions, he was a collector of rare books and manuscripts, and amassed a significant collection of antiquities, coins, and curiosities that formed the basis of the famous Wormianum Museum in Copenhagen. He was a prolific author, publishing works on a wide range of topics including medicine, natural history, and theology. Despite his many accomplishments, he was known to be a somewhat eccentric personality, often dressing in unusual outfits and keeping unusual company. Nonetheless, he left an enduring legacy as one of Denmark's most important scientists and scholars.</p><p>Ole Worm was born into a prominent aristocratic family in Aarhus, Denmark. He received his early education at home from his father, who was a Lutheran bishop. He went on to study medicine and natural sciences at the University of Marburg in Germany, where he was exposed to the latest scientific ideas of the time.</p><p>Upon returning to Denmark, Ole Worm became a professor of medicine at the University of Copenhagen and later became a professor of natural history, a position which he held until his death. He was particularly interested in the study of fossils and rocks, and his research into the structure of the earth led him to develop some of the earliest geological theories. He also contributed to the scientific investigation of the human body, demonstrating a keen interest in anatomy and pathology.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Ole Worm was an avid collector of objects from around the world. His collection, which ultimately formed the basis of the Wormianum Museum, included everything from rare books and manuscripts to exotic specimens of animals and plants. He also collected prehistoric artifacts, which he recognized as being important relics from the distant past.</p><p>Throughout his life, Ole Worm maintained an active interest in theology and philosophy. He was a follower of the German theologian Jacob Boehme, whose mystical ideas influenced his own writing and thought. He saw the study of nature as a means of understanding the divine order of the universe, and he believed that scientific investigation was an essential aspect of religious life.</p><p>Despite his many contributions to the scientific and intellectual communities of his time, Ole Worm was known for his eccentric personality and quixotic behavior. He was known to dress in unusual clothing, wear a long beard, and spend long periods of time alone in his study. Nonetheless, his work helped to lay the groundwork for modern science and his legacy continues to be felt in the fields of geology, natural history, and medicine.</p><p>Ole Worm was also a skilled linguist, fluent in several languages including Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic. This proficiency in foreign languages allowed him to translate and publish important medical and scientific texts, which helped to spread new ideas and discoveries across Europe. In addition to his scholarly pursuits, Ole Worm was also a skilled artist, and he produced a number of detailed illustrations of natural objects and curiosities. These illustrations were included in his published works and helped to bring his research to life for readers.</p><p>Despite his significant contributions to science and academia, Ole Worm's reputation suffered somewhat in the years following his death. He was criticized for his belief in alchemy, and some of his more eccentric beliefs and practices were viewed with suspicion. Nonetheless, his contributions to the fields of geology, natural history, and medicine cannot be overstated, and his legacy continues to be felt today. The Wormianum Museum, which he founded and which bears his name, remains an important cultural institution in Copenhagen, and his writings continue to be studied and appreciated by scholars around the world.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and scholarly pursuits, Ole Worm was also involved in politics and public service. He served as a member of the Danish Parliament for several years, and he was a staunch supporter of King Christian IV, whom he served as a personal physician. Ole Worm also played a role in the development of Copenhagen, and he worked to improve public health and sanitation in the city. He was instrumental in the construction of the city's first public hospital, which was named after him, and he was a strong advocate for the establishment of public parks and green spaces for the benefit of the city's inhabitants. Throughout his life, Ole Worm remained committed to the pursuit of knowledge, and his contributions to the fields of science, medicine, and culture continue to be celebrated to this day.</p><p></p><p>
