(September 16, 1917		Orenburg-July 13, 1943			Munich)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Alexander Schmorell was a key member of the anti-Nazi resistance group called the White Rose, which was active during World War II. Schmorell, along with other members of the White Rose, distributed leaflets throughout Germany, urging citizens to resist against the Nazi regime. He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943 and was sentenced to death. Despite attempts to rescue him, Schmorell was executed by decapitation at Stadelheim Prison in Munich. He has since been recognized as a hero in Germany for his brave resistance against the Nazi regime.</p><p>Schmorell was born in Orenburg, Russia, but his family moved to Germany when he was a child. He was raised in Munich and attended medical school at the University of Munich. It was during his time at university that he became involved in the resistance movement, which was sparked by the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime.</p><p>As a member of the White Rose, Schmorell helped to write and produce anti-Nazi leaflets and distribute them across Munich, risking his own life in the process. He also worked as a medic for the German army during World War II, but he used this position to smuggle out information about the war and distribute it to the resistance.</p><p>Schmorell's execution along with other members of the White Rose was a turning point in the German resistance movement, inspiring others to speak out against the Nazi regime. Today, Schmorell is honored alongside other members of the White Rose as a symbol of resistance against oppression and tyranny, and several schools and streets in Germany have been named after him.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of decapitation.
