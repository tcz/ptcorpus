lawyer, politician, author and military officer.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Julie Nixon Eisenhower and Tricia Nixon Cox.

						</p><p>He served as the 37th President of the United States, from 1969 until 1974. Nixon is known for his involvement in the Watergate scandal, which led to his resignation from the presidency in 1974. Despite this controversy, Nixon had many accomplishments during his time in office, such as establishing diplomatic relations with China and ending the Vietnam War. Before his presidency, Nixon served as Vice President under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. As a young man, he also served in the United States Navy during World War II. After leaving office, Nixon wrote several books and remained active in politics until his death in 1994.</p><p>Nixon had a challenging childhood, marked by his family's poverty and the early deaths of two of his brothers. However, he was a brilliant student and earned a scholarship to attend Whittier College. He then went on to Duke University Law School, where he graduated third in his class. Nixon practiced law for several years before being elected to Congress in 1946. </p><p>Nixon gained national attention as a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he pursued allegations of communist infiltration in the government and entertainment industry. He rose quickly through the political ranks, serving in the Senate and then as Vice President before being elected to the presidency in 1968. </p><p>During his presidency, Nixon worked to expand social programs and signed several landmark environmental laws. He also oversaw the Apollo 11 moon landing and implemented a policy of detente with the Soviet Union. However, his reputation was forever tarnished by the Watergate scandal, in which he and his administration were found to have engaged in illegal activities, including wiretapping and the burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters. </p><p>After resigning from the presidency, Nixon largely retreated from public life. He wrote several critically-acclaimed books, including his memoirs and a study of foreign policy, and traveled extensively around the world. Nixon also continued to be involved in American politics through his writing and speeches, and remained a controversial figure until his death in 1994.</p><p>Additionally, Nixon was a skilled debater and campaigned tirelessly for his political party. He was known for his aggressive, no-nonsense style and his ability to connect with everyday Americans. He was reelected in a landslide victory in 1972, winning 49 out of 50 states. However, the Watergate scandal soon overshadowed his accomplishments and led to his resignation, making him the only U.S. president to have ever resigned from office. Nixon's legacy remains mixed, with some praising his foreign policy achievements and others condemning his abuses of power. Despite this, he remains a significant figure in American political history and is regularly studied by scholars and political analysts.</p><p>Nixon was also a fervent anti-communist and believed in the need for strong national defense. He escalated the war in Vietnam, leading to increased protests and social unrest in the United States. In addition to his political accomplishments, Nixon was also an avid musician and played the piano, accordion, and violin. He enjoyed listening to classical music and was a fan of composer Johann Sebastian Bach. Nixon was married to his wife, Pat Nixon, for 53 years before her death in 1993. The couple met while in college, and Pat was a popular first lady known for her charm and grace. Despite his controversial legacy, Nixon's contributions to American politics and international relations continue to be studied and analyzed to this day.</p><p></p><p>
