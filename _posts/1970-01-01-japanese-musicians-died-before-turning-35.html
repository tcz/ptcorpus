was
a Japanese
scientist and mathematician.


					</p><p>Despite his short life, Taniyama made significant contributions to the field of arithmetic geometry. He is known for the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, which establishes a connection between elliptic curves and modular forms.

Taniyama's work has had a profound impact on modern number theory, and he continues to be celebrated as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century.</p><p>Taniyama was born in Kisai, Japan and grew up in a family of seven children. His father worked as a schoolteacher and had a strong interest in mathematics, which he instilled in his son from a young age. Taniyama attended Tokyo University where he studied mathematics and developed his interest in number theory. He graduated with a degree in mathematics in 1950 and went on to pursue graduate studies at the University of Tokyo.</p><p>During his graduate studies, Taniyama began to focus on arithmetic geometry, a field that investigates the connections between geometry and number theory. In 1955, he introduced the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, which implied that all elliptic curves can be associated with modular forms. This conjecture remained unsolved for many years until Andrew Wiles proved it in the early 1990s as part of his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.</p><p>Unfortunately, Taniyama's life was cut short when he committed suicide at the age of 31. The exact reasons for his suicide remain unknown. Despite his tragically short life, Taniyama's contributions to mathematics have had a profound impact on the field and continue to influence research to this day. In recognition of his achievements, the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture is sometimes referred to as the Taniyama-Shimura-Tate conjecture.</p><p>In addition to his work in arithmetic geometry, Taniyama also made contributions to other areas of mathematics such as algebraic geometry and topology. He collaborated with fellow mathematician Goro Shimura on several papers, including one on the theory of complex multiplication. Taniyama was known for his creativity and intuition in mathematics, and his ideas often led to breakthroughs in the field.</p><p>Today, Taniyama is widely recognized as one of the most brilliant mathematicians of the 20th century. His name is commemorated in several ways, including the Taniyama group in algebraic topology and the Taniyama-Kajiwara theorem in number theory. The Taniyama Memorial Prize, administered by the Japan Mathematical Society, is awarded annually to young mathematicians who have made significant contributions to the field.</p><p></p><p>
