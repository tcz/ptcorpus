He began his career as a cellist, playing in various orchestras including the New York City Opera and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Shulman later turned to composition and his works were performed by many notable orchestras including the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He also wrote music for films and television, including scores for the classic TV series "The Twilight Zone". Later in life, Shulman became a prominent teacher and mentor, serving on the faculty at the Manhattan School of Music for many years.</p><p>Shulman's compositions were influenced by a variety of styles, including jazz, folk, and classical music. He was known for his use of unique instrumental combinations and his incorporation of innovative rhythms and harmonies in his pieces. Some of his notable works include his cello concerto, string quartet, and "A Laurentian Overture". Shulman was honored with numerous awards throughout his career, including the ASCAP Deems Taylor Award and the National Endowment for the Arts Grant. Additionally, he held memberships in several music organizations, including the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) and the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Even after his passing in 2002, Shulman's contributions to American music continue to be celebrated and recognized.</p><p>In addition to his many accomplishments, Alan Shulman was a part of many prominent musical collaborations throughout his career.

He served as the president of the American Music Center and worked to promote the works of younger, emerging composers.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, however, Shulman remained humble about his contributions to music. In an interview, he once said, "I've made some contributions, but they're drops in the ocean. The great contributions come from people like Bach and Beethoven, and I don't put myself in their category at all." Nevertheless, he remains an important figure in the world of American classical music and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of composers and performers.</p><p>Shulman also had a strong passion for music education and was involved in numerous programs throughout his career.

The award was established in his honor and serves as a testament to his many contributions to the field of music. In addition to his prestigious career, Shulman is remembered for his kindness, generosity, and unwavering dedication to his craft.</p><p>Shulman was also a prolific writer and contributed many articles to music publications throughout his career. He was known for his insightful commentary on contemporary classical music and his willingness to discuss controversial topics in the field. Shulman was also an accomplished conductor, leading performances with various orchestras and ensembles throughout his career.</p><p>Despite experiencing hearing loss in his later years, Shulman continued to compose and perform music until the end of his life. He believed that music was a universal language that could bring people together and inspire positive change in the world. Shulman's unwavering passion for music and his dedication to teaching and promoting the works of emerging composers continue to influence the world of classical music today.</p><p></p><p>
