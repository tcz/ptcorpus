(March 17, 1347		Siena-April 29, 1380			Rome)

	
		otherwise known as St. Catherine of Siena or Catherine Benincasa

	
was
an Italian
writer, physician and philosopher.


					</p><p>She was the 25th child in her family and received no formal education. At the age of 7, Catherine had a mystical experience in which she saw Jesus seated in glory with the Apostles Peter, Paul, and John. </p><p>At the age of 16, Catherine joined the Third Order of Saint Dominic and devoted herself to a life of prayer and service to the poor and sick. She also became known for her letters, which were filled with theological insights and spiritual counsel. These letters were often addressed to high-ranking church officials and political leaders, and her influence grew as her reputation spread.</p><p>In 1377, Catherine traveled to Avignon to convince Pope Gregory XI to return the papacy to Rome from its residence in Avignon. She was successful, and the papacy was restored to Rome in 1378. </p><p>Catherine died in Rome at the age of 33 and was canonized in 1461. She is one of only four women to hold the title of Doctor of the Church, a designation given to individuals whose writings have significantly impacted theology and doctrine.</p><p>Catherine was known for her deep prayer life, which included intense periods of fasting and self-mortification. She also had a reputation for her ability to heal the sick and comfort the dying. Catherine's devotion to the Catholic Church and her mystical experiences led her to be a key player in the Avignon Papacy crisis, which saw the papacy move from Rome to Avignon in France. Catherine was instrumental in convincing Gregory XI to return the Papacy to Rome from its residence in Avignon. Her influence on the Church went beyond just the Avignon Papacy crisis, as she also played a role in the Great Schism of the Catholic Church, which began in 1378.</p><p>Catherine of Siena was heavily involved in politics and actively engaged in influencing decisions related to the Church. She wrote letters to kings, princes, and even the Pope, advising them on various issues. Catherine also denounced corruption within the Church and called for reform, which earned her many critics but also made her popular among the people. She is known for her famous quote, "Be who God meant you to be and you will set the world on fire." Catherine of Siena's feast day is celebrated on April 29th. She is the patron saint of fire prevention, illness, miscarriages, people ridiculed for their faith, and Italy.</p><p></p><p>

					</p><p>Valentino was a prominent figure in the silent film era and became known as a sex symbol due to his dark, exotic looks and seductive on-screen presence. He appeared in popular films such as "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse", "Blood and Sand", and "The Son of the Sheik". He was one of the highest-paid actors of his time and was considered a matinee idol. Valentino was also a trained dancer and often incorporated dance into his film roles. He was married twice, first to actress Jean Acker and then to Natacha Rambova, a costume and set designer. Despite his success on-screen, Valentino faced discrimination and bullying due to his immigrant background and effeminate appearance. His untimely death at the age of 31 sparked widespread public mourning and resulted in numerous conspiracy theories about the cause of his sudden illness.</p><p>Valentino was born in Italy and immigrated to the United States in 1913.

(August 5, 1906		Catania-March 27, 1938)


was
an Italian
physicist.


					</p><p>He is known for his work on neutrino masses, the Majorana equation, and the Majorana fermion. Majorana was the youngest of four children born to a Sicilian family of aristocratic heritage. He studied physics at the University of Rome, where he worked under Enrico Fermi. After completing his studies, Majorana became a professor at the University of Naples. He disappeared under mysterious circumstances during a boat trip from Palermo to Naples in March of 1938, and his fate remains unknown. Despite his early death, Majorana's contributions to the fields of physics and mathematics continue to be studied and applied to this day.</p><p>During his time at the University of Rome, Majorana worked with Nobel Laureate Enrico Fermi on a theory of beta decay. Out of this work came the Majorana equation, which describes particles that are their own antiparticles. This work was groundbreaking and established Majorana as a leading figure in his field.</p><p>Majorana also proposed the idea of neutrino masses, which were later confirmed experimentally. He also developed the concept of the Majorana fermion, a particle that could be used in quantum computing.</p><p>Despite his achievements, Majorana was known for being reclusive and secretive. After his disappearance, many theories emerged about what may have happened to him, from suicide to him simply choosing to disappear. To this day, his fate remains a mystery.</p><p>Nevertheless, Majorana continues to be regarded as a brilliant physicist who made crucial contributions to understanding the nature of particles and their interactions. His work has continued to inspire research in the field of physics and beyond, and he remains an important figure in the study of particle physics.</p><p>In addition to his work in physics, Ettore Majorana was also proficient in mathematics and philosophy. He wrote several papers on these subjects, including a paper on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics.</p><p>Despite his reputed reclusiveness, Majorana was known to be a gifted teacher and mentor. He had a small group of students whom he worked closely with, including Franco Rasetti and Bruno Pontecorvo, both of whom went on to have successful careers in physics.</p><p>Majorana's disappearance remains one of the most intriguing unsolved mysteries in the history of physics. Several books and documentaries have been produced on the topic, with many theories positing that he may have been the victim of foul play, or that he may have chosen to disappear and start a new life elsewhere.</p><p>Regardless of the circumstances of his disappearance, Ettore Majorana's contributions to the fields of physics and mathematics continue to be studied and admired by scientists and enthusiasts alike. His work has had a lasting impact on our understanding of the universe and the fundamental building blocks of matter.</p><p></p><p>

(September 7, 1900		Ferruzzano-March 20, 1933			Union Correctional Institution)


was
an Italian
bricklayer.


					</p><p>Giuseppe Zangara gained notoriety for his attempted assassination of then-president-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 15, 1933. Zangara was targeting Roosevelt, but ended up wounding five people, including Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who eventually succumbed to his injuries. Zangara was quickly apprehended and sentenced to death. During his trial, Zangara claimed that he had been trying to kill any president, not just Roosevelt, and that he was motivated to do so by his chronic stomach pains. Despite widespread public sympathy for his suffering, Zangara was executed by electric chair less than a month after his arrest.</p><p>Giuseppe Zangara was born in a small village in Italy and immigrated to the United States in 1923. He settled in Patterson, New Jersey, where he worked as a bricklayer. Zangara struggled with poverty and was often unable to afford medical treatment for his chronic stomach pains. He believed that his suffering was the result of the capitalist system and became increasingly radicalized, leading to his assassination attempt on Roosevelt. </p><p>Zangara's actions highlighted the security vulnerabilities of political figures and led to the Secret Service's increased involvement in protecting presidents. Cermak's death resulted in changes to security protocols for political events. </p><p>Despite his short-lived notoriety, Zangara remains a relatively obscure figure in history. However, his actions serve as a reminder of how political violence can be fueled by personal struggles and beliefs.</p><p>Zangara's execution was witnessed by a reporter from the Chicago Tribune, who famously remarked that "nobody cheered, nobody prayed, nobody cried. There was only silence." Zangara's body was later returned to Italy, where his family was initially denied permission to bury him. Eventually, his body was buried in his hometown of Ferruzzano. The incident also led to a conspiracy theory that Cermak was the intended target and Roosevelt was an accidental victim, but this theory has been widely debunked. In addition to the increased security measures put in place after the incident, Zangara's attempted assassination also prompted a discussion about the need for healthcare reform in the United States. Today, Zangara is often remembered as a tragic figure whose actions were driven by desperation and illness.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of capital punishment.

(October 19, 1882		Reggio Calabria-August 17, 1916			Verona)


was
an Italian
painter, artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He was one of the founders of the Futurism movement in art, which celebrated technology, speed and dynamism. Boccioni's most famous works include "The City Rises" and "Unique Forms of Continuity in Space". He was also a writer and published several theoretical essays on modern art. Boccioni was tragically killed while serving in World War I, cutting short a promising career and depriving the art world of a major talent.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to the Futurism movement, Boccioni was also heavily influenced by the work of Paul Cézanne and Vincent van Gogh. He studied art in Rome, Milan and Venice, where he met fellow Futurist artists like Filippo Marinetti and Carlo Carrà. Boccioni believed that art should not merely imitate reality, but rather capture the essence of movement and energy. This philosophy is evident in his famous sculpture "Unique Forms of Continuity in Space", which depicts a human figure in motion. Boccioni's legacy has inspired generations of artists and continues to influence the world of modern art today.</p><p>Despite his brief career, Boccioni was a prolific artist and produced a wide range of works in various mediums such as painting, sculpture, and architecture. He also experimented with photography and film, which were relatively new mediums during his time. In addition to his own work, Boccioni played a key role in organizing and curating exhibitions of Futurist art both in Italy and abroad. He was also involved in politics and was a vocal supporter of Italian nationalism and the Fascist regime.</p><p>Boccioni's influence extended beyond the art world and into the fields of design and architecture. His ideas on dynamic movement and the integration of art into everyday life were embraced by modernist architects and designers such as Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius. Boccioni's designs for public buildings and monuments were never realized due to his premature death, but his visionary ideas have continued to inspire architects and artists alike.</p><p>Today, Boccioni's works are part of the permanent collections of major museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Tate Modern in London, and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. His legacy as a pioneer of modern art and visionary thinker continues to inspire and influence contemporary art and culture.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1585		Taurisano-February 9, 1619			Toulouse)


was
an Italian
astrologer.


					</p><p>Vanini was also a philosopher and a scholar of natural science. He is known for his controversial writings, which often promoted atheism and challenged traditional religious beliefs. Vanini believed that the universe was governed by natural laws, rather than divine intervention. He was known for his bold and controversial views on religion, which ultimately led to his arrest and execution by the Inquisition in 1619. Despite his controversial beliefs, Vanini's works have had a significant impact on the development of modern science and philosophy.</p><p>Vanini was born in a small town in southern Italy and received his early education from the Jesuits. He later attended the University of Padua, where he began to develop his interest in natural science and astronomy. After completing his studies, he moved to France, where he gained a reputation as a skilled astrologer and became a popular lecturer at the University of Toulouse.</p><p>Vanini's most famous work was "De Admirandis Naturae Reginae Deaeque Mortalium Arcanis", or "Concerning the Secrets of the Queen of the Natural and Mortal Gods". The book, which was published in 1616, was a controversial critique of traditional Christian beliefs and argued that the universe was a self-sufficient system that did not require any divine intervention.</p><p>Vanini was arrested in 1618 on charges of blasphemy and atheism. He was subjected to a long and grueling trial by the Inquisition, during which he refused to recant his views. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by burning at the stake. Vanini's execution made him a martyr for the cause of free thought and religious tolerance, and his ideas continued to influence the development of European philosophy and science for centuries.</p><p>Vanini's ideas and writings were not only deemed heretical by the church, but also challenged conventional thinking in the scientific community. In addition to his beliefs on natural laws governing the universe, he also rejected the Aristotelian view of the four elements and instead proposed a theory of a continuous substance that could transform into different forms. Vanini was also one of the first to propose a theory of the evolution of species, centuries before Charles Darwin published "On the Origin of Species."</p><p>Despite his controversial ideas and untimely death, Vanini's impact on the scientific and philosophical world cannot be denied. His works were rare and difficult to obtain, but they inspired a generation of free thinkers and influenced the Age of Enlightenment. In the 19th century, Vanini was rediscovered by scholars and his writings were republished and studied extensively. Today, he is recognized as one of the most important and influential philosophers of the early modern period.</p><p></p><p>
