						</p><p>Jayavarman IV was a prominent king of the Khmer Empire who reigned from 928 to 941 CE. He is best remembered for his construction of the temple city of Koh Ker, a site located about 75 kilometers north of Angkor near the present-day city of Preah Vihear. This site, which served as the capital of the Khmer Empire during his reign, houses several impressive monuments and temples, including the famous Prasat Thom temple pyramid.</p><p>Jayavarman IV was born into a family of Khmer aristocrats and was educated at the royal court of Angkor. He is believed to have been a devout follower of the Hindu god Shiva and his temple at Koh Ker was dedicated to this deity. During his reign, he oversaw a period of significant architectural and artistic activity, which is reflected in the elaborate designs and imagery found in the temples at Koh Ker.</p><p>In addition to his architectural legacy, Jayavarman IV was also known for his military prowess.

He is credited with consolidating power in the northern provinces of the empire and establishing Koh Ker as an important center of trade and commerce. The temple city he built there was a marvel of engineering and architecture, with towering pyramids, ornate carvings, and intricate sculptures decorating the structures.</p><p>Despite his military success and architectural achievements, Jayavarman IV's reign was short-lived. He was succeeded by his son Harshavarman I, who ruled for only four years before being assassinated. The subsequent period of instability and political turmoil in the Khmer Empire contributed to the decline and eventual collapse of the civilization.</p><p>Today, the temples at Koh Ker are a popular destination for tourists and history enthusiasts who want to explore the rich cultural heritage of Southeast Asia.
