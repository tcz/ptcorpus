(June 7, 1944		Kinston-)

	
		otherwise known as Parker, Melvin

	
is
an American
drummer and musician.


						</p><p>He is best known for his work with James Brown in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Parker began playing drums at a young age and grew up in a musical family. In 1962, Parker joined James Brown's band as a drummer and quickly became an integral part of the group's sound. He played on several of Brown's classic hits, including "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" and "I Got You (I Feel Good)." Parker's tight, precise drumming style helped to define the funk genre and influenced countless other drummers. After leaving James Brown's band in the early 1970s, Parker went on to work with a variety of other musicians, including George Clinton and Bootsy Collins. He continues to perform and record music to this day.</p><p>In addition to his work as a drummer, Melvin Parker was also a songwriter and producer. He co-wrote several songs with James Brown, including "Talkin' Loud and Saying Nothing" and "Bodyheat." Parker also produced albums for a number of artists, including Maceo Parker (his brother), Lyn Collins, and Fred Wesley. </p><p>Parker's drumming has been highly praised by fellow musicians and critics alike. His style, characterized by sharp snare hits and tightly syncopated rhythms, helped to define the funk sound and has influenced countless other drummers. In recognition of his contributions to music, Parker was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society's Hall of Fame in 2012. </p><p>Despite experiencing health issues later in life, Parker continued to perform and record music well into his seventies. In 2020, he released a new album, "It's All About Love," which features collaborations with a number of other acclaimed musicians. Despite his fame and success, Parker has remained humble and is known for his friendly, down-to-earth demeanor.</p><p>Parker's musical talent runs in the family. He is the brother of saxophonist Maceo Parker and trombonist Fred Wesley, both of whom also worked with James Brown. The three eventually formed their own band, The Maceo Parker Band, which toured extensively in the 1990s and 2000s. Melvin Parker also played a major role in developing the "James Brown sound," which was characterized by its tight instrumentals and explosive, high-energy performances. Parker's drumming was a key part of that sound, and he helped to create some of Brown's most enduring hits. Despite his success, Parker has remained grounded and focused on his craft. He once said in an interview, "I'm not in it for the glory. I'm in it for the music." Parker continues to be an influential figure in the world of drumming and is widely considered one of the most important drummers of his generation.</p><p>Aside from his notable contributions to music, Melvin Parker also made significant strides in the field of education. In 2013, he became a music professor at Florida A&M University, where he has taught percussion and drum set. Parker has also conducted drum clinics and workshops around the world, sharing his knowledge and experience with aspiring musicians. Through his teaching, Parker has helped to inspire a new generation of drummers and musicians. He is also committed to giving back to his community and has been involved in several philanthropic initiatives throughout his career. Parker's legacy as a drummer, songwriter, producer, educator, and philanthropist continues to inspire and influence people around the world.</p><p></p><p>
