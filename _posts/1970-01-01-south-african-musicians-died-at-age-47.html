Washkansky had suffered from debilitating heart disease for years and the groundbreaking surgery was his only chance at survival.

Nevertheless, his surgery paved the way for future heart transplants and helped make South Africa a leader in the field of medical research.</p><p>Louis Washkansky was born in Lithuania in 1913 and moved to South Africa with his family as a child. Prior to his heart transplant, he worked as a businessman and had a wife and children.

The operation was highly controversial at the time and sparked ethical debates surrounding the transplant of human organs. In the years following Washkansky's surgery, medical advancements continued to improve the success rate of heart transplants, leading to more patients being able to benefit from this life-saving procedure. Today, heart transplants are a well-established treatment for certain conditions, with thousands of successful operations performed each year.
