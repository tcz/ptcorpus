									</h1><p>Here are 21 famous musicians from Italy died at 73:</p><h2>Vincenzo Giustiniani</h2><p><strong>Vincenzo Giustiniani</strong>
(September 13, 1564		Chios-December 27, 1637			Rome)


was
an Italian
banker.


					</p><p>He was born to a wealthy family in Chios, an island in Greece, which was then under the rule of the Genoese. He moved to Rome in his youth and became a prominent banker and patron of the arts. He was a great collector of art, with a particular interest in ancient Greek and Roman sculptures. His collection included works by Raphael, Titian, Caravaggio, and Rubens. </p><p>Giustiniani was also a significant figure in the Catholic Church, and his wealth and influence allowed him to support numerous religious institutions, including the erection of the Church of Santa Maria della Passione in Rome. He was closely associated with Pope Urban VIII, who showered him with honors and privileges, including making him a Marquis. </p><p>Giustiniani was known for his generosity and philanthropy and has been described as one of the wealthiest and most cultured men of his time. His legacy lives on through his extensive art collection, which was eventually acquired by the French statesman Cardinal Mazarin and later became part of the Louvre Museum's collection.</p><p>Giustiniani was also a noted scholar and writer, and his works on astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy were highly regarded during his time. He maintained close relationships with several prominent artists, including Caravaggio, who painted a portrait of him in 1605. Giustiniani played a key role in the art world of his era, acting as a patron to many of the most important artists of the time, including Guido Reni and Nicolas Poussin.</p><p>Despite his success and prominence, however, Giustiniani was not immune to tragedy. His wife and four children all passed away before him, leaving him to dedicate much of his later life to his philanthropic efforts. He died in Rome at the age of 73, leaving behind a legacy of artistic patronage and philanthropy that continues to inspire to this day.</p><p>In addition to his extensive art collection, Vincenzo Giustiniani is also known for his contributions to music. He was a skilled musician himself, playing the lute and composing his own music. He also sponsored concerts and operas, and was instrumental in the development of the genre known as the oratorio. Giustiniani was a strong supporter of the Roman school of music, a style that focused on vocal harmonies and was associated with the Catholic Church. His patronage helped to establish the careers of many prominent composers, including Giacomo Carissimi and Luigi Rossi.</p><p>Giustiniani was also a prominent figure in the political and economic spheres of his time. He served as an advisor to several Popes and was involved in a number of banking and commercial ventures throughout Europe. He was known for his philanthropic endeavors, which often focused on improving the lives of the less fortunate. He funded hospitals and orphanages, and launched several initiatives aimed at alleviating poverty and promoting education.</p><p>Giustiniani's legacy continues to be celebrated today, both for his contributions to the arts and to society as a whole. His art collection remains one of the most important in the world, and his philanthropic spirit continues to inspire others to make a difference in their communities.</p><p>Giustiniani's impact on the art world extended beyond collecting and patronage. He also played a key role in the development of art theory and criticism. Giustiniani was an early advocate for the study of ancient Greek and Roman art, and his writings on the subject helped to shape the field of art history. He was one of the first to propose that art should be studied and analyzed on its own terms, rather than judged solely on its religious or moral content. This approach to art criticism paved the way for the more modern discipline of art history and remains influential to this day.</p><p>In addition to his many accomplishments, Giustiniani's life was also marked by controversy. He was accused of embezzlement at one point and spent time in jail, though he was eventually cleared of all charges. He was also known for his rivalry with fellow art collector and patron, Cardinal Scipione Borghese. The two men were known to compete fiercely for works of art, and their rivalry is said to have been one of the factors leading to the development of the modern art market.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Giustiniani remained committed to his philanthropic pursuits until the end of his life. He continued to support charitable causes and to advocate for the arts and sciences until his death in 1637. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures of his time, a man whose passion for the arts and for philanthropy left an indelible mark on the world.</p><p>In addition to his many accomplishments, Giustiniani was also a skilled linguist, fluent in several languages including Greek, Latin, Italian, and French. This linguistic ability proved invaluable in his role as a banker and diplomat, as it allowed him to communicate easily with clients and colleagues from across Europe. He was also known for his love of literature, and his extensive library contained works by some of the greatest writers of antiquity as well as many modern authors.</p><p>Giustiniani's philanthropy extended beyond helping the less fortunate. He was also deeply committed to the preservation of cultural heritage and worked tirelessly to protect ancient monuments and artifacts. He was a key figure in the excavation and restoration of the Roman Forum, funding several archaeological expeditions and spearheading efforts to conserve the area for future generations.</p><p>Giustiniani's impact on the art world can still be seen today, with many of the works he collected on display in some of the world's most prestigious museums. His legacy as a philanthropist and patron of the arts continues to inspire generations of artists and philanthropists alike, and he is remembered as a true Renaissance man, whose passions and accomplishments spanned multiple fields of study and inquiry.</p><p></p><p>

		otherwise known as Alessio, Alessio (Alesso) Baldovinetti or Baldovinetti, Alessio

	
was
an Italian
painter.


					</p><p>He was a prolific artist who was active during the early Renaissance period. Baldovinetti is known for his frescoes, altarpieces, and portraits, which showcase his great skill in composition, perspective, and color. Some of his most famous works include the frescoes in the Chapel of the Cardinal of Portugal, the altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin, and the portrait of Federico III da Montefeltro. Additionally, Baldovinetti was a renowned teacher and mentor to other notable artists of his time, such as Domenico Ghirlandaio and Andrea del Verrocchio. Baldovinetti's contributions to the art world continue to be celebrated and studied today for their influence on the development of Renaissance art.</p><p>Baldovinetti was born into a family of artists and began his career as an apprentice to his father, a painter and gilder. He then went on to work in the studio of the painter Antonio Pollaiuolo, where he honed his skills in drawing and painting. Baldovinetti was heavily influenced by the techniques and style of the Florentine School, particularly the work of Fra Angelico and Masaccio.</p><p>In addition to his artistic pursuits, Baldovinetti was also a scholar and studied mathematics, optics, and anatomy. He incorporated his understanding of these subjects into his paintings, creating realistic depictions of the human form and using perspective to create depth and space in his compositions.</p><p>Baldovinetti's legacy is also notable for his involvement in the conservation of art. He was one of the first artists to advocate for the preservation of ancient Roman frescoes and contributed to the development of methods for restoring and repairing damaged paintings.

The painting is notable for its brilliant colors and intricate details, which showcase Baldovinetti's mastery of the medium.</p><p>Despite his significant contributions to the world of art, Baldovinetti's work was largely overshadowed by his contemporaries such as Sandro Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci. However, in recent years his work has been reappraised and celebrated for its technical brilliance and historical importance.</p><p>Baldovinetti's career was not limited to painting and teaching. He also worked as an architect and designed several churches and buildings in Florence. However, very few of his architectural works survive today. One of his most notable works as an architect was the redesign of the Church of Santa Trinita in Florence, which he worked on with his mentor, Antonio Pollaiuolo.</p><p>Baldovinetti was also known for his interest in fashion and textiles. He designed several tapestries, including one depicting the Death of the Virgin, which was commissioned by the powerful Medici family. His tapestries were highly sought after and were considered luxurious and expensive.</p><p>Despite his success, Baldovinetti's personal life remains largely unknown. He never married and lived with his mother for most of his life. It is said that he was a devout Catholic and that his piousness influenced his art. He died in Florence in 1499 at the age of 74 and was buried in the Church of Santa Maria Novella.</p><p>Baldovinetti's influence on the art world continued long after his death, as he was considered an important link between the early Renaissance and the High Renaissance period. His adherence to the principles of perspective and mathematical precision in his paintings were echoed by later artists such as Raphael and Michelangelo. Additionally, his dedication to the preservation and restoration of art has had a lasting impact on the field of conservation.Baldovinetti's legacy can be seen in the many museums and galleries around the world that house his works, including the Uffizi Gallery in Florence and the National Gallery in London. His masterful use of color, composition, and perspective continue to inspire and captivate viewers to this day, cementing his place in art history as one of the great masters of the Renaissance period.</p><p></p><p>

(November 6, 1835		Verona-October 19, 1909			Turin)

	
		a.k.a. Dr. Cesare Lombroso

	
was
an Italian
physician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering work in the field of criminology and is often called the "father of modern criminology." Lombroso believed that criminals were born, not made, and that criminal behavior could be identified by physical characteristics, such as a sloping forehead or asymmetrical face. </p><p>Lombroso also made significant contributions to the fields of psychiatry and anthropology. He wrote several books on these subjects, including "The Man of Genius" and "The Female Offender." In addition to his academic work, Lombroso was also actively involved in politics and social reform, advocating for better treatment of prisoners and the mentally ill.</p><p>Despite his controversial theories, Lombroso's work had a significant impact on the field of criminology and his ideas continue to be studied and debated to this day.</p><p>Lombroso was born into a prosperous Jewish family in Verona, Italy. He studied medicine at the University of Pavia and served as a military doctor before becoming a professor of forensic medicine and hygiene at the University of Turin. Lombroso conducted extensive research on criminals, studying their behavior, physical characteristics, and brain anatomy. He published his findings in a series of books and articles, including "Criminal Man" and "The Delinquent Man." Lombroso's theories were controversial and sparked heated debates, with critics accusing him of racism and pseudoscience. Despite this, Lombroso's work influenced the development of criminology and his legacy continues to shape our understanding of criminal behavior. Lombroso also played a significant role in the history of psychiatry, advocating for more humane treatment of the mentally ill and developing innovative therapies for their care.</p><p>Lombroso's interest in anthropology led him to study different cultures and their customs, beliefs, and practices. He was particularly fascinated by the ways in which primitive societies approached crime and punishment. Lombroso's anthropological research informed his criminological theories and helped him develop a more nuanced understanding of criminal behavior. Lombroso was also politically active and advocated for a number of social reforms, including women's suffrage and workers' rights. He supported the Italian socialist movement and ran for parliament in 1900, but was not elected. Lombroso's work had a profound impact on the field of criminology, influencing generations of researchers and contributing to the development of new theories and perspectives. Although some of his theories have been discredited over time, Lombroso's contributions to the field of criminology remain significant and continue to be studied and debated by scholars around the world.</p><p>In his later years, Lombroso became deeply interested in psychical research, the scientific investigation of paranormal phenomena. He believed that his work in criminology had prepared him well for this field, as he had developed a keen sense of observation and learned to question conventional wisdom. Lombroso was convinced that psychic phenomena were worthy of scientific inquiry and spent much of his time studying mediums, clairvoyants, and other supposed psychics. Lombroso's writings on psychical research, collected in a book titled "After Death—What?", were influential in the early development of the field. Lombroso died of a heart attack in 1909, at the age of 73. He left behind a rich legacy of research and scholarship that continues to shape our understanding of criminal behavior, psychiatry, and psychical phenomena.</p><p>In addition to his academic and political pursuits, Cesare Lombroso was also an accomplished artist. He enjoyed painting and drawing throughout his life and even illustrated some of his own books. Lombroso's artistic interests informed his scientific work, as he believed that studying the human body and its various forms was crucial to understanding criminal behavior. Lombroso's artwork has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world and is still admired for its technical skill and creativity. Lombroso's eclectic interests and broad range of contributions have made him a fascinating figure in the history of science and culture.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1792-April 5, 1865)


was
an Italian
scientist.


					</p><p>Antinori devoted his life to the study of zoology and, in particular, to the study of reptiles and amphibians. He is credited with discovering several new species of reptiles, including the Calabaria reinhardtii, which is commonly known as the Boa of Madagascar. Antinori was also a professor of zoology at the University of Naples and played an instrumental role in the founding of the Naples Zoological Station. In addition to his scientific pursuits, Antinori was a prominent figure in Italian politics and was elected to the Italian Senate in 1860. Despite his many achievements, Antinori faced significant criticism from his contemporaries for his unorthodox views on evolution and his rejection of traditional Christian beliefs.</p><p>Antinori's interest in zoology began at a young age, and by the time he was a teenager, he was already studying and collecting reptiles and amphibians. He continued his studies at the University of Naples, where he received a degree in natural sciences in 1819. After graduation, he held several teaching and research positions at the university before being appointed professor of zoology in 1832.</p><p>Antinori's research was not limited to reptiles and amphibians. He also conducted studies on various other animals, including birds and mammals. His work on the classification of mammals was particularly significant, and he is credited with organizing the first comprehensive collection of mammalian specimens in Italy.</p><p>In addition to his scientific pursuits and political career, Antinori was an avid traveler, and he undertook several expeditions to study animals in their natural habitats. He traveled extensively throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia, and his observations of the fauna and flora of these regions contributed significantly to the scientific knowledge of the time.</p><p>Antinori's impact on the field of zoology was significant, and his contributions continue to be recognized today. The species of reptile Amphiglossus antinorii is named in his honor, as are several other animal species. His extensive collection of specimens is now housed at the Museum of Zoology at the University of Naples, where it remains an important resource for researchers and students in the field.</p><p>Antinori was also known for his pioneering work in the field of herpetology, the study of amphibians and reptiles. He was one of the first scientists to use photography to document his observations, as well as to use preserved specimens for his studies. Antinori's methods were ahead of his time, and his techniques have since become standard practices in the field of zoology.</p><p>Antinori was also a prolific writer, and he published many influential papers and books throughout his career. His most famous work, "Erpetologia Sicula," was a comprehensive treatise on the reptiles of Sicily and is still considered a seminal work in the field.</p><p>Despite facing criticism for his unorthodox views, Antinori remained steadfast in his beliefs and continued to push the boundaries of scientific knowledge throughout his life. He died in Naples in 1865, leaving behind a legacy of scientific discovery and innovation that continues to inspire generations of scientists today.</p><p>Antinori's legacy extends beyond his scientific contributions. He was a strong advocate for the preservation of wildlife and played a key role in shaping the conservation movement in Italy. He recognized the importance of protecting endangered species and their habitats, and he was instrumental in establishing several protected areas in the country. In addition, Antinori was a vocal opponent of animal cruelty and was a driving force behind the passage of laws to protect animals from mistreatment.</p><p>Antinori's achievements were not only recognized in Italy but also internationally. He was a member of several prestigious scientific societies, including the Royal Society of London and the Zoological Society of Paris. He received numerous awards and honors throughout his life, including the Gold Medal of the Société Zoologique de France, and he was a frequent collaborator with other prominent scientists of his time.</p><p>Despite facing criticism for his unorthodox views on evolution and religion, Antinori remained a respected and influential figure in Italian society until his death. He was widely regarded as one of the greatest zoologists of his time and his legacy continues to inspire scholars and researchers in the field today.</p><p>Antinori's impact on the field of zoology was often compared to that of his contemporaries, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. While Darwin and Wallace are better known for their work on the theory of evolution, Antinori's contributions to the study of animal diversity and classification were equally significant. In fact, Antinori's views on evolution were not as unorthodox as his critics suggested. He recognized the concept of common ancestry and the role of natural selection in shaping species over time. However, he believed that a divine force was ultimately responsible for the origin of life on Earth, a view that was inconsistent with Darwin's theory.</p><p>Antinori's advocacy for the protection of wildlife and his opposition to animal cruelty were also ahead of his time. He recognized the importance of preserving biodiversity and the ecological balance of ecosystems, long before these concepts became popular in mainstream discourse. His legacy in this regard is still felt in Italy, where he is considered a pioneer in the conservation movement.</p><p>Overall, Antinori's life and work demonstrate the complex interplay between science, religion, and politics in the 19th century. His legacy reminds us of the importance of intellectual curiosity, innovation, and critical thinking in advancing human knowledge and improving our relationship with the natural world.</p><p></p><p>

(February 22, 1771		Rome-September 2, 1844			Rome)

	
		also known as Vincenzo Cammuccini

	
was
an Italian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a painter and an art teacher, who is considered one of the most important artists of the early 19th century in Rome. He was trained under the guidance of Domenico Corvi, Pompeo Batoni, and others. Camuccini became a prominent figure in the Roman art scene due to his refined technique and his ability to incorporate Neoclassical elements into his works. His paintings often depict images from history and mythology, and his attention to detail and composition is evident in his works. Some of his famous works include "The Death of Caesar," "The Triumph of Titus and Vespasian," and "The Discovery of the Body of Regulus." Besides his artworks, Camuccini was also known for his activities as the Director of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, where he was responsible for the education of many future painters. He received numerous accolades for his contributions to art and culture, including the prestigious "Order of the Iron Crown" in 1825.</p><p>Camuccini's style was admired by his contemporaries and he became a successful artist in his own right, receiving commissions from prominent figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII. His works were also exhibited in major European cities such as Paris and London. In addition to his career as an artist, Camuccini was also involved in politics, serving as a member of the Roman Republic and later as a senator in the Papal States. He was also a member of the Carbonari, a secret society that advocated for Italian unification. Despite his political activities, Camuccini remained committed to his art, continuing to paint until his death in 1844. Today, his works can be found in major museums and galleries around the world, including the Louvre in Paris and the Vatican Museums in Rome.</p><p>Camuccini's style was heavily influenced by the grandeur and idealism of the neoclassical movement, which he mastered to great effect. He was also known for his prolific output, producing numerous works throughout his career. In addition to history and mythology, Camuccini also painted portraits and religious works, and his style evolved over time to incorporate Romantic elements. Despite his artistic success, Camuccini also faced criticism for his insistence on traditional techniques and subject matter, which some felt hindered the progress of Italian art. Nonetheless, his legacy as one of the most important Italian painters of the 19th century remains secure.</p><p>As the Director of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, Camuccini was instrumental in shaping the next generation of artists. He taught many future painters, including Francesco Podesti, Tommaso Minardi, and Vincenzo Marinelli. He also founded his own art school, which he called the Scuola Libera del Nudo or Free School of the Nude, in which students could study the human figure without censorship. Camuccini was a strong advocate of academic art, which stressed the importance of drawing and classical ideals in painting. His influence can be seen in the work of many of his students, who went on to become successful artists in their own right. </p><p>In addition to his artistic and educational contributions, Camuccini was also a vocal proponent of Italian independence from foreign domination. He was a member of the Carbonari, a secret society that sought to overthrow the ruling powers and establish a unified Italian nation. Camuccini's political activities sometimes put him at odds with the authorities, and he was briefly imprisoned for his involvement in the 1820 revolution in Naples. Nonetheless, he continued to work and paint throughout his life, and his legacy as a painter, educator, and patriot endures to this day.</p><p>Camuccini's personal life was marked by tragedy. He lost his wife and several of his children at a young age, and his only surviving son died in a duel at the age of 22. Despite these hardships, Camuccini remained dedicated to his art and his students, and he continued to work and paint until his death. He was admired by his contemporaries not only for his artistic talents but also for his generosity and kindness. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures in Italian art and culture, a pioneer of the neoclassical and Romantic movements, and a visionary educator who shaped the next generation of artists.</p><p></p><p>
