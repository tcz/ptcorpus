(April 15, 1888		Iquique-September 8, 1922			Selsey)


was
a Chilean
personality.


					</p><p>Arthur Jewell was a Chilean aviator, known for his daring feats in the world of aviation during the early 20th century. He gained recognition for being the first person to fly from England to South America in 1920, making stops in Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Senegal, and Brazil, among other destinations. Jewell was also a skilled mechanic and inventor, who designed and built his own aircraft. He tragically died in a plane crash at the age of 34, while attempting to break the world altitude record. Despite his short career, Jewell's contribution to aviation has been significant, making him an important figure in Chilean history.</p><p>Jewell was born in Iquique, a city in northern Chile, to British parents. He grew up in Chile but later moved to England, where he pursued his passion for aviation. He received his pilot's license in 1912 and worked as a mechanic for various aviation companies before designing and building his own airplane, the Jewell Special.</p><p>Jewell's historic flight from England to South America in 1920 took him 51 days to complete, and he encountered many challenges along the way. He had to fly over the mountains of the Andes to reach his final destination in Santiago, making him the first pilot to do so. His accomplishment made him a hero in South America and garnered him international fame.</p><p>Jewell went on to set several other aviation records, including the world altitude record in 1921, but he tragically lost his life the following year while attempting to break his own record. His legacy in aviation lives on, and he is remembered as a pioneer who paved the way for future pilots and advancements in aircraft technology.</p><p>In addition to his aviation accomplishments, Arthur Jewell was also a skilled musician and played the piano and violin. He often entertained his fellow aviators with his musical talents during long flights. Jewell was also an advocate for aviation safety and dedicated much of his time to improving the safety standards of aircraft. He was one of the founding members of the Royal Aero Club of Chile and was a strong supporter of aviation education programs. Today, he is honored in Chile with a monument and an airport named after him. His contributions to aviation have also been recognized by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in the United States.</p><p></p><p>

(December 18, 1948-September 18, 1983)

	
		also known as Miguel Kast Rist

	
was
a Chilean
economist.


					</p><p>He was born in Santiago, Chile and studied economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile before obtaining a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago. Kast became known for advocating for market-oriented economic reforms in Chile during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in the 1970s and 1980s. </p><p>Kast was a professor of economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chicago, where he worked alongside well-known economists such as Milton Friedman and George Stigler. He was also a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. </p><p>Apart from his academic work, Kast was involved in politics and served as a member of the Economic Advisory Committee for the Pinochet government from 1976 to 1982. He was strongly in favor of privatization and free market reforms, which were implemented under Pinochet's government. </p><p>Tragically, Kast died in a car accident in 1983 at the age of 34. Despite his relatively short career, Kast's work has had a lasting impact on economic policy in Chile and beyond.</p><p>Kast's influence on Chilean economics was significant, and he is widely regarded as one of the architects of the market-oriented economic policies that were implemented in the country following the military coup in 1973. In addition to his work as an academic and advisor to the government, Kast was also a prolific writer and contributed numerous articles to academic journals and newspapers on topics such as inflation, economic growth, and international trade. His most influential book, "The Economic Future of Latin America", co-authored with Arnold Harberger, argued for the benefits of free-market policies in the region. Kast was also a strong proponent of education as a means of promoting economic development and played a key role in the establishment of several centers for economic research in Chile. In recognition of his contributions to economics, the Miguel Kast Prize is awarded annually to the best student in economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.</p><p>Kast was known for his controversial views on economics, which often placed him at odds with the political left in Chile. He argued that market-oriented reforms were necessary to promote economic growth and lift people out of poverty. Kast believed that state intervention in the economy often led to inefficiencies and corruption, and that the private sector was better equipped to provide goods and services at a lower cost. While many of his ideas were controversial, Kast's influence on economic policy in Chile has been widely acknowledged by scholars and policymakers alike. His work on privatization, deregulation, and free trade laid the foundation for Chile's economic success in the following decades, and has inspired similar reforms in other countries throughout the world. Although Kast died at a young age, he left behind a legacy of scholarship and advocacy that continues to inspire economists and policymakers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
