(January 27, 1893		Vienna-December 31, 1944)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>Marcel Tyberg was a composer and pianist, widely regarded as a musical prodigy in his youth. He studied under the guidance of notable composers such as Alexander von Zemlinsky and Arnold Schoenberg, and was heavily influenced by the music of Gustav Mahler. However, his promising career was cut short when he was sent to a Nazi-run internment camp in 1944.</p><p>It wasn't until 2008 that his musical legacy was rediscovered, when a collection of his orchestral music was found in the possession of a family in the United States. Many of his works were performed publicly for the first time in 2011, marking the start of a renewed interest in his music. Today, Marcel Tyberg is recognized as a significant musical figure of the early 20th century, and his music is widely performed and celebrated.</p><p>Despite the little recognition he received in his lifetime, Marcel Tyberg's compositions showcase a unique blend of romanticism and modernism. His music is known for its complexity and grandeur, and has been compared to that of Mahler and Bruckner. After the discovery of his music, scholars and musicians alike have praised his works as a significant contribution to the music world. Tyberg's Symphony No. 2 was premiered by the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra in 2018, bringing his music to an even wider audience. In addition to his compositions, Tyberg was also an accomplished pianist and often performed his own music in private concerts. His tragic story has also brought attention to the struggles faced by many Jewish artists during the Holocaust. Nevertheless, his music continues to inspire listeners and musicians around the world.</p><p>Marcel Tyberg's family was of Jewish heritage but he converted to Catholicism later in life. He worked as an accountant and lived a relatively quiet life, focusing on his music and avoiding attention. Tyberg was also known for his kindness and generosity, often helping fellow internees in the internment camp where he was imprisoned. Despite the hardships he faced, Marcel Tyberg never lost his passion for music and continued to compose until his death. Today, his music is seen as a testament to his enduring spirit and artistic vision.</p><p></p><p>
