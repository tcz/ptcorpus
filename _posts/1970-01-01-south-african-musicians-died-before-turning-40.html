Her activism led her to become a key figure in the Anti-Eviction Campaign and she was a vocal critic of government policies that failed to address the needs of the country's poorest citizens. Grootboom's legacy continues to inspire activists across South Africa who work tirelessly to address the country's social and economic inequalities.</p><p>In addition to her work as an activist, Irene Grootboom was also a devoted mother of six children.

Despite her own difficult circumstances, Grootboom remained committed to fighting for the rights of others and worked tirelessly to raise awareness about issues of poverty and inequality in South Africa. Her tireless efforts earned her numerous accolades, including the prestigious Reebok Human Rights Award in 2002. Although she passed away at a young age, Grootboom's impact on South African society continues to be felt to this day. Her courage, determination, and commitment to social justice have inspired countless individuals to dedicate their lives to the fight for a more equitable and just world.</p><p>Irene Grootboom's legacy continues to inspire not only activists in South Africa but also human rights advocates around the world.

(August 8, 1882		Wellington-August 11, 1915			Gallipoli)


was
a South African
soldier.


					</p><p>Alfred Shout was a highly decorated soldier who fought in both the Second Boer War and World War I. He started his military career as a private in the 3rd New Zealand Contingent during the Second Boer War, where he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his bravery in battle.</p><p>After the war, Shout joined the South African Army and was posted to German South-West Africa (now Namibia) where he served as a scout. He quickly rose through the ranks and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1908. He was later promoted to captain in 1913.</p><p>When World War I broke out, Shout was sent to German East Africa (now Tanzania) where he served under Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck in the East African Campaign. He was later sent to Gallipoli as part of the 2nd South African Infantry Regiment, where he was wounded in action and died from his injuries.</p><p>Despite his short life, Shout was remembered as a brave and dedicated soldier who served his country with distinction. To honor his memory, a mountain in Tanzania was named after him, as well as a street in the town of Malmesbury, South Africa, where he grew up.</p><p>Shout was born in Wellington, South Africa, in 1882, and spent his childhood in Malmesbury. After completing his education, he worked as a clerk before enlisting in the army. He was known for his physical prowess and marksmanship, which made him an ideal candidate for military service.</p><p>During his time in German South-West Africa, Shout gained a reputation as a skilled and daring scout. He was commended for his bravery on several occasions and was ultimately awarded the Military Cross for his actions in the field.</p><p>Shout's service in the East African Campaign was no less impressive. He participated in several major battles and played a vital role in coordinating troops and supplies in the difficult terrain of the African bush. His efforts earned him a promotion to major and the respect of his fellow soldiers.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Shout's life was tragically cut short at the age of 33. His death at Gallipoli was mourned by his comrades, who remembered him as a loyal and courageous leader. Today, his legacy lives on through monuments, streets, and other tributes around the world.</p><p>Shout's bravery and leadership have been the subject of numerous books and articles, and he is still regarded as a hero in South Africa and New Zealand. In addition to the honors he received during his lifetime, Shout was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for bravery in the British and Commonwealth armed forces.</p><p>Shout's Victoria Cross citation reads:</p><p>"For most conspicuous bravery at Lone Pine trenches, in the Gallipoli Peninsula, on the 9th August, 1915. Captain Shout, seeing that the Australians had been driven back to their original trench except for a small portion of the trench to the south-east, and that a strong Turkish force, with bombers, was pressing them hard and enfiladed them from the southward, realized that unless something was done and done at once the Australians would be driven off the plateau, and the position rendered entirely untenable. He accordingly collected a small party of men and led them with the greatest determination against the Turks. There were in the trench at the time only Captain Shout and Lieutenant H. C. Bolden and about six or eight men. The enemy bombing was incessant, but Captain Shout led his party along the trench against the bomb-throwers, and himself bombed and bayonetted the enemy till he cleared them out, and finally succeeded in consolidating the position.</p><p>Captain Shout showed conspicuous bravery and great ability, and saved a very dangerous situation."</p><p>This citation highlights the incredible courage and audacity of Captain Alfred Shout, who risked his life to save his fellow soldiers and ensure the success of his mission. He remains an inspiration to soldiers and civilians alike, a testament to the bravery and selflessness of those who serve their country.</p><p>Alfred Shout's heroism was recognized not just through military honors, but also through literary works. He was mentioned in the book "The Big Game of Africa" by Percy Fitzpatrick, the author of "Jock of the Bushveld". Fitzpatrick called Shout "one of the most exceptional men it has been my good fortune to meet, while the Victoria Cross he won later fully justified my estimate of his character." In addition, Shout was also featured in a poem by Sir Henry Newbolt called "The Vigil", which honors the bravery of soldiers who lost their lives in the World War I. Alfred Shout's legacy continues to inspire present-day soldiers to uphold and emulate his selflessness and dedication to serving their country.</p><p></p><p>

						</p><p>Rick Turner was known for his activism against apartheid in South Africa. He was a lecturer at the University of Natal (now the University of KwaZulu-Natal) where he encouraged students to question authority and engage in social activism. He played a key role in the formation of the University's Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) and was one of the founding members of the Durban branch of the South African Students' Organisation (SASO). </p><p>Turner's activism led to his assassination in 1978, when he was killed by a group of right-wing extremists. His death sparked widespread outrage and protests, and he was hailed as a martyr for the anti-apartheid movement. In his honor, the Rick Turner Scholarship was established to support students who promote social justice and equality. </p><p>Aside from his political activism, Turner was also an accomplished philosopher, with a particular interest in the works of French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. His ideas on social change and the role of intellectuals in society continue to inspire activists and scholars around the world.</p><p>Turner was also a prolific author, with several notable publications to his name. His works include "The Eye of the Needle: Towards Participatory Democracy in South Africa" and "Africa and the World: The Crisis of Conscience". He was a gifted public speaker and his lectures on a range of topics, from philosophy to politics, were highly regarded. Turner was an advocate for nonviolent protest and believed in the power of grassroots activism. His legacy continues to inspire social justice movements around the world, and his commitment to radical change and the fight against oppression serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for equality and justice.</p><p>Turner's commitment to justice and activism began at a young age. He was born into a family of liberal academics and grew up in Cape Town. His father was a professor of physics at the University of Cape Town, and his mother was a linguist. Turner became involved in anti-apartheid activism while studying at the University of Cape Town, where he was involved with the National Union of South African Students.</p><p>After completing his undergraduate degree, Turner moved to France to pursue a PhD in philosophy at the Sorbonne. While in Europe, he became increasingly disillusioned with the Western philosophical tradition and turned his attention to decolonial and Marxist thought. He returned to South Africa in the early 1970s, joining the University of Natal's Philosophy Department in 1972.</p><p>Turner quickly became a prominent figure at the University, and his lectures on Sartre and Marxist philosophy attracted a large following. He used his position to encourage students to question authority and challenge the status quo, both in higher education and in society at large. He played a key role in the formation of the BCM, which aimed to promote black consciousness and challenge the apartheid government.</p><p>Turner's activism led to threats and harassment from right-wing groups, including the security forces. He was placed under surveillance and was the target of an assassination attempt in 1976. Despite this, he continued to speak out against the apartheid government and to advocate for social justice.</p><p>In January 1978, Turner was assassinated outside his home in Durban by a right-wing extremist group. He was just 34 years old. His death sparked widespread protests and calls for justice, and he was posthumously awarded the Order of Luthuli by the South African government in 2016.</p><p>Turner's life and work continue to inspire activists and scholars around the world. His commitment to social justice and nonviolent protest, as well as his insights into the role of intellectuals in society, remain hugely influential. The Rick Turner Scholarship, which supports students who promote social justice and equality, serves as a lasting tribute to his legacy.</p><p>In addition to his involvement in anti-apartheid activism, Rick Turner was also passionate about ecology and environmentalism. He was known for advocating for sustainable development and exploring alternative ways of living. Turner believed that issues of social justice and environmentalism were interconnected and that true liberation could not be achieved without addressing both. He was also an advocate for animal rights and was actively involved in campaigns to protect endangered species. Turner's wide-ranging interests and his commitment to social and environmental justice made him a truly unique and visionary thinker.</p><p></p><p>
