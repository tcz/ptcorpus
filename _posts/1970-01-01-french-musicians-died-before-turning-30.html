was
a French
lawyer.


					</p><p>Barbaroux was a significant figure of the French Revolution and was part of the Girondist faction. He was known for his eloquence as a speaker and his passion for justice, which led him to become a vocal opponent of the radical Jacobin Club during the Reign of Terror.</p><p>Barbaroux played a key role in organizing the insurrection of June 1792 that led to the downfall of King Louis XVI. He also helped to frame the constitution of 1793 that abolished the monarchy and established the French Republic.</p><p>However, Barbaroux became increasingly disillusioned with the excesses of the Revolution and the tactics of the Jacobins. He was eventually arrested and imprisoned, along with many other Girondists, and was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal.</p><p>On the day of his execution, Barbaroux reportedly walked calmly to the guillotine, dressed in his lawyer's robes, and called out "Vive la république!" right before his execution. His death was seen as a symbol of the excesses and brutality of the Reign of Terror, and he has since become a symbol of the struggle for democracy and justice in France.</p><p>Barbaroux was born to a family of wealthy merchants in Marseille and was educated in law. He began his career as a lawyer in Marseille and quickly rose to prominence due to his legal acumen and dedication to justice. He became involved in politics during the early days of the Revolution and aligned himself with the Girondist faction, which advocated for a republic based on democracy and constitutional government.</p><p>During his time as a member of the National Convention, Barbaroux worked closely with fellow Girondist leaders such as Jacques-Pierre Brissot and Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud to promote their democratic and constitutional ideas. He became a vocal opponent of the radical Jacobin Club and its leaders, including Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton, who he saw as a threat to the principles of the Revolution.</p><p>Barbaroux's involvement in the insurrection of June 1792, which marked a turning point in the Revolution and led to the downfall of the monarchy, cemented his reputation as a revolutionary leader. He played a key role in drafting the new constitution of 1793, which established the First French Republic and abolished the monarchy.</p><p>However, tensions between the Girondists and the more radical factions of the Revolution began to escalate, and Barbaroux found himself increasingly marginalized and persecuted. He was eventually arrested and charged with treason, and his name was added to the infamous "list of proscribed persons" issued by the Committee of Public Safety. </p><p>Despite his impending execution, Barbaroux remained committed to the principles of the Revolution and refused to renounce his beliefs. He maintained his composure even on the day of his execution, and his courage in the face of his sentence has become legendary. Today, Barbaroux is remembered as a hero of the Revolution and a symbol of the struggle for justice and democracy in France.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by guillotine.

During the French Revolution, he became actively involved in politics and was elected to the National Convention in 1792. As a member of the Convention, he supported the execution of King Louis XVI and was a key player in the downfall of Maximilien Robespierre. </p><p>However, Goujon's political career was cut short when he was arrested by the Jacobin government in 1794. He spent several months in prison before being released in January 1795. Shortly after his release, he tragically committed suicide by drowning himself in the Seine River. The reasons for his suicide remain unknown, although it is believed that he may have been struggling with mental illness or the trauma of his imprisonment. Despite his short life, Goujon is remembered as an important figure in the French Revolution and a passionate defender of radical democracy.</p><p>Goujon was married twice during his lifetime. His first wife, Marie Anne Josèphe Lhuillier, whom he married in 1787, died in 1792, leaving behind two children. He remarried in 1793 to Alexandrine Filleul, who was the widow of a guillotined deputy. Goujon was also known for his passion for literature and the arts, and he frequently attended the salons of prominent figures in Parisian society. He was particularly interested in the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and was an avid collector of his works. After his death, Goujon's political writings and speeches were published in a collection entitled "Œuvres de Goujon" and were much celebrated in radical circles. His legacy continues to be debated and discussed by historians and political scholars to this day.</p><p></p><p>
