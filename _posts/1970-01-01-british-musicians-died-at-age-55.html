(November 11, 1904		Chennai-May 8, 1960			Princeton)


was
a British
mathematician.


					</p><p>Whitehead made significant contributions to topology, homotopy theory, algebraic topology, and differential geometry. His work on the Whitehead manifold and the Poincaré conjecture gained him widespread recognition in the mathematical community. Along with his brother, mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, J. H. C. Whitehead was also active in the religious and philosophical fields. He served as a professor at various institutions, including the University of Oxford, where he helped establish the Oxford University Computing Laboratory. Despite his untimely death at the age of 55, Whitehead's impact on mathematics and computer science has endured and he is still considered one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century.</p><p>In addition to his work in mathematics and computer science, J. H. C. Whitehead was a devoted family man. He was married to Esther Whitehead, an accomplished mathematician in her own right, and the couple had three children together. Whitehead was also known for his love of music and art, and he often attended concerts and visited museums in his free time. His legacy lives on through the many mathematicians and computer scientists who have been inspired by his work, and his contributions to these fields continue to shape our understanding of the universe.</p><p>Whitehead was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received his Bachelor of Arts in 1926 and his PhD in 1930. He then worked at Princeton University from 1937 to 1960, where he served as the founding director of the Institute for Advanced Study. During World War II, Whitehead worked at the British Admiralty, where he developed new techniques for codebreaking. He was also involved in planning the Allied invasion of Europe.</p><p>Whitehead was a prolific author, publishing more than 100 papers during his career. His book "Elements of Homotopy Theory" is considered a classic in the field. Whitehead was known for his clear and concise writing style, and his ability to explain complex mathematical concepts in a way that was accessible to non-experts.</p><p>Whitehead's contributions to mathematics and computer science have been recognized with many prestigious awards and honors. In 1953 he was awarded the Adams Prize, and in 1958 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was also a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p><p>Today, Whitehead's work continues to have applications in fields ranging from physics to computer science. His contributions to topology and algebraic topology have had a profound influence on the development of these fields, and his work on the Poincaré conjecture laid the groundwork for the eventual proof by Grigori Perelman in 2002. Whitehead's legacy as one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century remains secure.</p><p></p><p>

		are
		called
		Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig, Lord Alfred Douglas and Percy Douglas, 10th Marquess of Queensberry.

						</p><p>John Douglas was best known for his rules governing boxing, which came to be known as the Queensberry Rules. He was also notorious for his feud with Oscar Wilde, whom he accused of homosexuality. Douglas was eventually tried for criminal libel and found guilty. This led to his social and financial ruin, and he died a few years later in poverty. However, his legacy in the world of boxing continues to this day, and his rules are still widely used in the sport.</p><p>In addition to being a politician and his contribution to boxing, John Douglas, the 9th Marquess of Queensberry, was also an avid athlete himself. He was a skilled cricket player and even competed in the first-ever cricket match held at Lords Cricket Ground in London in 1877. </p><p>Douglas also had a keen interest in the arts, particularly sculpture. He contributed to the promotion of avant-garde artists like Aubrey Beardsley and Charles Ricketts. He also commissioned several sculptures, including one of his son Viscount Drumlanrig, which currently stands in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. </p><p>Despite his tumultuous personal life and legal troubles, John Douglas was highly regarded by his contemporaries as a man of great wit and intelligence. He was known for his engaging conversation and larger-than-life personality, which made him a popular figure in social circles of the era.</p><p>In addition to his accomplishments in sports and the arts, John Douglas was also a member of the House of Lords, serving as a Scottish representative from 1880 until his death. He was outspoken in his political views, advocating for causes such as Scottish home rule and prison reform. Douglas was also a supporter of women's suffrage and helped to fund the campaign for women's right to vote. Despite his progressive political beliefs, Douglas was also known for his conservative social views and adherence to traditional values. He vehemently opposed what he saw as the decadence and moral decay of the fin de siècle era, particularly in the realm of homosexuality, which he believed to be a sin and a threat to society. Douglas was a complicated and controversial figure, but his contributions to sports, art, and politics continue to shape the world today.</p><p></p><p>

He was also an avid amateur naturalist and often incorporated his observations of nature into his writing.</p><p>Kingsley was known for his muscular Christianity philosophy, which emphasized the importance of physical fitness and manliness in Christian living. He particularly admired the muscular Christianity example set by Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby School, where Kingsley had once been a student. His advocacy for physical fitness extended beyond his philosophy to his personal life - he enjoyed swimming, walking, and boating throughout his life. </p><p>In 1860, Kingsley was involved in a famous debate with biologist Thomas Huxley over evolution. Kingsley was a proponent of the idea of God's role in evolution, while Huxley was a supporter of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Despite their differences, they remained friends throughout their lives. </p><p>Kingsley's legacy is still felt today, particularly in the literary world. His works have been adapted for film, television, and beyond, and he is remembered as an important figure in Victorian literature.</p><p>Kingsley was born in Holne, Devon, England, to a family of clergymen. He was educated at King's College London and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he earned a degree in theology. After Cambridge, he worked briefly as a curate in Hampshire, where he gained a reputation for his progressive views on education and social issues.</p><p>In 1844, Kingsley married Frances Eliza Grenfell, with whom he had two children. Frances, who shared her husband's interest in social reform, was a founding member of the YWCA and campaigned for women's suffrage.</p><p>Kingsley's interest in social reform was reflected in his writing, particularly in works such as "Alton Locke" and "Yeast," which addressed issues such as poverty, class inequality, and sanitation. His involvement in social causes extended beyond his writing, and he was a member of several organizations, including the Christian Socialists and the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science.</p><p>Kingsley's advocacy for physical fitness and manliness was also reflected in his involvement in the early Boy Scout movement. He was a friend and mentor to the movement's founder, Robert Baden-Powell, and was influential in shaping the organization's philosophy.</p><p>Throughout his life, Kingsley struggled with depression and anxiety, and his personal life was marked by tragedy. His daughter Mary died in infancy, and his son Maurice died of typhoid fever at age four. Kingsley himself died at age 55, after suffering a heart attack while bathing in the sea near his home.</p><p></p><p>

Adams became an adviser to the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu and played a significant role in the establishment of trade relations between England and Japan. He was granted the title of samurai and given a stipend by the shogun, allowing him to live comfortably in Japan until his death in 1620. Today, he is considered a key figure in the history of Japan-England relations and his life has been the subject of multiple books, plays, and films.</p><p>Adams was born in Gillingham, Kent, England and worked as a master mariner for the British Royal Navy in the early 17th century. He was hired by the British East India Company for a voyage to the Far East, but his ship, the "Lion", was separated from the fleet during a storm and he found himself stranded in Japan in 1600. He was initially treated as a prisoner of war but later gained the trust of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who recognized his maritime expertise.</p><p>Adams assisted the shogunate in establishing shipyards and developing the necessary maritime technology to compete with other European powers. He was instrumental in designing and building Japan's first Western-style sailing ship, known as the San Juan Bautista, which was the first Japanese ship to sail to the Americas. His experience and knowledge of foreign trade helped to open up Japan's economy to the outside world.</p><p>Adams was married to a Japanese woman, Oyuki, and had several children. He left behind a legacy in Japan that remains to this day, with a Memorial Museum in his honor located in Hirado. His story has inspired numerous adaptations, including James Clavell's novel "Shogun", which was later turned into a popular TV miniseries.</p><p>Aside from his accomplishments in Japan, William Adams also made significant contributions to the development of global trade. Adams was a strong advocate for free trade and opposed the policies of the Dutch East India Company that monopolized trade in the Far East. Adams believed that a balance of power and fair competition would contribute to the growth of global trade. His views were influential in the formation of the English East India Company, which later became one of the most powerful trading companies in the world.</p><p>Despite his success in Japan, Adams faced several challenges during his time there. He had to adapt to Japanese culture and customs, which included learning the language and adopting Japanese dress. He also faced discrimination as a foreigner and had to navigate complex political relationships in order to maintain his position.
