						Jonathan Larson was best known for his creation of the rock musical Rent, which won a Pulitzer Prize for Drama and multiple Tony Awards. It was also adapted into a feature film. Before Rent, he wrote and composed many other musicals, but none of them were as well-received as Rent. Tragically, Larson died unexpectedly of an aortic dissection the night before the first preview performance of Rent's off-Broadway debut, never seeing the massive success the show would become. However, his impact on musical theater is still felt to this day, with many considering him to be one of the most influential forces in musical theater of the 20th century.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=296337" title="Wikipedia article about Jonathan Larson">Jonathan Larson on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/japanese-actresses-died-in-2012.html' title='Japanese actresses died in 2012'><strong>Japanese actresses died in 2012</strong> List of the top 5 Japanese actresses who died in 2012</a></li><li><a href='/american-actors-born-in-1952.html' title='American actors born in 1952'><strong>American actors born in 1952</strong> List of the top 50 American actors who were born in 1952</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actors-died-in-1968.html' title='Indian actors died in 1968'><strong>Indian actors died in 1968</strong> List of the top 3 Indian actors who died in 1968</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/malaysian-actresses-died-in-stroke.html' title='Malaysian actresses died in Stroke'><strong>Malaysian actresses died in Stroke</strong> List of the top 1 Malaysian actresses who died in Stroke</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-born-in-1964.html' title='Famous musicians born in 1964'><strong>Famous musicians born in 1964</strong> List of the top 50 Famous  music stars who died in who were born in 1964</a></li><li><a href='/swiss-actresses-died-in-1985.html' title='Swiss actresses died in 1985'><strong>Swiss actresses died in 1985</strong> List of the top 1 Swiss actresses who died in 1985</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
