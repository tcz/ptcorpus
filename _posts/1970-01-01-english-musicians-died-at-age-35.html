Joan was initially supportive of her brother's reign, but she became disillusioned with him due to his neglect of her nephew, Edward III. She joined forces with her cousin, Thomas of Lancaster, and other discontented nobles to try to force Edward II to abdicate. The plot ultimately failed, and Joan was imprisoned for several months before being released.</p><p>Despite the challenges she faced in her life, Joan of Acre was widely respected and admired both during her lifetime and afterwards.
