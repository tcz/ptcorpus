(October 7, 1879		Gävle-November 19, 1915			Utah)


was
an American
songwriter.


					</p><p>He was born in Sweden as Joel Emmanuel Hägglund and immigrated to the United States in 1902. Hill was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, also known as the "Wobblies," and used his music to spread socialist and labor union messages. He is best known for songs like "The Preacher and the Slave" and "There is Power in a Union." Hill was also an active organizer and participated in strikes, which led to his arrest and eventual execution by firing squad for a murder he may not have committed. Hill continues to be a symbol of labor activism and protest in American history.</p><p>Before becoming a labor activist, Joe Hill worked at a variety of jobs including as a miner, dockworker, and lumberjack. His experiences in these jobs helped shape his views on the importance of worker solidarity and rights. He often traveled the country, using his music to support striking workers and raise awareness about labor issues. </p><p>Hill's trial and execution are still controversial today, and many believe he was wrongfully convicted due to his labor activism and socialist beliefs. His famous quote, "Don't mourn, organize!" has become a rallying cry for labor movements and political activists worldwide. His songs continue to inspire musicians and activists to this day, and his legacy has been celebrated in films, books, and plays. Hill's life and legacy are a testament to the power of music as a tool for social change.</p><p></p><p>
