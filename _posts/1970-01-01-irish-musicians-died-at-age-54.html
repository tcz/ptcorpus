Getty III gained notoriety in 1973 when he was kidnapped in Rome at the age of 16 by a group of criminals who demanded a ransom of $17 million ($100 million today) from his grandfather. Despite the elder Getty's immense wealth, he initially refused to pay the ransom, which resulted in Getty III being held captive for several months during which his captors mutilated him. Eventually, Getty III was released after his grandfather paid a reduced ransom of $2.2 million. The incident inspired the 2017 film "All the Money in the World". Getty III struggled with drug addiction and health issues for much of his life and was left partially paralyzed and blind after a stroke in the 1980s. He lived the remainder of his life in seclusion and died in 2011 at the age of 54.</p><p></p><p>
