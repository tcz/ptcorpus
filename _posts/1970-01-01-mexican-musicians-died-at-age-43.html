(November 12, 1651		Tepetlixpa-April 17, 1695			Mexico City)

	
		also known as Juana Inés de la Cruz, Juana Inés de Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana, Juana Inés de la Cruz Sister or Sor Juana

	
was
a Mexican
writer, mathematician, poet and nun.


					</p><p>Born in Mexico, Juana Inés de la Cruz was a gifted child who learned to read and write at a young age. She was especially interested in literature and began writing poetry at the age of eight. At the age of 16, she was sent to live in the court of the viceroy in Mexico City, where she became known for her intelligence and wit. </p><p>Despite societal expectations for women at the time, Juana Inés de la Cruz was determined to pursue her education. She read widely and became proficient in several languages, including Latin and Nahuatl, the language spoken by the Aztecs. She also became known for her mathematical and scientific abilities.</p><p>However, in 1667, Juana Inés de la Cruz entered a convent, where she became a nun. Despite this, she continued to write, producing works on a variety of subjects, including religion, philosophy, and the role of women in society. She also wrote poetry and plays, many of which were performed in the court of the viceroy.</p><p>Throughout her life, Juana Inés de la Cruz struggled to reconcile her intellectual pursuits with her religious calling. She faced criticism from the Church for her writings and her refusal to conform to traditional gender roles. However, she remained committed to her beliefs and her love of learning until her death in 1695. Today, she is remembered as one of the most important writers and intellectuals in Mexican history.</p><p>In addition to her prolific writing career, Juana Inés de la Cruz was also known for her progressive beliefs, particularly when it came to gender roles and women's education. She believed that women should have access to the same educational opportunities as men and argued that women's intellectual abilities were on par with those of men. She also criticized the patriarchal society of her time, which discriminated against women and relegated them to subservient roles.</p><p>Her writings often examined these themes, and she became known as an advocate for women's rights and empowerment. In her most famous work, "Respuesta a Sor Filotea" (Reply to Sister Philotea), she defended her right to pursue her intellectual passions and her decision to join the convent, despite criticisms from the Church.</p><p>Juana Inés de la Cruz's legacy continues to inspire generations of women and intellectuals in Mexico and around the world. She has been recognized as a national icon in Mexico and her face is featured on the country's 200-peso bill. In 2018, she was even honored with a Google Doodle on what would have been her 366th birthday.</p><p>Despite her many accomplishments, Juana Inés de la Cruz faced numerous challenges throughout her life. She struggled with depression and anxiety, likely due in part to the pressures placed on her as a woman in a patriarchal society. She also faced criticism from some members of the Church, who believed that her writings were too secular and that she should focus solely on her religious duties as a nun.</p><p>In 1693, after a controversy involving her writings, Juana Inés de la Cruz was forced to give up her books and instruments and to cease writing. She died just two years later, possibly as a result of an illness made worse by her despair over being unable to pursue her intellectual pursuits.</p><p>Despite the obstacles she faced, Juana Inés de la Cruz remained committed to her beliefs and her love of learning throughout her life. Her many writings, which include both poetry and prose, continue to be studied and admired today for their intelligence, wit, and insight into the society in which she lived. In addition to her status as a literary and intellectual icon, she is also widely considered to be one of Mexico's most important cultural and historical figures.</p><p></p><p>

was
a Mexican
personality.


					</p><p>He was a soldier and politician who is best known for his role in the Mexican War of Independence and his efforts to modernize and reform the Mexican government in the early 19th century. Mier y Terán rose to prominence as a young officer in the Spanish colonial army and fought in some of the key battles of the war. After Mexico gained independence, he became a leading figure in the new government and played a key role in drafting Mexico's first written constitution. He also advocated for greater education and industrialization in Mexico and was one of the first Mexicans to recognize the potential of the country's vast oil reserves. Despite his many accomplishments, Mier y Terán's career was cut short when he was assassinated in 1832 while leading an expedition to put down a rebellion in the state of Tamaulipas. Nonetheless, his legacy lives on and he is widely regarded as one of Mexico's most important early statesmen.</p><p>Mier y Terán was also a prolific writer, leaving behind a collection of letters, diaries, and essays that provide valuable insights into the political, social, and economic conditions of early 19th-century Mexico. In his writings, he expressed his deep commitment to democracy, liberalism, and social justice, and his belief in the need to harness Mexico's vast resources to build a modern, prosperous, and equitable society. He also wrote extensively about his military campaigns, providing vivid descriptions of the battles he fought and the challenges he faced as a soldier and commander.</p><p>Mier y Terán was a controversial figure in his own time, drawing criticism from both conservatives and radicals for his advocacy of reform and his willingness to work with foreign investors and governments. Some saw him as a visionary leader who could help transform Mexico into a great nation, while others viewed him as a traitor who was selling out his country to foreign interests. Nonetheless, his contributions to Mexico's early history are widely recognized today, and he is remembered as a patriot, a statesman, and a visionary who helped lay the foundations for modern Mexico.</p><p>In addition to his political and military achievements, Mier y Terán was also a scholar and intellectual. He was particularly interested in the natural sciences, and was instrumental in establishing the first scientific society in Mexico, the Royal Mexican Botanical Garden. He also wrote extensively on subjects ranging from botany and geology to politics and economics, and his publications were widely read and respected throughout Mexico and beyond.</p><p>Mier y Terán's commitment to education and scientific discovery reflected his broader vision for Mexico's future. He believed that by investing in education and industrialization, Mexico could build a strong and prosperous society that would be able to compete on the world stage. He also recognized the importance of international trade and investment, and was a strong advocate for opening up Mexico's economy to foreign capital and expertise.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Mier y Terán's ideas and values continued to influence Mexican politics and society for many years to come. His legacy can be seen in Mexico's ongoing efforts to modernize and reform its government, economy, and society, as well as in its continued emphasis on education, science, and innovation as key drivers of national development.</p><p></p><p>

(August 14, 1770		Mexico City-February 3, 1814)


was
a Mexican
personality.


					</p><p>He is best known for his contribution to the Mexican War of Independence. Mariano Matamoros was a Catholic priest who played a major role in the struggle for Mexican independence from Spain. He was a member of the insurgent army and was known for his bravery and leadership in battles. Matamoros was especially influential in the region of Morelos, where he mobilized support for the cause of independence. He also served as a spokesman for the rebel forces, advocating for their rights and demands. In 1814, he was captured by Spanish forces and executed for his role in the revolution. Despite his untimely death, Mariano Matamoros is remembered as a hero of Mexican independence and a symbol of the country's struggle for freedom.</p><p>Mariano Matamoros was born to a humble family in Mexico City and received his education in a seminary. He joined the army at a young age, but after being injured in battle, he decided to become a priest. While serving as a priest, he became increasingly involved in the fight for independence and joined the rebel forces in 1810. His charisma and leadership skills quickly earned him a prominent role in the movement. </p><p>Matamoros was known for his passionate speeches that inspired the people of Mexico to rise up against their Spanish oppressors. He led several successful battles against Spanish armies, including the battle of Izúcar, where he defeated a much larger and better-equipped army. His victories earned him the nickname "the father of the Morelos Army." </p><p>In addition to his military leadership, Matamoros was instrumental in the development of a plan for Mexican independence, known as the Sentiments of the Nation, which called for a democratic government and the abolition of slavery. </p><p>Unfortunately, Matamoros' success was short-lived. In 1814, he was betrayed by a fellow rebel and captured by Spanish authorities. He was executed by firing squad in the city of Valladolid, now known as Morelia. Despite his tragic end, his memory lived on as a symbol of Mexican patriotism and resistance to foreign domination. In 1843, his remains were moved to the Independence Column in Mexico City, where he is honored as a national hero.</p><p>Matamoros' legacy continues to inspire Mexicans to this day. His name is frequently invoked by Mexican politicians, writers, and academics as a symbol of national pride and the struggle for democracy. His life and achievements have been celebrated in countless books, films, and songs, and his image appears on many Mexican coins and banknotes. Matamoros' contribution to Mexican independence is recognized not only within his own country but also by the international community. In 1974, the government of Mexico awarded him the Order of the Aztec Eagle, the country's highest honor for foreigners, in recognition of his role in shaping Mexican history. Today, Mariano Matamoros is remembered not only as a military leader but also as a visionary thinker and a champion of social justice. His name has become synonymous with the fight for a better, more equitable Mexico.</p><p></p><p>
