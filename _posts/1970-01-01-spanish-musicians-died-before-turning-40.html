(May 23, 1905-October 29, 1936)


was
a Spanish
politician, novelist and journalist.


					</p><p>He was a pioneer of Spanish fascism and founded the political party Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (JONS) alongside other intellectuals in 1931. Ledesma Ramos was a leading figure in the far-right movement in Spain in the 1930s, and his writings influenced the ideology of the Falange, the Spanish fascist party that emerged during the Spanish Civil War. In addition to his political activities, Ledesma Ramos was also a prolific writer, publishing several novels and essays, including "Towards a New State" and "The War of the Intellectuals." He was assassinated in 1936 by Republican forces during the early days of the Spanish Civil War. Despite his controversial political views, Ledesma Ramos is still remembered for his contributions to Spanish literature and his role as a major figure in the country's history.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos was born in Alfaraz de Sayago, a municipality in the province of Zamora, Spain. He studied law at the University of Madrid but dropped out before graduating to pursue a career as a journalist. In the early 1920s, he became involved in far-right politics and joined the Spanish Patriotic Union, a nationalist organization. He later became disillusioned with the Union's lack of action and founded the JONS as a more radical alternative.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos, a charismatic speaker, quickly rose to prominence in the JONS and became the editor of the party's newspaper, La Conquista del Estado (The Conquest of the State). He advocated for a totalitarian state modeled after the fascist regimes in Italy and Germany and rejected both liberalism and communism.</p><p>During the 1930s, Ledesma Ramos's ideas gained a following among Spanish intellectuals and artists, including the renowned poet Federico Garcia Lorca. However, his extremist views and his party's violent tactics also made him a target of socialist and anarchist groups, who saw him as a threat to Spain's democracy.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos's assassination in 1936 marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, which would last for three years and result in the victory of General Francisco Franco's Nationalists. Despite the controversy surrounding his political legacy, Ledesma Ramos is still acknowledged as an important figure in Spanish history and his ideas continue to influence far-right movements in Spain and beyond.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos was also a member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Jurisprudence and Legislation and worked as a lawyer for several years before fully dedicating himself to his political and literary pursuits. He was known for his passionate speeches and his unwavering commitment to his political beliefs, which he saw as a necessary response to what he perceived as the failures of liberal democracy and socialism in Spain.</p><p>In addition to his work with the JONS, Ledesma Ramos was involved with several other far-right organizations, including the Spanish Falange and the National Syndicalist Institute. He also wrote for several right-wing newspapers and magazines, including the influential publication Accion Espanola, which espoused a nationalist and traditionalist vision of Spain.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos's writings were marked by their polemical tone and their rejection of liberal democracy, Marxism, and other left-wing ideologies. He argued that only a strong, centralized state, guided by visionary leaders, could save Spain from its perceived decline and create a new era of prosperity and greatness.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Ledesma Ramos continues to be studied and debated by scholars of Spanish history and politics. His ideas and writings remain influential in far-right circles in Spain and elsewhere, and his vision of a strong, authoritarian state continues to resonate with those who seek to challenge the status quo.</p><p></p><p>

was
a Spanish
politician.


					</p><p>However, he is mainly remembered as a key figure in the Mexican Revolution. Along with his brother Francisco I. Madero, Gustavo led the revolution against the dictatorship of President Porfirio Díaz. Gustavo played a crucial role in organizing and financing the revolution through his extensive network of contacts in the United States. After Díaz was ousted, Gustavo continued to be involved in Mexican politics and was elected Senator in 1912. Sadly, Gustavo A. Madero was assassinated only a year later by Victoriano Huerta, who seized power and ultimately plunged the country into a new phase of violence and turmoil. Despite his untimely death, Gustavo A. Madero remains an important historical figure in Mexico's fight for democracy and social justice.</p><p>Gustavo A. Madero was born in Parras de la Fuente, Coahuila, Mexico. He came from a wealthy family in the northern state of Chihuahua, where he received his education. Gustavo was a successful businessman before entering politics, working in the mining and agricultural industries. He was also involved in journalism, writing articles for local newspapers that criticized the Díaz regime. </p><p>Gustavo and his brother Francisco first became involved in politics in 1909, with the publication of Francisco's book "The Presidential Succession of 1910." The book called for free and fair elections in Mexico and criticized Díaz for his long tenure as president. This marked the beginning of the revolution, which aimed to overthrow the dictator and bring about democratic reforms in Mexico. </p><p>Gustavo played a pivotal role in the revolution, using his connections in the U.S. to secure financing and weapons for the rebels. He also helped recruit troops and coordinated logistics for rebel forces. Gustavo was present at the Battle of Ciudad Juárez in 1911, which saw the rebel army under Francisco's leadership defeat Díaz's forces and force him to resign.</p><p>After Díaz's ouster, Gustavo continued to work towards democratic reforms in Mexico. He was elected as a senator in 1912 and pushed for social and economic reforms, including land reform and workers' rights. However, his efforts were cut short when he was assassinated alongside his brother by generals opposed to their reformist agenda. </p><p>Today, Gustavo A. Madero is remembered as a hero of the Mexican Revolution and a symbol of the fight for democracy and social justice in Mexico. His legacy is commemorated in various ways, including through a municipality named after him in Chihuahua and a statue of him and his brother in Mexico City.</p><p>Gustavo A. Madero's assassination had far-reaching consequences for Mexico. His death paved the way for the rise of Victoriano Huerta, a general who took power through violent means and ruled the country with an iron fist. Huerta's regime was marked by widespread human rights abuses and political repression, which fueled further unrest and violence in the country. Gustavo's assassination also had personal implications for his family. His brother Francisco, who had been elected president after the revolution, was deposed and forced into exile by Huerta. Francisco would later be assassinated in 1917, further cementing the tragic fate of the Madero brothers. Despite these setbacks, the ideals and vision that Gustavo and Francisco A. Madero fought for live on in Mexico today, represented by a thriving civil society and a commitment to democracy and the rule of law.</p><p></p><p>
