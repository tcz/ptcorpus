		also known as Dr. Jan Karel van den Broek

	
was
a Dutch
physician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his groundbreaking research in the field of psychology, particularly his work on hypnosis and suggestion. Van den Broek was one of the pioneers of the use of hypnosis as a therapeutic tool, and he conducted early experiments on the effects of suggestion on the human mind.</p><p>Van den Broek was born in the Netherlands, where he received his medical training. After completing his studies, he worked as a physician in various hospitals in the Netherlands, and later in Belgium and Germany. Throughout his career, he maintained a strong interest in psychology and the workings of the human mind.</p><p>Van den Broek's research on hypnosis and suggestion was groundbreaking, and it opened up a new avenue of inquiry in psychology. His experiments showed that hypnosis could be used to induce states of consciousness that were distinct from normal waking states, and that suggestions made during these states could have a powerful effect on a person's thoughts, feelings, and behavior.</p><p>Van den Broek was also an accomplished writer and educator. He wrote numerous articles and books on psychology and hypnosis, and he was a popular lecturer and teacher. His work helped to establish hypnosis as a legitimate field of study and practice, and it paved the way for further research and experimentation in the field of psychology.</p><p>Van den Broek's research had a significant impact on the field of psychology, and his ideas and theories continue to influence modern-day psychologists, particularly those working in the field of hypnosis and psychotherapy.

He was one of the first physicians to describe the symptoms and treatment of epilepsy, and his work helped to improve the lives of people with this condition.</p><p>Despite his numerous contributions to the field of psychology, Van den Broek's work was not without controversy. Some of his contemporaries criticized his methods and theories, and he was accused of using hypnosis to manipulate his patients. However, his legacy as a pioneering psychologist and advocate for the use of hypnosis in psychotherapy remains a significant part of the history of psychology.</p><p>Van den Broek's research on hypnosis and suggestion led him to question the traditional approaches to medicine and psychology in his time. He believed in the power of the mind to heal the body, and he saw hypnosis as a way to tap into this power. He also recognized the importance of the therapeutic relationship between the patient and the therapist, and he emphasized the need for a compassionate and supportive environment for healing to occur.</p><p>Despite his success and recognition in his field, Van den Broek's personal life was marked by tragedy. He suffered the loss of several family members, including his wife and children, and he struggled with his own health issues. He died at the age of 51, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and advocacy for the use of hypnosis in psychotherapy.</p><p>Today, Van den Broek is remembered as a pioneer in the field of psychology, and his work continues to inspire researchers and practitioners in the field. His legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of questioning traditional approaches and exploring new avenues of inquiry in the pursuit of better mental health and well-being.</p><p></p><p>

(May 11, 1894		Werkendam-May 7, 1946			The Hague)


was
a Dutch
engineer, politician and civil engineer.


					</p><p>Mussert was the founder and leader of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), a political party in the Netherlands which collaborated with the Nazi regime during World War II. He became increasingly vocal against the Dutch government and Jewish people during the war, advocating for their removal from the Netherlands. Mussert's political career ended when the Allies liberated the country from Nazi occupation in 1945. He was arrested and found guilty of high treason, resulting in his execution. Despite this, there remains a small number of supporters of Mussert and the NSB in the Netherlands today.</p><p>Mussert was born in Werkendam, a small town in the southern Netherlands. After studying engineering at the Delft University of Technology, he worked as a civil engineer in Rotterdam. In 1931, Mussert founded the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), which advocated for a one-party state, anti-communism, and anti-Semitism. The party gained some traction in the pre-war years, but never succeeded in achieving significant electoral success.</p><p>During World War II, Mussert collaborated with the Nazi regime and actively supported its occupation of the Netherlands. He served as a puppet of the Nazi regime, and even proposed a "European Union" under German leadership. Mussert's anti-Semitic views also became more pronounced, leading to the deportation of many Jews from the Netherlands, who were ultimately sent to concentration camps.</p><p>After the war, Mussert was arrested and tried for high treason. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad. His execution took place on May 7, 1946, in The Hague. Though Mussert's political career was marked by collaboration and support for Nazi ideology, he still has a small number of supporters and sympathizers in the Netherlands today.</p><p>Throughout his political career, Anton Mussert was known for his extreme nationalist and anti-Semitic views. He often expressed admiration for Hitler and the Nazi regime, and sought to establish a similar dictatorship in the Netherlands. Mussert was also a proponent of eugenics, and believed in the superiority of the "Aryan" race.</p><p>Despite his radical views, Mussert was able to gain some support from certain segments of Dutch society, particularly during the economic crisis of the 1930s. However, his support waned in the later years of the war, as the Dutch people began to understand the full extent of Nazi atrocities.</p><p>Mussert's trial and execution were widely publicized in the Netherlands, and he remains a controversial figure to this day. While some see him as a traitor and collaborator, others view him as a misguided idealist who was ultimately led astray by extremist ideology. Regardless of one's perspective, it is clear that Mussert played a significant role in shaping the political landscape of the Netherlands during a tumultuous period in its history.</p><p></p><p>

(November 25, 1577		Delfshaven-June 18, 1629)


was
a Dutch
pirate.


					</p><p>Piet Pieterszoon Hein is widely regarded as one of the most successful and well-respected Dutch naval commanders of the 17th century. He is best known for his daring capture of the Spanish treasure fleet in 1628 during the Eighty Years War, which greatly enriched the Dutch treasury and helped solidify the country's status as a major colonial power. Hein began his career as a merchant sailor and privateer before joining the Dutch navy in 1607. Over the course of his career, he participated in numerous naval battles and patrols in the Atlantic and Caribbean, earning a reputation for his strategic brilliance and courage under fire. Despite his success as a pirate, Hein was also known for his sense of honor and fair play, and often treated captured enemies with respect and kindness. His death at the age of 51 was widely mourned in the Netherlands, and he is remembered today as a hero of the Dutch Golden Age.</p><p>Hein's legacy as a naval hero was cemented by his bold and audacious capture of the Spanish treasure fleet, which was the largest and richest fleet to sail from the New World to Spain at that time. The treasure, which included gold, silver, and precious gems, was valued at around 11 million guilders, a fortune that greatly contributed to the Dutch war effort. The victory made Hein a national hero and earned him the nickname "the Dutch Drake" after the famous English privateer Sir Francis Drake.</p><p>Hein continued to serve in the Dutch navy and was appointed Vice Admiral of Holland in 1628. He played a key role in the Dutch victory at the Battle of the Slaak in 1631, where he commanded a fleet of warships and successfully repelled a Spanish invasion force.</p><p>Hein's legacy as a courageous and honorable commander has endured through the centuries. He has been the subject of numerous books, poems, and paintings, and his portrait hangs in the Amsterdam Rijksmuseum. In addition, a number of streets, schools, and ships have been named after him in the Netherlands.</p><p>Hein is also remembered as a pioneer in naval strategy and tactics. He is credited with developing a new technique for capturing enemy ships, known as the "boarding net," which involved using a large net to ensnare an enemy vessel's rigging and prevent it from escaping. This allowed Hein and his crew to board the ship and take control without the need for a costly and bloody battle.</p><p>In addition to his naval accomplishments, Hein was also a devout Christian and a member of the Dutch Reformed Church. He was known to carry a Bible with him on his voyages and often led his crew in prayer before battle. Despite his strong religious convictions, Hein was not above using deception and trickery to achieve his goals. He once famously disguised his ships as English vessels in order to lure a Spanish fleet into a trap.</p><p>Today, Hein is remembered as a national hero in the Netherlands and is celebrated as one of the greatest naval commanders in Dutch history. His daring exploits and strategic brilliance continue to inspire admiration and respect among historians and naval enthusiasts around the world.</p><p></p><p>
