She was a painter, sculptor, and installation artist who worked with various materials such as metal, charcoal, and glass. Her work often involved social and political commentary, showcasing her passion for political change in Colombia. Bursztyn left Colombia and went into exile in Paris after receiving threats and persecution from the Colombian government due to her political views. She continued to create and exhibit her art in France until her untimely death at the age of 48.</p><p>During her lifetime, Feliza Bursztyn left a lasting impact on the Colombian art community. She was a member of Los Independientes, a group of Colombian artists who opposed traditional artistic values and pushed boundaries in their works. Her creations were not only exhibited in Colombia but also in other parts of the world, including the United States, Mexico, and France.</p><p>Bursztyn's art was not only focused on political issues but also societal ones. One of her most well-known sculptures, "El Muro de la Patria" (The Wall of the Homeland), showcased her concerns about the impact of urbanization on the rural and indigenous communities of Colombia. She also turned her attention to environmental issues in her later work, creating sculptures made from natural materials like rock and sand.</p><p>Today, Feliza Bursztyn's legacy lives on through her art and the impact she had on the Colombian art community. Her works can be found in collections at the National Museum of Colombia, the Museum of Modern Art in Bogotá, and the Colombian Ministry of Culture.</p><p>In addition to her prolific career as an artist, Feliza Bursztyn was also a vocal advocate for women's rights and gender equality. She believed that women should have equal opportunities and representation in the art world, and often spoke out against the discrimination and marginalization that women artists faced. Bursztyn's activism and art were intertwined, as she used her creative platform to highlight the struggles of marginalized communities and to raise awareness about social and political issues in Colombia.</p><p>Bursztyn's impact on the art world has continued to grow since her death. In 2013, the Museum of Modern Art in Bogotá held a retrospective of her work, showcasing her contributions to the development of Colombian contemporary art. Her works have also been featured in several international exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale and the São Paolo Art Biennial, cementing her status as one of Colombia's most important and influential contemporary artists.</p><p>Despite the persecution she faced during her lifetime, Feliza Bursztyn remained committed to using her art to inspire change and promote social justice. Her enduring legacy continues to inspire artists and activists in Colombia and around the world.</p><p></p><p>
