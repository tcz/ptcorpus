He began his writing career as a poet, publishing his first collection in 1935. He eventually moved on to writing plays, and his play "The Great Future" became a sensation in Bulgaria, cementing his reputation as a writer. </p><p>In addition to his writing, Markovski was deeply involved in politics. He joined the Communist Party in 1944 and rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a member of parliament in 1962. His political views were often reflected in his literary works, which were marked by their socialist themes and critique of capitalism. </p><p>Despite his contributions to Bulgarian literature and culture, Markovski faced backlash from the government in the 1960s due to his outspoken views. He was briefly imprisoned in 1966 for his criticism of the regime, but was eventually released due to international pressure. </p><p>Markovski continued to write and remained active in politics until his death in 1988.
