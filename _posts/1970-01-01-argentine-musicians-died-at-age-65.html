					</p><p>Born in France, Py moved to Argentina in the late 1800s where he became interested in the developing field of cinema. He is considered one of the pioneers of Argentine cinema and is credited as the first person to create a permanent movie theater in Buenos Aires. Py directed and produced over 50 films during his career, many of which were adaptations of popular novels and plays of the time. He also worked as a cinematographer for other directors and was known for his innovative use of color and lighting in his films. In addition to his contributions to the film industry, Py was a prominent member of Buenos Aires' French community and even served as the president of the French Union in Argentina for several years.</p><p>Py's early years in Argentina were spent working as a photographer and his first foray into film was as a cinematographer for a documentary about a military parade. After this, he began to experiment with making his own films and developed a reputation as a talented director. Py's films were known for their realism and attention to detail, which was uncommon in the early days of cinema. One of his most famous films, "El Ultimo Malon" (The Last Sioux Raid), depicted the Battle of General Roca and was praised for its historical accuracy.</p><p>Py's legacy extended beyond his work in film and his contributions to the French community in Argentina. He was a member of the prestigious Argentine Academy of History and wrote extensively on the topic of cinema, including a book on the history of the medium. Py also established a school for cinematography in Buenos Aires, which trained many of the next generation's most famous Argentine filmmakers. Today, Py is remembered as a pioneer in Argentine cinema and an important figure in the country's cultural history.</p><p>Py's innovative use of color and lighting in his films was a significant contribution to the development of Argentine cinema. He experimented with techniques such as tinting and toning, which added different hues to the film and gave it a more artistic quality. Py's films were also notable for their use of natural light, which was achieved by filming on location rather than in a studio. This approach created a more authentic and believable atmosphere in his films.</p><p>In addition to his work in film, Py was an accomplished photographer and his photographs were exhibited in galleries throughout Argentina. He also served as a judge for photography competitions and was known for his expertise in the field.</p><p>Despite his success, Py faced financial difficulties throughout his career and was forced to sell his movie theater due to mounting debts.

The Eugenio Py Prize for cinematography was also established in his honor, which is awarded annually to a promising young cinematographer in Argentina.</p><p>Py's descendants have continued his legacy in the film industry, with his great-granddaughter, Eugenia Bone, becoming a prominent film producer in Argentina. The family's collection of Py's films and photographs has been preserved and digitized by the National Film and Audiovisual Archive of Argentina for future generations to study.</p><p>In recent years, Py's life and career have been the subject of several biographical works, including a documentary film and a book exploring his impact on the early days of Argentine cinema. His work continues to inspire filmmakers and cinephiles alike, cementing his place as an important figure in the history of Argentine film.</p><p>Py's impact on cinematography in Argentina was so significant that he inspired a group of filmmakers to establish the Py Group in the 1920s, which aimed to promote the use of natural light and color in film. This group had a major influence on the development of the Argentine film industry and helped to establish Buenos Aires as a hub for film production in Latin America. Py's attention to historical accuracy in his films also set a precedent for other filmmakers in Argentina, who began to prioritize research and authenticity in their own movies. Py's films were also popular beyond Argentina and were screened in countries such as Spain, France, and Italy, further contributing to their international recognition.</p><p>In addition to his work in film, Py was also involved in politics and served as a member of the municipal council in San Martin, Buenos Aires. He was a supporter of the Radical Civic Union party and used his platform as a filmmaker to promote political messages through his films.</p><p>Overall, Py's contributions to Argentine cinema were numerous and his impact on the industry was significant.

He served as the first President of Argentina from 1826 to 1827, and during his presidency, he implemented several important reforms and oversaw the drafting of the first Argentine Constitution. </p><p>Rivadavia was a proponent of modernization and sought to bring the country in line with the political and economic systems of Europe. He established the University of Buenos Aires, reformed the legal system, and abolished the Spanish Inquisition. However, his liberal ideas were not always popular, and he faced opposition from conservative factions in Argentine society. </p><p>After his presidency, Rivadavia spent several years in exile in Europe, returning to Argentina briefly in 1834 to serve as Minister of the Interior. He later moved to Spain, where he died in 1845. Despite his controversial legacy, Rivadavia remains a significant figure in Argentine history and is often credited with laying the foundations for the country's modern political and legal systems.</p><p>Rivadavia's family was of Spanish descent and held a prominent position in the local community. He studied law at the prestigious Universidad de Salamanca in Spain and returned to Argentina in 1806 to practice law. He worked as a lawyer for several years before becoming involved in politics. Rivadavia was a strong advocate for Argentine independence from Spain and actively participated in the country's struggle for independence. </p><p>In addition to his political and legal contributions, Rivadavia was also a noted intellectual and scholar. He was fluent in several languages and was interested in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, economics, and literature. He wrote extensively on these topics and was considered one of the leading intellectuals of his time.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Rivadavia's presidency was marked by controversy and conflict. His policies and reforms were met with opposition from a variety of sources, and he ultimately resigned the presidency in 1827. Rivadavia's legacy is still debated in Argentina today, with some viewing him as a visionary leader who ushered in a new era of modernization and progress, and others criticizing him for his authoritarian tendencies and disregard for democratic principles.</p><p>Rivadavia's political career was marked by both successes and challenges. In addition to serving as the first President of Argentina, he also held several other high-ranking positions within the government, including Minister of Government and Foreign Relations. He was a proponent of centralization and worked to assert the authority of the federal government over the provinces. This stance often put him at odds with local leaders, who resented the concentration of power in Buenos Aires.</p><p>Following his resignation as President, Rivadavia spent several years in exile in Europe. He traveled extensively throughout the continent and was exposed to some of the most important ideas and trends of the time. He wrote extensively during this period and continued to contribute to intellectual and political debates in Argentina.</p><p>Despite his contributions to Argentine politics and culture, Rivadavia's legacy remains controversial. Some credit him with laying the foundations for modern Argentine society, while others criticize him for his authoritarian tactics and disregard for democratic principles. Nevertheless, his impact on the country's history cannot be denied, and his name continues to be remembered and invoked in political and cultural discussions.</p><p>In addition to his political and intellectual pursuits, Bernardino Rivadavia was also a champion of the arts. He played a key role in the establishment of the country's first public library, the Biblioteca Nacional, and was a patron of Argentine writers and artists. He founded the first Argentine newspaper, the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres, which became an important forum for political debate and cultural exchange.</p><p>Rivadavia's personal life was marked by tragedy. He lost both his wife and his son at a young age, which contributed to his already melancholic disposition. Despite these setbacks, he remained committed to his political and intellectual pursuits, and continued to work tirelessly for the betterment of his country.</p><p>Today, Rivadavia is remembered as one of the most important figures in Argentine history, and his contributions to the country's political, intellectual, and cultural life are still celebrated. His name has been immortalized in numerous street names, monuments, and public institutions throughout the country, and his legacy continues to inspire future generations of Argentineans.</p><p>During his presidency, Bernardino Rivadavia was also known for his efforts to promote trade and industry in Argentina. He sought to expand the country's international trade relations and reduce its reliance on exports of raw materials. To this end, he signed several commercial treaties with European countries and encouraged the development of local manufacturing and industrial sectors.</p><p>One of Rivadavia's most significant achievements was the creation of the University of Buenos Aires, which remains one of the most prestigious universities in Latin America. He saw education as a key to modernization and progress, and believed that a strong system of higher education was essential for the country's growth and development.</p><p>Despite his progressive views on many issues, Rivadavia was also criticized for his treatment of indigenous peoples and his support of slavery. He believed that indigenous communities should be assimilated into mainstream Argentine society, and his policies towards these communities were often paternalistic and discriminatory. Similarly, he was a long-time advocate of slavery and saw it as necessary for the country's agricultural development.</p><p>Despite these shortcomings, Bernardino Rivadavia remains an important figure in Argentine history, and his contributions to the country's intellectual, cultural, and political life continue to be celebrated. He is seen as a complex and multifaceted figure, whose legacy is still being debated and analyzed by scholars and historians today.</p><p></p><p>
