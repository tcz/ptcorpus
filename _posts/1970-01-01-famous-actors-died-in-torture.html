In 1943, he was captured by the Gestapo and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp.</p><p>Itkine's experience in the camps was brutal, and he suffered from malnutrition and disease during his time there. Despite these hardships, he was able to continue working on his art, writing plays and developing new film ideas. However, his time in the camps was short-lived, and he was eventually moved to the prison in Fresnes, where he was executed in August 1944.</p><p>Despite his tragic end, Sylvain Itkine's legacy as an artist and activist continues to inspire those in the theatre and film community. His contributions to French cinema, in particular, have been celebrated for their innovative use of technology and incorporation of modern themes.
