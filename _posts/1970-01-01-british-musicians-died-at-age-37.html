Along with fellow explorer Richard Burton, Speke traveled extensively throughout East Africa in the mid-19th century, documenting the flora and fauna and the customs of the local populations. </p><p>Despite his successes as an explorer, Speke's legacy is somewhat controversial, as his claims about the source of the Nile were disputed by Burton and other explorers at the time.
