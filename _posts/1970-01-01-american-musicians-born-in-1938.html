He was approached by the league in 1969 to create a new logo and his design has since become one of the most recognizable logos in sports.</p><p>Outside of basketball, West has been open about his struggles with depression and anxiety. In his autobiography, he revealed that he has sought therapy and medication to manage his mental health. He has also been an advocate for mental health awareness and has used his platform to encourage others to seek help if they need it.</p><p>Later in his career, Jerry West became the coach of the Lakers in 1976, leading them to the playoffs in his first season.

He has also made an impact in the business side of the game, serving as a consultant for several NBA teams after his retirement from the Lakers' front office. Additionally, he has been an analyst for ESPN and TNT and has written several books on basketball.</p><p>West's impact on the game has not gone unnoticed, with many players and coaches citing him as an inspiration. In fact, the NBA logo that he designed is not the only lasting tribute to him. The NBA Finals MVP award has also been named after him, with the trophy being called the "Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award" since 2009.</p><p>Despite all of his accomplishments, West remains humble and grateful for his success. In his autobiography, he wrote, "I'm not trying to convince anyone that I'm a great person, just a lucky one. Lucky to have been born with the ability to play basketball, and lucky to have played for the Lakers, coached the Lakers, and ultimately helped build a great Lakers team as a general manager."</p><p>Jerry West's legacy in basketball and beyond will continue to be felt for generations to come.</p><p></p><p>
