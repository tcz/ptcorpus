Mirjan's poetry, which was often political in nature, expressed his love for his country and his desire for its independence. He also translated works by other famous poets, including William Shakespeare and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, into Arabic.</p><p>Mirjan's dedication to Iraqi culture and identity also extended to the preservation of ancient artifacts and archaeological sites. He was a lifelong supporter of the Iraq Museum and played a key role in securing funding for its expansion in the 1950s.</p><p>Despite facing numerous challenges throughout his career, Abdul-Wahab Mirjan remained a committed nationalist and advocate for Iraqi independence until his death.
