Süssmayr was a student of Mozart and worked as his assistant for several years. He also composed his own music, which includes several operas, church music, and instrumental works. Despite his contributions to Mozart's Requiem, Süssmayr's work has often been criticized for not being true to Mozart's style. Süssmayr died at the age of 37 in Vienna, and his legacy as a composer continues to be debated by music scholars.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=623865" title="Wikipedia article about Franz Xaver Süssmayr">Franz Xaver Süssmayr on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Erwin Schulhoff</h2><p><strong>Erwin Schulhoff</strong>

						Schulhoff was born in Prague in 1894 to a German-Jewish family with a musical background. He began his music education at a young age, starting with the piano and moving on to composition. His early works were influenced by the Romantic tradition but his style evolved to include a wide range of musical styles, including jazz and futurism.</p><p>In addition to his work as a composer, Schulhoff was also a performer and a conductor. He played piano in jazz bands and performed his own works. He was also involved in the Marxist movement and his political beliefs influenced his music, particularly in his later works.</p><p>During World War II, Schulhoff was arrested by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp. He died in 1942 in Weißenburg in Bayern, while being transported to a different camp. After his death, much of his music was lost, but in recent years there has been renewed interest in his work, particularly as part of the Czech Degenerate Music movement.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=2579410" title="Wikipedia article about Erwin Schulhoff">Erwin Schulhoff on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/serbian-musicians-died-at-age-30.html' title='Serbian musicians died at age 30'><strong>Serbian musicians died at age 30</strong> List of the top 2 Serbian music stars who died when they were 30</a></li><li><a href='/chinese-actors-died-in-liver-tumour.html' title='Chinese actors died in Liver tumour'><strong>Chinese actors died in Liver tumour</strong> List of the top 1 Chinese actors who died in Liver tumour</a></li><li><a href='/jamaican-musicians-died-at-age-44.html' title='Jamaican musicians died at age 44'><strong>Jamaican musicians died at age 44</strong> List of the top 2 Jamaican music stars who died when they were 44</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/czech-actors-died-in-brain-tumor.html' title='Czech actors died in Brain tumor'><strong>Czech actors died in Brain tumor</strong> List of the top 1 Czech actors who died in Brain tumor</a></li><li><a href='/cuban-musicians-died-at-age-27.html' title='Cuban musicians died at age 27'><strong>Cuban musicians died at age 27</strong> List of the top 1 Cuban music stars who died when they were 27</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-musicians-died-at-age-69.html' title='Austrian musicians died at age 69'><strong>Austrian musicians died at age 69</strong> List of the top 11 Austrian music stars who died when they were 69</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
