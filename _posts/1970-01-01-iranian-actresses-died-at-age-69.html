							Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari was best known for her brief marriage to the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1951. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1958 due to Soraya's inability to produce an heir to the throne. After the divorce, Soraya lived mainly in Europe where she pursued her interests in acting and writing. She appeared in a few films and wrote several books on her life and experiences, including her autobiography "The Palace of Solitude." Despite being stripped of her royal titles following the divorce, Soraya remained a beloved figure in Iran and was often referred to as Princess Soraya by her fans. She died in Paris in 2001 at the age of 69.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=287428" title="Wikipedia article about Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari">Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actresses-born-in-1935.html' title='American actresses born in 1935'><strong>American actresses born in 1935</strong> List of the top 46 American actresses who were born in 1935</a></li><li><a href='/west-german-actresses-died-in-1980.html' title='West German actresses died in 1980'><strong>West German actresses died in 1980</strong> List of the top 1 West German actresses who died in 1980</a></li><li><a href='/argentine-actresses-died-in-1986.html' title='Argentine actresses died in 1986'><strong>Argentine actresses died in 1986</strong> List of the top 1 Argentine actresses who died in 1986</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-meningitis.html' title='Famous musicians died in Meningitis'><strong>Famous musicians died in Meningitis</strong> List of the top 7 Famous music stars who died in Meningitis</a></li><li><a href='/cypriot-musicians-died-at-age-41.html' title='Cypriot musicians died at age 41'><strong>Cypriot musicians died at age 41</strong> List of the top 1 Cypriot music stars who died when they were 41</a></li><li><a href='/indonesian-actresses-born-in-1963.html' title='Indonesian actresses born in 1963'><strong>Indonesian actresses born in 1963</strong> List of the top 7 Indonesian actresses who were born in 1963</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
