He studied medicine in Portugal and later worked as a physician in Angola, where he became involved in the anti-colonial movement. Neto founded the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) in 1956, which was one of the three main liberation movements fighting against Portuguese colonial rule.

As part of this effort, Neto established the National Institute for Education in Angola, which provided free education to all citizens.
