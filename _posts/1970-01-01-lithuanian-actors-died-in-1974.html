His given name was actually Abram, but he later changed it to Alfred. At the age of 16, he joined a traveling theater troupe and began performing in Yiddish-language productions throughout Eastern Europe. He later studied acting in Moscow and Kiev, honing his craft and perfecting his skills.In the early 1930s, Lodzinski moved to Warsaw, where he became a member of the Ateneum Theater ensemble.
