(April 2, 1565		Gouda-September 1, 1599			Aceh Sultanate)


was
a Dutch
personality.


					</p><p>He was a trader, explorer, and navigator who is best known for leading the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies. In 1592, he and his brother Frederik were sent by Amsterdam merchants to find a new spice route to the East Indies, as the Portuguese controlled the existing route at the time. </p><p>After a long and dangerous journey, Houtman arrived in Bantam, Java in 1596, where he successfully traded for spices and built relations with local rulers. He then returned to the Netherlands with a cargo worth 400 percent of the expedition's costs, making a huge profit for the merchants who had funded the expedition.</p><p>Houtman's success paved the way for further Dutch involvement in the East Indies, which eventually led to the formation of the Dutch East India Company. However, Houtman himself did not live to see the company's establishment, as he was killed by the Samudera Pasai Sultanate in Aceh while on a later trading mission in 1599.</p><p>His death was due to a combination of factors, including a possible misunderstanding of cultural differences and a lack of diplomatic skills. Despite his untimely demise, Houtman's name remains associated with the early voyages of Dutch exploration and trade in the East Indies. His legacy also includes the Houtman Abrolhos islands off the western coast of Australia, which were named in his honor by Dutch navigators who sailed through the area during the 17th century. Houtman's story is an important part of Dutch colonial history and a testament to the bravery and resourcefulness of early European explorers.</p><p></p><p>
