(March 26, 1861		Tokyo-March 28, 1930)

	
		a.k.a. Uchimura Kanzo or Kanzō Uchimura

	
was
a Japanese
writer and peace activist.


					</p><p>He is known for his contributions to Japanese Christianity, as he played a significant role in the early development of the Japanese Christian Church. Uchimura was also a prolific writer who authored more than 100 books, including volumes on theology, philosophy, and literature. His literary works were deeply rooted in Japanese traditions and aimed to bridge the gap between Eastern and Western cultures. In addition to his contributions to Christianity and literature, Uchimura was a strong advocate for peace and promoted pacifism throughout his life. He founded the Non-Church Movement, a movement aimed at promoting individual conscience over institutional authority in matters of religion. Uchimura's legacy continues to inspire Japanese Christians and peace activists to this day.</p><p>Uchimura Kanzō was born into a samurai family in Tokyo and grew up during a time of great social and political change in Japan. He studied at the prestigious Tokyo Imperial University but eventually dropped out due to his disillusionment with the traditional education system. After questioning his Christian faith, he began to develop his own theology, which emphasized the importance of a personal relationship with God and rejected the idea of churches and denominations. </p><p>Despite his unorthodox views, Uchimura became a prominent figure in the Japanese Christian community and was instrumental in helping to establish the Christian Student Association, which played a key role in bringing Christianity to Japanese universities. He also founded the first Christian newspaper in Japan, The Japan Christian Advocate, which helped to spread his ideas and promote the Christian faith in Japan. </p><p>In addition to his religious work, Uchimura was deeply committed to promoting social justice and was an outspoken critic of Japan's militaristic government. He opposed Japan's involvement in World War I and was a vocal supporter of the League of Nations, believing in the importance of international cooperation and peace. </p><p>In his final years, Uchimura suffered from poor health and financial difficulties, but his legacy continues to live on. He is remembered today as one of the most influential thinkers and writers of early 20th-century Japan and a pioneer in the development of Japanese Christianity.</p><p>Uchimura Kanzō was also known for his proficiency in English, having learned the language during his studies at the Tokyo Imperial University. His English skills allowed him to translate many important works of Western literature and philosophy into Japanese, making them more accessible to Japanese readers. Uchimura was particularly interested in the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson and translated several of his essays into Japanese, which greatly influenced his own philosophical ideas. He also traveled extensively throughout his life, visiting countries such as England, America, and China, and his experiences abroad helped shape his views on global issues and the importance of cultural exchange. Uchimura's Non-Church Movement continues to have a significant impact on Japanese Christianity today, as many Japanese Christians continue to prioritize individual conscience and a personal relationship with God over institutional authority. His writings and ideas continue to be studied and debated, and his legacy as a writer, thinker, and peace activist lives on in Japan and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
