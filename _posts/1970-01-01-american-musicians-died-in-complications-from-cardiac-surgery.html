						</p><p>Armstrong began his career as a naval aviator and served in the Korean War. He then joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which later became NASA, and became a test pilot at the Armstrong Flight Research Center. He was selected by NASA in 1962 to be part of the second group of astronauts, known as the New Nine. </p><p>On July 20, 1969, Armstrong became the first person to step onto the moon, famously proclaiming "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." He and fellow astronaut Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin spent two and a half hours walking on the moon's surface, while Michael Collins orbited above. Armstrong retired from NASA in 1971 and became a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati. </p><p>In addition to his groundbreaking work as an astronaut and pilot, Armstrong also served on various commissions and was awarded numerous honors during his lifetime, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. He passed away in 2012 at the age of 82.</p><p>During his lifetime, Neil Armstrong received numerous honors for his work as an astronaut and pilot. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. Armstrong also received the Robert J. Collier Trophy, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, and the Elliott Cresson Medal from the Franklin Institute. In addition to his work in aviation and space exploration, Armstrong was also actively involved in the Boy Scouts of America and served as a member of its National Executive Board. After retiring from NASA, he became a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati and served on various commissions and advisory groups. Armstrong suffered from heart complications and underwent bypass surgery in August 2012, just days before his death on August 25, 2012, at the age of 82.</p><p>Armstrong's journey to become an astronaut started in 1955 when he applied to the astronaut training program but was turned down because NASA was only accepting test pilots at the time. Armstrong became a test pilot and applied again in 1962, being accepted as part of NASA's second group of astronauts. Before stepping onto the moon, Armstrong had to manually land the lunar module, known as Eagle, after encountering a rocky and boulder-filled terrain. His calm and precise handling of the situation ensured the success of the mission. After his historic moon landing, Armstrong played a key role in investigating the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster as part of the Rogers Commission. Armstrong's contributions to aerospace and space exploration have been legendary, and he will always be remembered as one of humanity's most celebrated heroes.</p><p>Armstrong's legacy extends beyond his monumental achievement of being the first human to set foot on the moon. He was deeply committed to advancing the field of aviation and space exploration, and was a tireless advocate for science education. In addition to his teaching and advisory work, Armstrong also served as a member of the board of directors for several companies, including Learjet and Cincinnati Bell. He was also the author of several books, including his memoir, "First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong," which was published in 2005. Armstrong's impact on American culture and history is immeasurable, and his courage and pioneering spirit continue to inspire generations of people around the world.</p><p>Armstrong's interest in aviation and space began at a young age, when he earned his pilot's license at the age of 16, before he even had a driver's license. He later studied aeronautical engineering at Purdue University, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1955. During his time as a naval aviator, Armstrong flew 78 combat missions in the Korean War and was awarded several honors for his service, including the Air Medal and the Gold Star. </p><p>After retiring from NASA, Armstrong largely withdrew from public life, preferring to maintain a low profile. However, he remained active in various philanthropic causes and served as a member of the board of directors for several organizations, including the Mayo Clinic and the National Museum of Natural History. In recent years, he also became involved in efforts to promote space exploration and encourage the next generation of scientists and engineers. </p><p>Throughout his career, Armstrong remained humble about his accomplishments, often deflecting attention and credit for his achievements. In a statement released upon his death, his family recalled his famous words upon stepping onto the moon: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," and added that he "savored his privacy and was always modest, self-effacing and gracious, with a disarming sense of humor." Armstrong's impact on science, technology, and exploration will be felt for generations to come, and his legacy as one of the most celebrated heroes of our time is secure.</p><p>Armstrong's love for flying and space exploration led him to become a part of many organizations and missions throughout his career. After retiring from NASA and teaching at the University of Cincinnati, he became the chairman of Computing Technologies for Aviation (CTA), a company that developed computer software for pilots. He was also a member of the National Commission on Space, which was created to provide recommendations for the future of the US space program. Additionally, Armstrong served as the honorary chairman of the National Space Society, an organization dedicated to the exploration and development of space resources. He also joined the board of directors for Marathon Oil, Gates Learjet, and United Airlines. Armstrong's commitment to advancing aviation and space exploration continued until his death, and his contributions to these fields still inspire people around the world.</p><p></p><p>
