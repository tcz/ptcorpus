(February 7, 1889		Salzburg-February 26, 1952)


was
an Austrian
sculptor.


					</p><p>He is mainly known for his monumental sculptures which were created during the period of the Third Reich. Thorak was a prominent figure of the Nazi art scene and was one of the favorite sculptors of Adolf Hitler. Under Hitler's patronage, Thorak created several large-scale sculptures that celebrated Nazi ideals of heroism, power, and strength. Some of his most famous works include the "Comradeship" statue that was erected in Berlin's New Reich Chancellery, and the "Wehrmacht" statue on the Kroll Opera House in Berlin. Following World War II, Thorak was charged with de-Nazification and spent some time in Allied custody. Many of his works were destroyed, while some were smuggled out of Germany and are now in private collections or museums.</p><p>During his early years, Thorak trained with sculptors in Austria and Germany. He moved to Munich in 1910, where he perfected his craft and became a successful artist. In the 1920s, he was commissioned to create several public sculptures and monuments, including the "Hermann von Wissmann" monument in Chiemsee. </p><p>Thorak was a fierce advocate for the idea of "Grossplastik" - large-scale sculptures that celebrated the Nazi ideology of Aryan superiority, strength, and heroism. He believed that these sculptures had immense power to shape the public imagination and inspire loyalty and devotion to the Nazi cause. </p><p>During World War II, Thorak was given a lot of work by the Nazi government. In addition to creating monumental sculptures, he also designed medals and other honors for the German military. He was known for his sculptural representation of Nazi ideology and his works became some of the most recognizable symbols of the Third Reich. </p><p>Following the war, Thorak was arrested and faced trial for his association with the Nazi regime. He was initially sentenced to 25 years in prison but was released in 1951 after serving only five years. Thorak died shortly after his release from prison due to complications from a stroke. Today, his works are a subject of controversy and debate, with some arguing that they should be destroyed and others arguing that they are important historical artifacts that should be preserved.</p><p></p><p>

(February 12, 1851		Brno-August 27, 1914			Vienna)

	
		a.k.a. Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk, Eugen Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen von Boehm-Bawerk or Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk

	
was
an Austrian
economist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on the theory of capital and interest rates, in which he argued that the interest rate is determined by the interplay of supply and demand in the market for loans. Böhm-Bawerk was a prominent member of the Austrian School of economics, which emphasized the importance of free markets and individual liberty in economic affairs. In addition to his academic work, he served as a member of the Austrian parliament and as Minister of Finance in the early 1900s. His contributions to the field of economics were influential in shaping the development of modern economics, particularly in the areas of price theory and capital theory.</p><p>Böhm-Bawerk was born in Brno, in what is now the Czech Republic, to a prominent family. He graduated from the University of Vienna with a law degree in 1872, but his interests soon turned to economics. He became a disciple of Carl Menger, the founder of the Austrian School of economics, and played a key role in spreading Menger's ideas.</p><p>One of Böhm-Bawerk's most significant contributions to economics was his three-volume work, "Capital and Interest," which was published between 1884 and 1899. In this work, he developed the concept of time preference, which refers to the fact that people generally prefer to have goods now rather than in the future. He argued that this preference for present goods over future goods is what gives rise to the interest rate. This idea helped to distinguish the Austrian School from classical economics, which saw interest rates as being determined by the productivity of capital.</p><p>Böhm-Bawerk's work on capital theory also helped to lay the foundation for the Austrian theory of the business cycle. He argued that the injection of credit into the economy by banks could result in an artificial boom, but that this would eventually lead to a bust as resources became misallocated. This view was later developed by other Austrian economists, such as Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek.</p><p>In addition to his academic work, Böhm-Bawerk was involved in politics. He served as a member of the Austrian parliament from 1895 to 1904, and as Minister of Finance from 1900 to 1904. He was also instrumental in the founding of the Austrian School's leading institution, the Austrian Institute for Economic Research (WIFO), which was established in 1926.</p><p>Böhm-Bawerk died in 1914, just as World War I was beginning. Despite his relatively short life, his contributions to economics continue to influence the field to this day.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Dr. Rudolf Hilferding

	
was
an Austrian
politician, economist and physician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his influential work "Finance Capital" (1910), which identified the growing power and influence of finance capital in industrial economies. Hilferding was also a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and served as a member of the Reichstag from 1924 to 1928. He was forced to flee Germany in 1933 due to his Jewish background and socialist political beliefs, and spent the rest of his life in exile in France, where he continued to write and advocate for socialism. Hilferding died by suicide in 1941, after being arrested by the Vichy government and facing deportation to Nazi-occupied Germany. His work on finance capital and Marxist theory continues to be influential in economic and political thought today.</p><p>In addition to "Finance Capital," Hilferding also wrote several other influential works, including "Theorie des Geldes," which examined the role of money in capitalist economies, and "Das Finanzkapital," which built on the ideas presented in "Finance Capital" and further explored the relationship between finance capital and imperialism. </p><p>Hilferding was also a prominent member of the German Communist Party during his early political career, but later joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany, where he became a leading figure in the party's left-wing. He advocated for a more radical, socialist agenda within the party, and was instrumental in shaping the SPD's economic policies during the 1920s.</p><p>Despite facing persecution and exile, Hilferding continued to write and publish works on Marxist theory and economic policy. He was a strong advocate for international socialism and argued against sectarianism and dogmatism within the socialist movement.</p><p>Today, Hilferding's work remains relevant and continues to be studied by economists and political scientists. His contributions to Marxist theory, particularly his analysis of the role of finance capital in capitalist economies, have had a lasting impact on socialist thought and economic policy.</p><p></p><p>

He also believed that protocol sentences could be used to describe observations in a scientific experiment, allowing scientists to more accurately record and understand their results. </p><p>Neurath's work on statistical graphics and isotype was groundbreaking. He believed that data could be visualized in a way that was accessible to people who were not trained in statistics or mathematics. His isotype method used icons to represent data, making it easier to understand complex information. Neurath worked on many projects that used his isotype method, including a visual encyclopedia and an exhibition on the history of science.</p><p>In addition to his academic work, Neurath was involved in various social and political movements.
