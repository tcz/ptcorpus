(July 17, 1901		Klimontów, Sandomierz County-September 17, 1938			Butyrka prison)

	
		a.k.a. Bruno Jasienski

	
was
a Polish
writer.


					</p><p>He was a prominent figure in Polish Futurist literature, known for his works that explored themes of industrialization, revolution, and the socio-political climate of his time. Jasieński's most famous work is the novel "I Burn Paris," a surreal and dystopian account of a worker's revolt in France. He actively participated in leftist political movements and was a member of the Communist Party of Poland. Jasieński emigrated to the Soviet Union in 1937 but was arrested during the Great Purge and sentenced to death. He was executed in 1938 and rehabilitated posthumously in 1956. Jasieński's writings, which were banned in Poland during the communist era, have since been recognized as an important contribution to Polish literature and avant-garde thought.</p><p>Jasieński was born into a Jewish family and grew up in the city of Łódź, where he became involved in the local Futurist movement. He published his first collection of poetry, "Pięć kołków" ("Five Spikes"), in 1922, and went on to write several other collections of poetry and prose before publishing "I Burn Paris" in 1928. The novel was immediately controversial and was banned in Poland for its leftist themes and graphic sexual content. </p><p>Jasieński was a prolific writer who also worked as a journalist and translator. He translated many works of Soviet literature into Polish, including works by Mayakovsky and Gorky. He was also involved in the film industry, writing scripts and working on productions. </p><p>Despite his success as a writer, Jasieński's political activities and Communist Party membership put him in danger during the Stalinist era. After his arrest, he was subjected to brutal interrogations and forced to confess to trumped-up charges of anti-Soviet activity. His execution caused shockwaves within the Polish literary community, many of whom had been inspired by his work and activism. </p><p>Jasieński's legacy has been the subject of much debate and interpretation. Some view him as a radical visionary who used the power of language to critique the oppressive forces of industrialization and political coercion. Others see him as a naive idealist who was sucked into the Soviet propaganda machine and ultimately paid the price for his illusions. Regardless of one's perspective, it is clear that Jasieński's writings continue to resonate with readers who recognize the urgent need for social change in our own times.</p><p></p><p>

(December 14, 1865		Congress Poland-April 7, 1903			London)

	
		otherwise known as Seweryn Antonowicz Kłosowski, Ludwig Schloski or Dr. George Chapman

	
was
a Polish
physician.


					</p><p>After emigrating to England in the early 1890s, George Chapman worked odd jobs and married a woman named Lucy Baderski. However, he also had a dark side and was suspected of being a serial killer. In 1902, he was arrested and charged with poisoning three of his wives, although he was only convicted of killing one of them. Chapman was hanged for his crime in 1903. His case was notable for being one of the first to use forensic evidence, including toxicology tests, to secure a murder conviction.</p><p>Chapman's childhood was marred by poverty, abuse, and neglect. His mother abandoned the family when he was young, and his father, a carpenter, struggled to provide for his children. Chapman was reportedly a sickly child and had a twin brother who died at an early age. Despite his difficult upbringing, Chapman showed an early aptitude for medicine and trained as a physician in Poland before moving to England.</p><p>Chapman's first marriage was to a woman named Annie Chapman, who was one of the victims of infamous serial killer Jack the Ripper. Although Chapman was never suspected of being the Ripper, his connection to one of the victims added to his notoriety. Chapman's second and third wives also died under suspicious circumstances, leading to his arrest.</p><p>During his trial, it was revealed that Chapman had a history of violence towards women and had beaten his wives on multiple occasions. He was also found to have purchased large quantities of poison, which he used to kill one of his wives. Chapman denied the charges against him, but the evidence was overwhelming, and he was found guilty of murder.</p><p>Chapman's case was widely covered in the press and sparked public outrage. His execution was attended by a large crowd, and his last words were reportedly "I am innocent." Despite his protestations, Chapman is widely believed to have been a serial killer who preyed on women.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by hanging.
