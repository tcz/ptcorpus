									</h1><p>Here are 3 famous musicians from Denmark died at 34:</p><h2>Stellan Rye</h2><p><strong>Stellan Rye</strong>
(July 4, 1880		Randers-November 14, 1914			France)


was
a Danish
film director and screenwriter.


					</p><p>He is known for directing the 1913 film "Atlantis," which is considered a masterpiece of Danish cinema. Rye began his career in the theatre, where he worked as both an actor and a director, before making the transition to film. He directed several films for the Danish film company Nordisk Film, and was a key figure in the development of Danish silent cinema. Rye's untimely death at the age of 34, while serving as a member of the French Foreign Legion during World War I, cut short what promised to be a truly remarkable career. Despite his brief time in the film industry, Stellan Rye is remembered as one of the pioneers of Danish cinema and a significant figure in the early history of film.</p><p>Rye was born to a family of actors and performers, and his parents encouraged him to pursue a career in the arts from a young age. After completing his education, he joined a travelling theatre company and performed extensively throughout Denmark and Germany. In 1908, he was hired by Nordisk Film, and began working as an actor in their productions.</p><p>Rye's talent as a director quickly became apparent, and he was given the opportunity to helm his first film in 1910. He quickly established himself as one of the leading directors at Nordisk, and was known for his attention to detail and innovative camera techniques. His films often explored themes of love, loyalty, and betrayal, and were praised for their striking visuals and emotional depth.</p><p>After the outbreak of World War I, Rye enlisted in the French Foreign Legion, believing that it was his duty to fight for his adopted country. Tragically, he was killed in action just a few months later, leaving behind a wife and child. Today, he is remembered as one of the most influential filmmakers of the silent era, and his work continues to inspire new generations of filmmakers in Denmark and beyond.</p><p></p><p>

(August 5, 1737		Halle-April 28, 1772			Copenhagen)

	
		a.k.a. Count Johann Friedrich Struensee

	
was
a Danish
politician and physician.


					
			
		His child
		is
		called
		Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark.

						</p><p>Struensee was a controversial figure in Denmark during the late 18th century. He rose to power as the personal physician of King Christian VII, and eventually became the de facto ruler of Denmark. Struensee implemented a number of progressive reforms during his time in power, including the abolition of torture and serfdom, and the promotion of religious toleration and education.</p><p>Despite his successes, Struensee faced significant opposition from the Danish nobility, who resented his influence over the king. In 1772, he was arrested and charged with a range of crimes, including adultery and lèse-majesté (insulting the king). He was found guilty and sentenced to death, and was executed by decapitation on April 28, 1772.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Struensee is remembered as an important reformer in Danish history. His efforts paved the way for later social and political changes in Denmark, and he remains an intriguing figure for historians and scholars to this day.</p><p>In addition to his reforms, Struensee also had a close relationship with Queen Caroline Matilda, the wife of King Christian VII. Rumors of an affair between them circulated at the time and have persisted in historical accounts. Some scholars have suggested that Struensee's relationship with the queen may have contributed to his downfall, as it further alienated him from the nobility and other powerful factions.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his personal life, Struensee's political legacy is significant. He was a champion of Enlightenment ideals and sought to modernize and liberalize Danish society. His reforms laid the groundwork for later reforms in areas such as education, criminal justice, and civic rights.</p><p>Struensee's story has been the subject of numerous books, plays, and films. He is often portrayed as a tragic figure who, despite his best intentions, was ultimately undone by his own ambition and the machinations of those who opposed him.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by decapitation.
