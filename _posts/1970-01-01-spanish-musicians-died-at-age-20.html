					</p><p>Born in Córdoba, Spain, Ángel Crespo was a prominent poet, literary critic, translator and journalist. His passion for literature started at an early age and he went on to become a central figure in the Spanish literary scene during the 1950s and 1960s. He was an integral part of the literary circle known as the 'Generation of 1950', which included eminent writers such as Jaime Gil de Biedma and Claudio Rodríguez.</p><p>Crespo was also an accomplished translator, introducing the works of many great poets from around the world to a Spanish audience. He translated the works of poets like Arthur Rimbaud, Walt Whitman, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and Joseph Brodsky.</p><p>In addition to his literary pursuits, Ángel Crespo was also a respected journalist, working for some of the most prestigious publications in Spain. He wrote extensively on politics, culture and arts, and served as the editor for numerous literary magazines.</p><p>Crespo's contribution to Spanish literature and culture saw him receive many accolades during his lifetime, including the National Spanish Critic Award, the National Translation Award, and the National Prize for Spanish Literature. Despite his extraordinary literary accomplishments, Crespo led a very humble life and always remained deeply rooted in his Andalusian origins.</p><p>Throughout his literary career, Crespo published numerous collections of poetry, including "Las formas del fuego" and "Fin de un amor". He was also the author of critical works such as "Las tentaciones del fracaso" and "Esperando a los bárbaros: Ensayos 1953-1993". As a translator, he was highly regarded for his ability to convey the nuances and spirit of the original works in his renderings. He also played a vital role in bringing Hispanic poetry to the attention of global audiences.</p><p>Apart from his literary and journalistic work, Crespo was also an influential figure in the Spanish cultural institutions. He was a member of the Spanish Royal Academy and was a professor of Spanish Literature at the Complutense University of Madrid. He was highly respected by his students and colleagues alike, and his influence continued to be felt long after his death.</p><p>Ángel Crespo passed away on April 5, 1995, in Madrid, Spain, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire Spanish literature and culture. His contributions to Spanish literature, poetry, and translation have earned him a place among the most important Spanish writers of the 20th century.</p><p>In addition to his accolades and achievements in the literary world, Ángel Crespo was also known for his political activism. He was a member of the Spanish Communist Party and was involved in anti-Francoist activities in the 1940s and 1950s. He was imprisoned for his political beliefs and spent time in several prisons across Spain. Despite this, he remained committed to his beliefs and continued to write and speak out on political issues throughout his life. His experiences as a political prisoner and his passion for social justice are reflected in his works, which often explore themes of oppression, resistance, and hope.</p><p>Crespo's legacy as a translator is particularly noteworthy. His translations of Rimbaud, Whitman, and other poets were highly praised for their accuracy and poetic resonance. According to fellow translator Margaret Jull Costa, "Crespo's translations were notable for their combination of erudition and lyricism, always trying to keep the spirit of the original intact." His translations helped to introduce these poets to a wider Spanish-speaking audience and inspired many Spanish poets who followed in his footsteps.</p><p>Today, Ángel Crespo is remembered as one of the most important figures in contemporary Spanish literature. His legacy as a poet, literary critic, translator, journalist, and political activist remains a source of inspiration for many aspiring writers and intellectuals.</p><p></p><p>
