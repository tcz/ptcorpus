was
an Egyptian
personality.


					</p><p>Mohammed Helmy was an Egyptian physician who is known for his heroism during World War II. He saved the lives of several Jewish people in Nazi-occupied Germany by providing them with medical care and hiding them from the authorities. Despite the risks to his own life, Helmy refused to reveal the hiding places of those he was helping. He was recognized by Yad Vashem in 2013 as a "Righteous Among the Nations" for his bravery and compassion.</p><p>Mohammed Helmy was born on July 25, 1901, in Khartoum, Sudan, which was then a part of Egypt. He was of Turkish descent and later moved to Germany in the 1920s, where he studied medicine and worked as a physician. During World War II, he converted his own medical office into a hiding place for Jews seeking refuge from the Nazi regime. He also assisted them with obtaining forged identification papers and finding safe places to stay.</p><p>Helmy left Germany in 1959 and returned to Egypt, where he eventually became the head of the Department of Medicine at a hospital in Cairo. Despite his heroic actions during the war, his story remained relatively unknown until the early 2010s when a German researcher uncovered information about his activities and began advocating for him to be recognized for his bravery. Helmy died in 1982 in Cairo, but his legacy lives on as a shining example of selflessness and compassion in the face of great adversity.</p><p></p><p>
