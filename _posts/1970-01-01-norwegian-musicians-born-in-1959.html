						</p><p>musician and songwriter. He is best known as the co-founder and guitarist of the black metal band Mayhem. Jevanord was born in Bergen, Norway and formed Mayhem in 1984 with bassist Necrobutcher and drummer Kjetil Manheim. The band gained notoriety in the 1990s for their involvement in the Norwegian black metal scene, which was associated with church burnings and murders. Jevanord played on Mayhem's influential 1994 album "De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas" before departing the band in 1995. He went on to form the bands Kvislingsskog and Orcustus, and has also collaborated with other black metal musicians such as Satyr of Satyricon. Jevanord is considered one of the pioneers of Norwegian black metal and his contributions to the genre have had a significant impact on heavy metal music as a whole.</p><p>Jevanord's interest in music started at a young age, and he quickly became drawn to heavy metal and rock music. He picked up the guitar in his early teenage years and started to play in bands. Despite being known for his work in Mayhem and the black metal scene, Jevanord has a diverse range of musical influences, including classical music, jazz, and blues.</p><p>Jevanord's time in Mayhem was tumultuous, with multiple lineup changes and personal conflicts within the band. However, their music and legacy have endured, with "De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas" being regarded as a classic album in the black metal genre.</p><p>After leaving Mayhem, Jevanord continued to pursue music with his bands Kvislingsskog and Orcustus. Both bands have released critically acclaimed albums and have been praised for their intense and brutal sound.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding the early days of the Norwegian black metal scene, Jevanord has since disavowed violence and criminal behavior. He has focused on his music career and is respected for his contributions to the genre.</p><p></p><p>
