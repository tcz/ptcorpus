He was deeply influenced by poets such as Keats and Shelley, and his writing style reflects a poetic sensibility that is rare in American fiction. Fitzgerald's writing is known for its elegant prose, vivid descriptions, and sharp social commentary.</p><p>Despite his struggles with alcoholism and financial difficulties, Fitzgerald remained dedicated to his craft. In the years leading up to his death, he was working on a new novel, "The Last Tycoon," which was left unfinished at the time of his death. The novel was posthumously published and remains a testament to Fitzgerald's talent and vision as a writer.</p><p>Today, Fitzgerald's works continue to be studied and celebrated around the world.

writer, philosopher and poet.


					</p><p>Thoreau was best known for his book "Walden," which is a reflection upon the two years he spent living in a cabin by Walden Pond. He was also famous for his essay "Civil Disobedience," which advocated for individual resistance to unjust laws. Thoreau was deeply influenced by the natural world, and his ideas about simplicity, self-reliance and non-conformity continue to inspire. He was also an advocate for the abolition of slavery and an early environmentalist. Thoreau is considered one of the most important figures in American Transcendentalism.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Thoreau worked as a surveyor and a handyman. He was also a passionate abolitionist and an active participant in the Underground Railroad, helping slaves escape to freedom. Thoreau's political views were shaped by his belief in individual freedom and his opposition to unjust institutions such as slavery and government corruption. He was a strong supporter of the concept of civil disobedience and believed that individuals had a moral duty to stand up against oppressive laws. Thoreau's work has had a profound influence on American literature and culture, and many people consider him to be an American icon.</p><p>Thoreau's legacy has continued to inspire generations of writers, activists, and environmentalists. His love for nature and his commitment to preserving the environment were ahead of his time, and he is often seen as a pioneer of the modern environmental movement. Thoreau's ideas about non-conformity and individual liberty have also continued to influence modern philosophers and political theorists.</p><p>Despite his impact on American culture, during his lifetime Thoreau struggled to gain recognition as a writer. It was not until many years after his death that his work gained widespread recognition and acclaim.</p><p>Today, Thoreau is remembered as a visionary who challenged the status quo and encouraged people to live more intentionally, with an appreciation for the natural world and a commitment to their own personal freedom. His influence can be seen in a wide range of intellectual and cultural movements, from the civil rights movement to the modern sustainability movement. Though he passed away over 150 years ago, Thoreau's ideas and spirit continue to resonate with people around the world.</p><p>In addition to his work as a writer and activist, Thoreau was also a respected naturalist and scientist. He meticulously documented his observations of the plants, animals and ecosystems he encountered during his excursions into the wilderness, and his findings were published in scientific journals of the day. Thoreau's interest in the natural world was a central aspect of his philosophy, and he believed that the study of nature held valuable lessons for human society as well.</p><p>Thoreau's personal life was marked by a commitment to simplicity and self-sufficiency. He lived frugally, growing much of his own food and building his own cabin by the shores of Walden Pond. Thoreau's lifestyle reflected his belief in the importance of living deliberately, and he saw his time in nature as a way of reconnecting with the fundamental aspects of human existence.</p><p>Despite his influence and accomplishments, Thoreau remained a deeply private individual throughout his life. He never married and had few close friendships, preferring instead to focus on his work and his connection to the natural world. Thoreau's legacy as an important American thinker and cultural icon is a testament to the power of individual ideas and the enduring impact of those who dare to challenge conventional wisdom.</p><p></p><p>

(April 24, 1897		Winthrop-July 26, 1941			Hartford)


was
an American
anthropologist.


					
			
		He had
		three
		children,
		Raymond Ben Whorf, Robert Peckham Whorf and Celia Lee Whorf.

						</p><p>Whorf is best known for his study of linguistics and the relationship between language and culture. He proposed the theory of linguistic relativity, also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which suggests that the structure of the language we speak affects the way we think and perceive the world around us. Whorf spent much of his career studying the language and culture of the Hopi people, and he authored several papers and books on the subject. Whorf also worked as a fire prevention engineer for the Hartford Insurance Company, and it was through his work that he became interested in the connection between language and thought. Though he died unexpectedly at the age of 44, Whorf's ideas continue to influence linguistics and cultural anthropology today.</p><p>Whorf was born in Winthrop, Massachusetts, and grew up in a family of moderate means. He was a gifted student and went on to study chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). However, after several years in the field, he found that his true passion lay in the study of language and culture.</p><p>In addition to his linguistic and anthropological work, Whorf was deeply interested in the study of Native American culture and religion. He spent time with several tribes, including the Hopi and the Nahuatl people of Mexico, in order to gain a better understanding of their way of life.</p><p>After returning from his travels, Whorf took a job at the Hartford Insurance Company. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a respected fire prevention engineer. It was during his time at the insurance company that he began to explore the connection between language and thought in earnest.</p><p>Despite his relative lack of formal training in linguistics and anthropology, Whorf made a significant contribution to the field with his theory of linguistic relativity. His work helped to highlight the complex interplay between language, culture, and human cognition, and his ideas continue to be debated and analyzed to this day.</p><p>Whorf's theory of linguistic relativity proposed that the language a person speaks shapes their perception of the world around them. He believed that the structure of a language influences how an individual thinks, perceives, and understands reality. According to Whorf, language not only reflects but also shapes cultural differences, and it influences the way people behave and interact with the world.</p><p>In addition to his work on linguistic relativity, Whorf authored several papers and books on Hopi linguistics and culture. He studied their complex philosophical and religious beliefs, their social structure, and their language system. Whorf's work challenged the prevailing belief at the time that Native American languages were primitive and lacking in complexity.</p><p>Whorf's life was cut short when he died unexpectedly of cancer at the age of 44. Nevertheless, his work continues to influence not only linguistics and anthropology but also psychology and cognitive science. To this day, his theory of linguistic relativity remains a topic of debate and research. Whorf's legacy reminds us that language is not just a tool for communication but also a powerful force that shapes the way we think, perceive, and understand the world we live in.</p><p>Throughout his life, Whorf was also an accomplished writer and poet. He wrote several short stories and poems, some of which were published in literary journals such as Poetry and The Measure. He used his writing as a way to explore his own cultural identity and to express his fascination with language and culture. Whorf's writing often reflected his deep-seated belief that language and culture are inextricably linked, and that understanding one requires an understanding of the other.</p><p>Whorf's contributions to the field of linguistics were groundbreaking, but they were not without controversy. His theory of linguistic relativity was both praised and criticized, and it remains an area of active debate among linguists and anthropologists. However, it is largely agreed upon that Whorf's work helped to shift the focus of linguistics and anthropology away from a Eurocentric perspective and towards a more holistic understanding of human cognition and perception.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to anthropology and linguistics, the Linguistic Society of America established the Benjamin Lee Whorf Memorial Lecture, which is delivered annually at the society's meeting. The lecture serves as a tribute to Whorf's enduring legacy and is a testament to the continued importance of his work.</p><p></p><p>

(January 28, 1912		Cody-August 11, 1956			Springs)

	
		a.k.a. Paul Jackson Pollock or Jack the Dripper

	
was
an American
artist, visual artist and painter.


					</p><p>Pollock was a leading figure of the abstract expressionist movement, known for his unique style of drip painting. He began his career in the 1930s working as an artist under the Works Progress Administration, a program that provided economic relief to struggling artists during the Great Depression. </p><p>In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Pollock developed his signature style of dripping and splattering paint onto large canvases laid on the floor, which he called "action painting". His innovative technique propelled him to international fame and cemented his place in art history.</p><p>Despite struggling with alcoholism throughout his life, Pollock continued to create and produce art until his untimely death at the age of 44. His legacy lives on, as his works continue to inspire and influence contemporary artists today.</p><p>Pollock was born in Cody, Wyoming and grew up in Arizona and California. He moved to New York City in 1930 to study art, where he was exposed to many contemporary artists and art movements. Pollock's work was heavily influenced by Surrealism and the theories of psychologist Carl Jung. He married fellow artist Lee Krasner in 1945, who was a major contributor to his success.</p><p>Pollock's drip painting technique was a major departure from traditional methods of painting, and it provoked criticism and controversy in its early days. However, he eventually received recognition and acclaim for his work, including a 1949 feature in Life magazine, which dubbed him "Jack the Dripper." In addition to his paintings, Pollock also created prints, drawings and sculptures.</p><p>Pollock's work has been exhibited in major museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Tate Modern in London, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. In 1998, his painting "No. 5, 1948" sold for a record-breaking $140 million at auction. He remains one of the most significant and influential artists of the 20th century.</p><p>Pollock's groundbreaking artwork was not only visually stunning, but also represented a deep emotional and psychological expression. He believed that the act of painting was a way to release inner emotions and feelings, and his large, abstract works often contained chaotic and intense brushstrokes that conveyed a sense of raw energy and emotion.</p><p>Tragically, Pollock's personal struggles with alcoholism and psychological issues worsened as his fame grew. He struggled with depression and anxiety throughout his life, and his marriage to Krasner was often fraught with tension. Despite his struggles, Pollock continued to push the boundaries of his art, experimenting with new techniques and materials until his untimely death.</p><p>In addition to his impact on the art world, Pollock's life and work have been the subject of numerous films, books, and documentaries. He remains a cultural icon and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of artists.</p><p>Pollock's career spanned just over two decades, but in that time he created a significant body of work that had a lasting impact on the art world. In addition to his influence on the abstract expressionist movement, Pollock is frequently cited as a major precursor to the color field painting movement of the 1950s and 60s. His works continue to be analyzed and debated by art historians and critics, who see in his bold and unconventional approach to painting a reflection of larger social and cultural trends of his time.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Pollock's legacy has endured and his work remains popular with collectors and enthusiasts worldwide. In 2016, a major retrospective of his paintings was held at the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice, Italy, drawing crowds and critical acclaim. Today, Pollock is remembered not just as a groundbreaking artist, but also as a symbol of the energy and creativity of post-war America.</p><p></p><p>
