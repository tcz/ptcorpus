a Turkish
poet.


					</p><p>Along with his contemporaries, Oktay Rıfat and Melih Cevdet Anday, Orhan Veli Kanık is considered to be one of the founders of the Garip Movement in Turkish poetry. Garip, meaning ‘weird’ or ‘strange’ in Turkish, aimed to bring a new perspective to Turkish poetry by breaking away from traditional literary conventions and introducing a more colloquial and accessible style.</p><p>Orhan Veli Kanık’s most famous works include “Istanbul’u Dinliyorum” (“I’m Listening to Istanbul”), “Anlatamıyorum” (“I Can’t Explain”), and “Yürüyelim Arkadaşlar” (“Let’s Walk, Friends”). His poetry often focused on the mundane, everyday experiences of life, evoking a sense of familiarity with his readers while also highlighting the beauty and depth of seemingly ordinary moments.</p><p>Despite his short life, Orhan Veli Kanık made a lasting impact on Turkish literature, leaving behind a rich legacy of accessible poetry that continues to resonate with readers today.</p><p>Orhan Veli Kanık came from a middle-class family and grew up in various cities including Bursa and Ankara. He studied political science for a time at Ankara University but dropped out in his third year to pursue a career in literature. Orhan Veli Kanık’s early poetry was heavily influenced by the traditional Ottoman style of poetry, but he began to experiment with a more modern and accessible style in the mid-1940s. In addition to his poetry, Orhan Veli Kanık was also a prolific translator, bringing works by writers such as Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, and James Joyce into Turkish for the first time. He passed away at the age of 36 due to a heart attack while living in Istanbul. After his death, his friends and fellow poets compiled and published a posthumous collection of his poetry entitled “Orhan Veli Şiirleri” which continues to be widely read and celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>
