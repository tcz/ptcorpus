After the war, Glazar became a teacher and worked as an educator in Czechoslovakia. However, he was forced to leave his job due to communist persecution in the 1950s. In 1968, he emigrated to the United States, where he worked as a professor and continued to write.

Despite his tragic end, Glazar's work has had a lasting impact on Holocaust literature and serves as a powerful reminder of the horrors of the Nazi regime.</p><p>Throughout his lifetime, Richard Glazar was recognized for his contributions to Holocaust literature and education. In addition to "Trap with a Green Fence," he wrote two other books recounting his experiences during the war: "No Way Out" and "They Fought Back."

He continued to write and lecture on the Holocaust until his death. In recognition of his efforts to promote tolerance and understanding, Glazar was posthumously awarded the Charles Crane Memorial Prize for contributions to Holocaust education. </p><p>Despite his struggles with depression and traumatic memories of the war, Glazar is remembered as a courageous voice for the victims of the Holocaust. His legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of historical memory and education in preventing future atrocities.</p><p>Glazar's work has continued to have an impact on Holocaust scholarship and education even after his death. In 2018, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum hosted an exhibition titled "Richard Glazar's Prague: The Experience of a Survivor," which featured photographs and artifacts from Glazar's life, as well as excerpts from his writing. The exhibition sought to highlight the unique perspective that Glazar brought to Holocaust literature as a survivor who not only endured the horrors of the concentration camps but also witnessed the Nazi occupation of his hometown.
