						Alessandro Stradella is known as one of the most prominent composers of his time, particularly in the Baroque era of Italian music. He was born in Rome to a noble family, and began his music education at a young age. Stradella was known for his vocal compositions and operas, which often featured virtuosic arias and duets. He also worked as an impresario, managing productions of his own works and those of other composers. Despite his success, Stradella also had a turbulent personal life, which included numerous affairs and even a failed assassination attempt on his life. He eventually moved to Genoa, where he continued to compose and teach voice until he was tragically murdered at the age of 42. Despite his relatively short life, Alessandro Stradella's legacy has had a lasting impact on Baroque music, and his works continue to be performed and admired today.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=796545" title="Wikipedia article about Alessandro Stradella">Alessandro Stradella on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/mexican-actresses-died-in-2011.html' title='Mexican actresses died in 2011'><strong>Mexican actresses died in 2011</strong> List of the top 2 Mexican actresses who died in 2011</a></li><li><a href='/new-zealand-actors-died-at-age-79.html' title='New Zealand actors died at age 79'><strong>New Zealand actors died at age 79</strong> List of the top 1 New Zealand actors who died when they were 79</a></li><li><a href='/italian-actors-died-in-2012.html' title='Italian actors died in 2012'><strong>Italian actors died in 2012</strong> List of the top 8 Italian actors who died in 2012</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/italian-actors-died-at-age-67.html' title='Italian actors died at age 67'><strong>Italian actors died at age 67</strong> List of the top 22 Italian actors who died when they were 67</a></li><li><a href='/american-musicians-died-in-anorexia-nervosa.html' title='American musicians died in Anorexia nervosa'><strong>American musicians died in Anorexia nervosa</strong> List of the top 1 American music stars who died in Anorexia nervosa</a></li><li><a href='/cuban-musicians-died-at-age-22.html' title='Cuban musicians died at age 22'><strong>Cuban musicians died at age 22</strong> List of the top 1 Cuban music stars who died when they were 22</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
