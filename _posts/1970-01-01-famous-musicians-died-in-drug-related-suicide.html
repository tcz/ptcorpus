		a.k.a. Karin Maria Boye

	
was
a Swedish
writer, novelist and poet.


					</p><p>She grew up in a wealthy family and received a good education, studying in Stockholm and Uppsala. She was part of the Swedish literary society during the interwar period and was one of the few openly bisexual women in Sweden at the time. She is best known for her novel "Kallocain" which was published in 1940 and is considered one of the most important Swedish dystopian novels of the 20th century. Boye's writing was deeply influenced by her interest in philosophy and spirituality, and she was also a translator of German literature into Swedish. She suffered from depression throughout her life and tragically took her own life at the age of 40. Despite her relatively short lived career, she remains an iconic figure in Swedish literature and her work continues to be studied and admired today.</p><p>In addition to her literary career, Karin Boye was also politically active and involved in socialist and anti-fascist movements. She was a member of the Swedish Communist Party for a time, but later became disillusioned with communism and turned to pacifism. She was also interested in Theosophy, a spiritual movement that sought to unify all religions and promote spiritual evolution. Boye's work often reflects her political and spiritual beliefs, as well as her struggles with mental illness. Her poetry in particular is known for its lyrical quality and its exploration of themes such as death, love, and the human condition. Today, Boye is remembered not only as a talented writer, but also as a feminist, LGBT icon, and advocate for social justice.</p><p></p><p>
