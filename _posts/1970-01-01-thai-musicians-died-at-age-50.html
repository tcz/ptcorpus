a Thai
personality.


					</p><p>Naresuan was the King of the Ayutthaya Kingdom from 1590 until his death in 1605. He is considered one of the greatest kings in Thai history and is remembered for his bravery in defending his kingdom against the invading Burmese forces. Naresuan is also known for his close relationship with his elephant, which he rode into battle. During his reign, he established diplomatic relationships with several countries, including China and Japan. He is credited with introducing several reforms to the administration and military of the kingdom, which helped strengthen it. Today, he is still revered in Thailand as a symbol of courage and patriotism.</p><p>During his reign, Naresuan engaged in several battles against the Burmese forces, most notably the Battle of Nong Sarai, where he famously defeated and killed the Burmese Crown Prince Mingyi Swa. This battle is celebrated as a national holiday in Thailand. Naresuan was also known for promoting Thai culture and traditions, and in particular, for his patronage of Muay Thai (Thai boxing) which he personally practiced. He is also credited with commissioning several important temples and monuments, including the famous Victory Monument in Bangkok. Today, Naresuan is remembered as a patriotic and visionary leader who worked tirelessly to defend Thailand from foreign invasions, and who laid the foundations for a strong and prosperous kingdom.</p><p>Naresuan was born the third son of King Mahathammaracha I and Queen Wisutkasat in 1555. He was raised in the royal court in Phitsanulok and received education in various subjects, including Buddhism, history, astrology, and military tactics. At a young age, he was trained in the art of warfare and frequently accompanied his father on military campaigns. In 1569, when Naresuan was just 14 years old, he was taken captive by the Burmese army and held prisoner for several years. It was during this period that he honed his martial skills, and his experience in captivity intensified his hatred towards the Burmese.</p><p>In 1590, Naresuan ascended to the throne after his elder brother, King Maha Thammaracha IV, died of smallpox. As king, he reigned for 15 years and embarked on several military campaigns to defend the Ayutthaya Kingdom against Burmese invasions. He built a strong navy and established alliances with neighboring states, including the Lao and the Chinese. During his reign, he also oversaw the construction of several fortresses, including the Naresuan Fortress in Phitsanulok.</p><p>Naresuan was a patron of the arts, literature, and architecture. He supported the creation of several temples, including the Wat Phra Si Sanphet and the Wat Phra Sri Rattana Satsadaram. Under his reign, the Ayutthaya Kingdom experienced a cultural renaissance, with the arts flourishing and the local economy thriving.</p><p>Naresuan is also known for his close relationship with his elephant, which he affectionately called Phlai Ekachai. The king rode the elephant into battle against the Burmese and famously defeated the Burmese Crown Prince in a one-on-one duel atop elephants. This battle marked the end of Burmese domination over Ayutthaya and cemented Naresuan's reputation as a legendary king.</p><p>Overall, Naresuan's reign is remembered as a time of peace, prosperity, and cultural flourishing. His bravery in battle, diplomatic prowess, and cultural patronage have made him a celebrated figure in Thai history. Even today, many Thai people consider him a symbol of national pride and identity.</p><p></p><p>
