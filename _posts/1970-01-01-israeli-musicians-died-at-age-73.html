an Israeli
politician and military officer.

						</p><p>Rabin played an important role in forming and defending the State of Israel. After his military career, he served two terms as Prime Minister of Israel, the first from 1974 to 1977 and the second from 1992 until his assassination in 1995. One of his greatest achievements was signing the Oslo Accords in 1993, a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians which earned him the Nobel Peace Prize. Rabin's assassination shocked the world and led to a period of national mourning in Israel. His legacy, however, continues to inspire peace efforts in the region.</p><p>Rabin began his military career in the British Army during World War II and later joined the Haganah, the Jewish paramilitary organization in Palestine. He rose through the ranks and became the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces in 1964. Under his leadership, the IDF achieved a decisive victory in the 1967 Six-Day War against the surrounding Arab states.</p><p>As Prime Minister, Rabin pursued a policy of peace and reconciliation with Israel's Arab neighbors. He signed the peace treaty with Jordan in 1994 and made significant progress in negotiations with Syria. However, his efforts to reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians were met with opposition from some Israelis who believed that it would compromise Israel's security.</p><p>Rabin's assassination by a Jewish right-wing extremist at a peace rally in Tel Aviv sent shockwaves throughout Israel and the world. It marked a significant turning point in Israeli politics and sparked a renewed effort to find a lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors. Rabin's legacy lives on as a symbol of peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of assassination.
