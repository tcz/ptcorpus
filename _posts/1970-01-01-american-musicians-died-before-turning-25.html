(August 15, 1822		Baltimore-January 30, 1847			Fordham)

	
		otherwise known as Virginia Clemm, Virginia Poe or Virginia Eliza Clemm

	
was
an American
personality.


					</p><p>Virginia Clemm was the wife of famous American writer and poet, Edgar Allan Poe. The pair married when Virginia was just 13 years old and Edgar was 27. Despite the significant age difference, their marriage was said to be a happy one, and Virginia was known to be a great support to her husband's writing and career. She was also said to be a talented musician and artist in her own right. Virginia's death at the age of 24 devastated Poe, contributing to his own declining health and substance abuse issues.</p><p>After Virginia's death, Poe spiraled into a deep depression and struggled with alcoholism. Many believe that her death was the inspiration for some of Poe's most famous works, including "Annabel Lee" and "The Raven." Despite their short marriage and her early death, Virginia's impact on Poe's life and writing cannot be understated. She remains an important figure in American literature and the history of the Gothic genre. Today, a monument stands in her honor at the Poe Cottage in the Bronx, where she lived with Edgar in the final years of her life.</p><p>In addition to her musical and artistic talents, Virginia was also known for her beauty and intelligence. She had a close relationship with her mother, who also lived with her and Edgar in their later years. Virginia's relationship with Edgar was not without controversy, as they were first cousins and some suggested that their marriage was improper. Despite this, the couple stayed devoted to each other until Virginia's death.</p><p>After Virginia passed away, Poe wrote a moving tribute to her, saying, "In all this world there was no one like her. In beauty of character and intellect, in sweetness of disposition and gentleness of heart, she was unsurpassed." Poe never fully recovered from Virginia's death and continued to struggle with his own health and personal demons until his own untimely death just a few years later.</p><p>Despite their tragic story, Virginia and Edgar remain an enduring couple in American literature, and their love story continues to captivate readers today.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Virginia Clemm's relationship with Poe was not only controversial because they were first cousins, but also because of their age difference and the fact that she was underage when they married. Additionally, Virginia's early death is thought to have contributed to Poe's reputation as a tragic figure and cemented his place in literary history. In recent years, there has been increased attention given to Virginia's own talent and creativity, with some scholars suggesting that she may have even contributed to some of her husband's writing. Despite her short life and tragic end, Virginia Clemm Poe's impact on American literature and culture is still felt today.</p><p></p><p>

(October 18, 1939		New Orleans-November 24, 1963			Dallas)

	
		also known as A.J. Hidell, Alek Oswald, Lee Oswald, O. H. Lee or Harvey Oswald

	
was
an American
personality.


					
			
		His children
		are
		called
		June Lee Oswald and Audrey Marina Rachel Oswald.

						</p><p>Lee Harvey Oswald is famously known for his involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He was a former US Marine who defected to the Soviet Union and later returned to the United States. Oswald worked at the Texas School Book Depository from where he allegedly fired shots at the presidential motorcade. He was arrested for the assassination and brought to trial but was killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby before he could be convicted. The assassination remains controversial and subject to various conspiracy theories.</p><p>Lee Harvey Oswald was born in New Orleans to a working-class family. His father died two months before he was born, and his mother struggled to support Oswald and his siblings. Oswald had a troubled childhood and dropped out of school at the age of 16. He joined the US Marines in 1956 and was stationed in Japan, where he became interested in communism.</p><p>In 1959, Oswald traveled to Moscow and defected to the Soviet Union, where he worked in a factory and married a Russian woman named Marina Prusakova. He spent two and a half years in the Soviet Union before returning to the United States in 1962 with his wife and infant daughter.</p><p>Oswald had difficulty finding work and became increasingly disillusioned with the US government. He also became involved with political groups and attended rallies and meetings, including ones held by the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.</p><p>On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Oswald was apprehended in a nearby theater and charged with the murder. He maintained his innocence but was killed two days later by Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner with alleged connections to organized crime.</p><p>The assassination of President Kennedy remains one of the most controversial events in American history, and many conspiracy theories have been proposed. Despite extensive investigations and inquiries, no conclusive evidence has ever been found to prove that Oswald acted alone or that there was a larger conspiracy to assassinate the president.</p><p>Oswald's assassination of JFK and subsequent killing by Ruby led to numerous investigations, including the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The theories surrounding the assassination range from Oswald acting alone, to involvement by the CIA, organized crime, or the government of Cuba.</p><p>Aside from his involvement in the assassination, Oswald's life has been the subject of interest and scrutiny. Some have speculated that his time in the Soviet Union was a formative period in his life, while others point to his troubled childhood as a contributing factor to his actions later in life.</p><p>In addition to his wife Marina and children, Oswald left behind a trail of writings, including a personal diary and letters to various individuals and organizations. These writings have been studied by historians and researchers to gain insight into Oswald's beliefs and motivations.</p><p>Overall, Lee Harvey Oswald remains a controversial and enigmatic figure in American history, whose actions on November 22, 1963 have left a lasting impact on the country and its politics.</p><p>Despite his well-known actions and the controversial circumstances of his life and death, Lee Harvey Oswald remains a somewhat enigmatic figure. He was a complex individual whose beliefs and motivations continue to be debated and examined by historians, scholars, and the public alike.</p><p>Oswald's brief defection to the Soviet Union and his interest in communism have led some to speculate that he was a committed Marxist who sought to overthrow the US government. Others point to his troubled childhood, his difficulties adjusting to civilian life after leaving the Marines, and his marginalized status in society as key factors in his actions.</p><p>Despite the ongoing debate about Oswald's motives, the lasting impact of his actions can be felt to this day. The assassination of President Kennedy remains one of the defining moments in modern American history, and the conspiracy theories surrounding the event continue to fascinate and intrigue people around the world.</p><p>In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Oswald and his legacy, with new information and insights coming to light through the release of previously classified government documents and other sources. As the investigation into the assassination continues, the story of Lee Harvey Oswald remains one of the most compelling and enduring mysteries of our time.</p><p></p><p>
