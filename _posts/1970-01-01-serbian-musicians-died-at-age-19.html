He began skiing at a young age and showed early promise in the sport, joining a skiing club when he was just six years old.

The organization quickly gained widespread support, and Garibovic became widely known in his homeland for his philanthropic work.</p><p>Tragically, Garibovic's life was cut short on his 19th birthday when he was involved in a car accident. His passing was a great loss to the skiing world and to the people he had touched through his charitable work. However, his legacy lives on, both through the Amar Garibović Memorial Ski Marathon and through the ongoing work of the "Help for Life" organization. Garibovic's example serves as an inspiration to others, a reminder that even a short life can be deeply meaningful if it is lived with passion and purpose.</p><p>Despite his brief career in skiing, Amar Garibovic made a significant impact on the sport and the people he touched through his philanthropic work.
