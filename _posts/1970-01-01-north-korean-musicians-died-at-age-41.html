was
a North Korean

		He had
		one

						</p><p>Kim Hyong-jik was one of the early leaders of the Korean independence movement against Japanese colonial rule. He founded the Korean Children's Union and the Anti-Imperialist Youth League. He was a strong advocate for the rights of peasants and workers, and was an important figure in the formation of the Korean Communist Party. Despite his early death at the age of 41, his legacy lived on through his son, Kim Il-sung, who went on to become the first leader of North Korea. Today, Kim Hyong-jik is respected as a patriot and revolutionary in North Korea.</p><p>Kim Hyong-jik was born in Mangyongdae, a small village near Pyongyang. He was the son of a Confucian scholar and grew up in a traditional Korean household. Despite his father's wishes for him to become a scholar like him, Kim Hyong-jik decided to pursue politics instead. He joined the Korean independence movement at a young age and became a prominent leader, advocating for radical change in Korean society.</p><p>In addition to his political activism, Kim Hyong-jik was a teacher and worked to establish a system of education for Korea's working-class children. He believed that education was key to empowering the masses and worked tirelessly to ensure that all Koreans had access to education.</p><p>Kim Hyong-jik's son, Kim Il-sung, went on to become one of North Korea's most famous and controversial political figures. He led the country for decades until his death in 1994. Despite his legacy being complicated, North Koreans still honor him as the country's founder and a revolutionary hero.</p><p>Today, Kim Hyong-jik's legacy lives on in North Korea as a symbol of the country's struggle for independence and the importance of education and social progress. His grandson, Kim Jong-un, currently serves as North Korea's leader.</p><p>After his marriage to Kang Ban Sok, Kim Hyong-jik traveled to Manchuria to participate in the Korean independence movement. He was jailed multiple times for his actions, and his health declined as a result of the harsh conditions he experienced in prison. Despite this, he remained dedicated to his cause and continued to fight for Korean sovereignty until his death. In addition to his political activities, Kim Hyong-jik was a prolific writer and poet. His works frequently dealt with themes of independence, freedom, and social justice, and he remains a respected literary figure in North Korea to this day. His words and ideas continue to inspire the North Korean people to pursue their own path towards self-determination and a better future.</p><p>Kim Hyong-jik's dedication and commitment to Korean sovereignty and social justice have left a lasting impact on North Korean society. His activism on behalf of the working class and his advocacy for education helped to lay the groundwork for North Korea's socialist system, which places a strong emphasis on education and public welfare. His vision of a free and equal society still resonates with many North Koreans, who continue to seek social and economic justice under the country's current leadership.</p><p>However, Kim Hyong-jik's legacy remains controversial outside of North Korea, with some critics accusing him of being a Communist revolutionary and promoting a radical ideology. Despite this, his influence on North Korean society and politics cannot be denied, as his son and grandson have continued to shape the country's political and social landscape in his image. Today, Kim Hyong-jik is remembered as a patriot and a revolutionary hero, whose legacy continues to inspire and guide the North Korean people.</p><p></p><p>

(November 13, 1908		Pyongyang-October 6, 1950)


was
a North Korean
entomologist.


					</p><p>Seok Joo-myung was born in Pyongyang, which was then part of the Korean Empire. He went on to study entomology at Kyoto Imperial University in Japan, where he earned his PhD in 1939. Upon returning to North Korea, he became a professor at what is now known as Kim Il-sung University. Seok was considered an expert in the field of entomology and published several books and articles throughout his career.</p><p>Tragically, Seok Joo-myungâ€™s life was cut short during the Korean War. In 1950, he was captured by South Korean soldiers while on a research expedition and was accused of being a communist sympathizer. He was executed by a gunshot wound shortly after being captured. Seok is remembered as a dedicated scientist and educator, who devoted his life to studying and preserving the natural world.</p><p>Seok Joo-myung's contributions to entomology have been recognized posthumously. In 1953, the North Korean government established the Seok Joo-myung Scientific Research Institute in his honor. The institute focuses on research in agriculture, biology, and chemistry. Additionally, Seok was awarded the Order of Kim Il-sung for his contributions to science and education. He is also remembered as a symbol of North Korean resistance against what was perceived as unjust aggression from the South. In recent years, Seok Joo-myung's story has been dramatized in North Korean films and television shows, further cementing his legacy as a martyr for the cause of North Korea.</p><p>Seok Joo-myung's legacy continues to be studied and discussed by scholars and historians. Many view his execution as a symbol of the deep political divisions that existed in Korea during the early 1950s. His story also highlights the destructive impact of war on scientific research and progress.</p><p>Beyond his contributions to the field of entomology, Seok Joo-myung is remembered as a passionate advocate for social justice and a strong supporter of North Korean independence. He was an active member of the Korean People's Army and was deeply committed to the revolutionary ideals of communist ideology.</p><p>Overall, Seok Joo-myung's life and work serve as an important reminder of the power of scientific inquiry and the enduring nature of personal conviction. Despite his tragic end, Seok's legacy continues to inspire generations of North Korean scientists and thinkers, who seek to build on his legacy of scientific excellence and social justice.</p><p>Seok Joo-myung's death during the Korean War left behind a wife and young daughter, who were also captured and held as political prisoners by South Korean forces. However, they were eventually released and it is believed that Seok's wife went on to work at the Seok Joo-myung Scientific Research Institute established in his honor. Seok's legacy has also been commemorated through the publication of a collection of his insect specimens, which are now held by the National Academy of Agricultural Science in North Korea. Additionally, a bronze bust of Seok Joo-myung was erected in the city of Pyongyang in the 1970s, further cementing his role as a symbol of scientific and national pride in North Korea.</p><p></p><p>
