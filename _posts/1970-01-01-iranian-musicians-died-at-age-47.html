(September 5, 1933		Kerman-August 30, 1981			Tehran)


was
an Iranian
politician.


					</p><p>Bahonar was the Prime Minister of Iran for a brief period of time in 1981 before his tragic death. He was a close confidant of the then-Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, and played a key role in the Islamic Revolution that overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979. Prior to his appointment as Prime Minister, Bahonar served as the Minister of Education and the Deputy Prime Minister of Iran. He was a prominent figure in the Islamic Republic Party, which was the ruling party of Iran at the time of his death. The circumstances surrounding Bahonar's assassination remain controversial to this day.</p><p>Bahonar was born in the city of Kerman in southeastern Iran. He received his early education in Kerman before moving to Tehran to continue his studies. He obtained his degree in mechanical engineering from Tehran University in 1958. After graduation, Bahonar joined the faculty of Kerman Industrial Institute as a professor. He later served as the director of the Institute.</p><p>Bahonar was an active participant in the anti-Shah protests that swept the country in the late 1970s. He was a prominent member of the Islamic Republican Party, which emerged as a major political force after the fall of the Shah. In 1979, he was appointed as the Minister of Education in the interim government that was formed after the revolution.</p><p>As the Prime Minister of Iran, Bahonar had ambitious plans to steer the country toward economic and social prosperity. However, his premiership was cut short when he and the President of Iran, Mohammad-Ali Rajai, were assassinated by a bomb on August 30, 1981. The perpetrators of the attack were members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq, an Iranian opposition group.</p><p>Bahonar's legacy is remembered as a key figure in the Islamic Revolution and an advocate for advancing education in Iran. He is also recognized for his role in building the foundations of the Islamic Republic of Iran after the fall of the Pahlavi dynasty. Bahonar's tragic death, along with Rajai's, was a major blow to the Iranian government and destabilized the country's political landscape.</p><p></p><p>
