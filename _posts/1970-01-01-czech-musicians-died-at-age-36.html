						</p><p>Lev Blatný was best known for his poetry and prose, which often dealt with themes of love, loss, and the human experience. He was also a translator, translating works from English, French and Polish into Czech. Additionally, he was a member of the avant-garde group of poets known as Devětsil, which was part of the broader Czech artistic movement of the 1920s and 1930s. Despite his contributions to Czech literature, Blatný's life was cut tragically short when he died by suicide at the age of 36.</p><p>Blatný was born in Brno, then part of Austria-Hungary, and grew up in a Jewish family. He received a degree in law from the Charles University in Prague, but turned to writing and journalism after graduation. In addition to his poetry and prose, Blatný wrote articles and essays for various newspapers and magazines.</p><p>Blatný's first collection of poetry, "Dvě básně" (Two Poems), was published in 1915. He went on to publish several more collections, including "Naděje" (Hope) and "Poutník" (The Pilgrim). His works were admired for their lyrical quality and emotional depth.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Blatný was an active member of the Czech cultural scene. He was involved in the Prague literary café scene and was a regular at the famed Café Arco. He also traveled extensively throughout Europe, and lived in Paris for a time in the late 1920s, where he associated with members of the Surrealist movement.</p><p>Blatný's son Ivan would later become a renowned poet in his own right. After Lev Blatný's death, Ivan and his mother fled Czechoslovakia and settled in England. Ivan continued to write and publish in English, becoming known for his work on themes of exile and displacement.</p><p></p><p>
