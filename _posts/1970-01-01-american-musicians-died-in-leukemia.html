									</h1><p>Here are 50 famous musicians from United States of America died in Leukemia:</p><h2>Spiro Agnew</h2><p><strong>Spiro Agnew</strong>
(November 9, 1918		Towson-September 17, 1996			Berlin)

	
		a.k.a. Vice President Spiro Agnew, Spiro Theodore Agnew or Ted

	
was
an American
lawyer and politician.


					
			
		He had
		four
		children,
		Pamela Lee Agnew, James Rand Agnew, Susan Scott Agnew and Elinor Kimberly Agnew.

						</p><p>Agnew served as the 39th Vice President of the United States from 1969 to 1973, under President Richard Nixon. Prior to his role as Vice President, Agnew served as the Governor of Maryland from 1967 to 1969. During his tenure as Vice President, Agnew was known for his vocal criticisms of the media, Democrats, and anti-Vietnam War protesters. However, he ultimately resigned from his position in 1973 after being charged with accepting bribes and tax evasion. After leaving office, Agnew worked as a business consultant and maintained a low public profile until his death in 1996.</p><p>Agnew was born to Greek immigrant parents and grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Johns Hopkins University, where he earned his Bachelor's degree in Political Science, and later went on to study law at the University of Baltimore School of Law. After his graduation, he practiced law in Baltimore and became involved in local politics.</p><p>His rise in politics began in 1962 when he was elected as the Baltimore County Executive, where he served for five years before being elected as the Governor of Maryland in 1966. During his tenure as Governor, he advocated for educational reform and modernizing the state's transportation system.</p><p>Agnew's time as Vice President was largely defined by his controversial speeches, in which he attacked the media for their coverage of the Nixon administration and criticized anti-war protestors. However, his political career came to an abrupt end when he was investigated for corruption and pleaded no contest to the charges of tax evasion and bribery.</p><p>Despite the scandal, Agnew remained unrepentant in his later years and maintained that he was a victim of a political witch hunt. He also authored several books, including his memoir, "Go Quietly...Or Else," in which he defended his tenure as Vice President and his decision to resign.</p><p>Agnew's legacy remains deeply polarizing, with some viewing him as a victim of political persecution and others condemning him as a corrupt politician. However, his impact on American politics is undeniable, as his aggressive attacks on the media foreshadowed the ongoing debate over the role of the press in the government.</p><p></p><p>
