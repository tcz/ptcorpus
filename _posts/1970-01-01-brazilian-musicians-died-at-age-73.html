He was also known for his experimentation with narrative structure and visual language. Some of his most famous works include "Eros, the God of Love" (1981), "The Vampires of Copacabana" (1976), and "Kisses and Caroms" (1963). Khouri also received international recognition for his work, winning awards at film festivals in Cannes, Venice, and Locarno. He was also a member of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1983. Outside of filmmaking, Khouri was a writer, painter, and photographer.</p><p>Khouri was a self-taught filmmaker who began his career in the late 1940s as an editor and sound engineer. He later went on to direct his first film, "Chao de Estrelas," in 1952, but it was his second film, "Asfalto Selvagem," released in 1964, which gained him international recognition. Throughout his career, Khouri worked with some of the most accomplished Brazilian actors and actresses, including Norma Bengell, Odete Lara, and Grande Otelo. His films often explored taboo subjects such as extramarital affairs and homosexuality, which caused controversy in conservative Brazil during the 1960s and 1970s.

Khouri's portrayal of women paved the way for a new generation of female filmmakers in Brazil.</p><p>Despite his success, Khouri faced financial and artistic challenges throughout his career. He often struggled to secure funding for his films, and his avant-garde style was not always well-received by audiences or critics. However, Khouri remained dedicated to his art and continued to push the boundaries of Brazilian cinema until his death in 2003.</p><p>Today, Khouri is remembered as a trailblazer in Brazilian cinema and a champion of artistic freedom. His films are celebrated for their boldness, innovation, and unflinching exploration of taboo topics. Khouri's legacy continues to inspire filmmakers and audiences alike, both in Brazil and around the world.</p><p></p><p>
