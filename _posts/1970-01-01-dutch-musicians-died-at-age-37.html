(January 1, 1657		Niedorp-April 5, 1694			Amsterdam)


was
a Dutch
writer.


					</p><p>She was the daughter of a Dutch Reformed minister and grew up in the town of Niedorp, near Alkmaar. She received a good education and was able to read and write in several languages. She wrote several works, including poetry, essays, and translations. Her most famous work is "The Wise Virgin," which is a collection of moral stories for children. </p><p>Van der Woude was a member of the Dutch Republic's intellectual elite and was known for her outspoken opinions on social and political issues of the day. She was a supporter of the Enlightenment, which emphasized reason and science over traditional views and beliefs. </p><p>Despite her contributions to Dutch literature, van der Woude's works were largely forgotten in the centuries following her death. It wasn't until the 20th century that her writing was rediscovered and she was recognized as an important figure in Dutch literary history.</p><p>In addition to her literary pursuits, Elizabeth van der Woude was also a strong advocate for women's education and equal rights. She believed that women should have access to the same education and opportunities as men and was vocal about the importance of women's voices being heard in society. This was a radical position at the time, and van der Woude often faced criticism and ridicule for her beliefs.

Despite her untimely death at the age of 37, Elizabeth van der Woude's legacy lives on as an early feminist and literary pioneer in Dutch history.</p><p>Furthermore, Elizabeth van der Woude's writing style and subject matter were ahead of her time. She wrote about issues such as poverty, religious intolerance, and gender inequality, topics that were not commonly addressed by writers of her era. Her work was often critical of the Dutch Reformed Church and its treatment of women, which brought her both praise and criticism from fellow intellectuals. Van der Woude's ability to incorporate her personal experiences and ideas into her writing made her work relatable and accessible to a wide audience, which contributed to her growing popularity in the Dutch literary world.</p><p>In addition to her literary and feminist pursuits, Elizabeth van der Woude was also a devoted mother and wife. She married Johannes van Breen, a wealthy merchant, in 1686, and together they had three children. Despite her family obligations, van der Woude remained committed to her writing and activism, often finding ways to combine the two. She organized literary salons in her home and corresponded with other writers and intellectuals across Europe, establishing herself as a prominent figure in the Dutch cultural scene.</p><p>Overall, Elizabeth van der Woude's life and work demonstrate the power of literature to challenge societal norms and promote social change. Despite the obstacles she faced as a woman in a male-dominated society, she remained dedicated to her beliefs and succeeded in leaving a lasting impact on Dutch culture and history.</p><p></p><p>

(October 10, 1902		Den Helder-September 15, 1940			Bennekom)


was
a Dutch
personality.


					</p><p>Dick Ket was a Dutch painter and a prominent figure of the Nieuwe Haagse School ("New Hague School") movement. He was known for his unique style, which blended elements of Cubism, Surrealism, and Neue Sachlichkeit. Ket's art often featured still lifes, portraits, and landscapes, with a focus on precise and realistic details. Despite his short life, Ket was a highly regarded artist in his time and a source of inspiration for many young painters. Unfortunately, Ket's promising career was cut short when he took his own life at the age of 37, just before the outbreak of World War II. Today, his legacy lives on, and his artwork can be found in various collections around the world.</p><p>Ket was born in Den Helder, Netherlands, in 1902. At a young age, he showed great artistic talent and was encouraged by his parents to pursue his passion for art. Ket began his formal training at the age of 16, studying at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague under the guidance of prominent Dutch artists such as Willem de Zwart and Johannes Bosboom.</p><p>During the 1920s and 1930s, Ket gained recognition for his artwork, exhibiting in various galleries and museums throughout the Netherlands. He was a member of the influential Pulchri Studio, a collective of Dutch artists who were at the forefront of the Nieuwe Haagse School movement.</p><p>Ket's artwork was characterized by his precise and realistic style, which was influenced by the works of artists such as Jan van Eyck and Johannes Vermeer. He was also inspired by the works of modern artists such as Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, incorporating elements of Cubism and Surrealism into his paintings.</p><p>Despite his success as an artist, Ket struggled with personal issues throughout his life. He suffered from depression and anxiety and was known to be a heavy drinker. In September 1940, just weeks before the German occupation of the Netherlands, Ket took his own life in his studio in Bennekom.</p><p>Today, Ket is remembered as one of the most important artists of the Nieuwe Haagse School movement. His artwork continues to inspire generations of painters around the world.</p><p>Ket's legacy is particularly significant as he was one of the few artists who managed to bridge the gap between traditional and modern art, often incorporating elements of both in his paintings. Despite his relatively short career, Ket produced a significant body of work, including over 100 oil paintings, which are celebrated for their intricate detail, vibrant colors, and unique composition. Some of Ket's most famous works include "The Gourd" (1928), "Still Life with Mirror" (1931), and "The House with the Red Roof" (1936). </p><p>Since his death, Ket has been the subject of numerous retrospectives, including a major exhibition at the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague in 1999. His paintings continue to be highly sought after by collectors and art enthusiasts, with some fetching tens of thousands of dollars at auction. The legacy of Dick Ket remains an enduring reminder of the importance of art, both in its ability to inspire and to capture the human experience.</p><p></p><p>
