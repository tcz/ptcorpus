						</p><p>Stephen Wilkinson (April 29, 1919 Cambridgeshire-) is an English physicist, who made significant contributions in the field of nuclear physics. He studied at the University of Cambridge where he earned his Bachelor's degree in Natural Sciences and his Ph.D. in 1948. During his career, he worked at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell and later at the University of Birmingham, where he was appointed as a professor of experimental physics in 1956.</p><p>Wilkinson's notable achievements include his work on nuclear fission, particularly his co-discovery of the element astatine. He also made important contributions to the understanding of the nuclear structure of unstable isotopes. Throughout his career, Wilkinson was awarded many honors and distinctions, including being elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1963 and receiving the prestigious Hughes Medal in 1970.</p><p>Aside from his research, Wilkinson was also an advocate for science education and wrote several popular science books, aimed at making physics accessible to the general public.</p><p>Furthermore, during World War II, Wilkinson worked on the development of radar and later contributed to the Manhattan Project. Later in his career, he was appointed as the Director of the Nuclear Physics Laboratory at the University of Oxford. Wilkinson also served as the President of the Institute of Physics from 1974 to 1976. In addition to his scientific contributions, Wilkinson was also an accomplished musician and played the piano and the organ. He continued to be active in both the scientific and musical communities until his death at the age of 94 in 2013. Today, Wilkinson is recognized as one of the pioneering figures in the field of nuclear physics and his work continues to influence researchers in the field.</p><p>Wilkinson's work on nuclear fission was vital for the development of nuclear power and the atomic bomb. His co-discovery of astatine, along with Dale R. Corson and Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, added to our understanding of the periodic table and the behavior of radioactive elements. Wilkinson's research on the nuclear structure of isotopes was fundamental in the development of modern nuclear physics. He pioneered the use of gamma-ray spectroscopy to study the properties of radioactive nuclei.
 
In addition to his scientific and musical pursuits, Wilkinson was also involved in various administrative and advisory roles. He served on numerous committees, including the Council of the Science Research Council, the Advisory Council of the British National Nuclear Corporation, and the Advisory Board of the University of Surrey. Wilkinson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1973 and was promoted to Knight Commander in 1987 for his contributions to science and public service. </p><p>Despite facing discrimination as a Jewish scientist, Wilkinson persisted in pursuing his passion for physics and made significant contributions to the field. He set an example for generations of researchers to come, demonstrating the importance of scientific curiosity, perseverance, and courage.</p><p>In addition to his extraordinary career in physics, Stephen Wilkinson had also experienced discrimination as a Jewish physicist. Being recognized for his outstanding achievements, he played a significant role as a pioneer and a leader for Jewish physicists in the UK. During his time as the President of the Institute of Physics, he actively worked towards reducing discrimination and bias in science, advocating for cultural diversity in the research community. He was a strong believer in the importance of science education for the public and was committed to making physics accessible to all. Wilkinson's legacy continues to inspire young scientists to pursue their passions and strive for excellence in their field, while also dedicating themselves to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in science.</p><p>Wilkinson's contribution to the field of nuclear physics also included his work on the development of bubble chambers, a device used to detect and capture the tracks of subatomic particles. He applied this technology to study the properties of cosmic rays and helped to advance our understanding of their nature and behavior.</p><p>Outside of his professional pursuits, Wilkinson was deeply committed to his family and to his Jewish faith. He was an active member of his local synagogue and was involved in various Jewish organizations throughout his life. He was a devoted husband to his wife, Lili, and a loving father and grandfather.</p><p>Wilkinson's impact on the field of physics and on society as a whole was significant and lasting. He paved the way for further breakthroughs in nuclear physics and inspired future generations of scientists to pursue their dreams and ambitions. His advocacy for science education and cultural diversity in science continues to be an important reminder of the important role that science and technology can play in creating a more equitable and just society.</p><p></p><p>
