He saw the war as an opportunity to put his Planisme ideas into practice on a larger scale. After the war, he was arrested by the Allies and held in custody in Switzerland, where he wrote a controversial book, "Au-Dela du Marxisme" ("Beyond Marxism"), which attempted to reconcile his wartime collaboration with his earlier socialist beliefs. </p><p>De Man was eventually convicted of treason in absentia by the Belgian government in 1945, and he was unable to return to Belgium for the rest of his life. He died in 1953 in Greng, Switzerland. Despite his controversial legacy, De Man's legacy as a Marxist theorist and his contributions to the Belgian Socialist Party are still remembered today.</p><p></p><p>
