(April 26, 1765		Neston-January 15, 1815			Calais)

	
		also known as Lady Emma Hamilton or Emma Hart

	
was
a British
singer.


					
			
		Her child
		is
		called
		Horatia Nelson.

						</p><p>While Emma Hamilton was indeed known for her singing, she is perhaps best remembered for her scandalous personal life and her relationship with British naval hero Horatio Nelson. Emma was first employed as a maid before becoming the mistress of the wealthy Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh. She later became a celebrated model and muse for English painter George Romney. Through her association with Romney, Emma met Nelson and the two began a passionate love affair that scandalized society. Although they were both married, their relationship lasted until Nelson's death at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Emma's reputation was further tarnished by financial troubles and her eventual imprisonment for debt. Despite these difficulties, she left a lasting legacy as a fashion icon and as the inspiration for many artistic works.</p><p>Emma Hamilton was born Amy Lyon in Cheshire, England, and was the daughter of a blacksmith. At the age of 12, she began working as a domestic servant in London. Her singing talent was discovered by Charles Greville, who helped her launch a career as a performer. Emma gained popularity as a performer of "attitudes", a kind of performance art in which she posed in classical costumes and mimed scenes from mythology and literature.</p><p>Emma's relationship with Nelson began in 1798 when she was still married to Sir William Hamilton, the British ambassador to Naples. Nelson had been sent to Naples to help the royal family during the French Revolutionary Wars. Emma and Nelson's love affair scandalized society, and Emma was widely criticized for her supposed immorality. However, Nelson's heroism and tragic death in battle made him a national hero, and Emma was eventually forgiven for her indiscretions.</p><p>After Nelson's death, Emma fell into debt and was imprisoned. She then moved to Calais, where she died in poverty in 1815. Emma's life has been the subject of numerous books, plays, and films, and her image has been immortalized in countless works of art.</p><p></p><p>

Lawford produced several films throughout his career, including "Salt and Pepper" and "The April Fools." In addition to his successful acting and producing career, Lawford was also known for his high-profile relationships, including a marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President John F. Kennedy. Lawford was a heavy drinker and struggled with addiction throughout his life. He died in 1984 due to liver and kidney failure at the age of 61.</p><p>Despite his successful acting and producing career, Lawford faced several personal and legal issues later in life. He was expelled from the Rat Pack in 1963 due to his excessive drinking and drug abuse, which led to the decline of his career in Hollywood. In 1975, Lawford was charged with statutory rape of a minor, but the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. He later wrote a book titled "The Peter Lawford Story," in which he discussed his struggles with addiction and personal relationships with famous individuals, including Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland. Lawford's life was also rumored to be the basis for the character of Nick Charles in the film "The Thin Man."
