(October 10, 1895		Bartoszówek-July 12, 1945			Bad Ischl)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen was a high-ranking officer in the German Air Force, also known as the Luftwaffe, during World War II. He is regarded as one of the most skilled and aggressive Luftwaffe commanders, having played a critical role in several major battles and campaigns throughout the war.</p><p>Richthofen initially served in the German Army during World War I, but later transitioned to the Luftwaffe in the 1930s. He played a key role in the German invasion of Poland in 1939 and later commanded the Luftwaffe forces in the Battle of Britain in 1940. Richthofen went on to lead various bombing and ground support missions, including Operation Barbarossa in the Soviet Union and the North African campaign.</p><p>Despite his military successes, he was known for being a controversial figure, with some accusing him of war crimes for his involvement in the bombing of civilian areas. After the war, Richthofen was captured by Allied forces and was tried and sentenced to death at the Nuremberg Trials for his role in the war. However, he died before the sentence could be carried out, succumbing to a brain tumor in 1945.</p><p>Richthofen was born in the small town of Bartoszówek, which was then part of East Prussia in Germany. He came from a prominent military family, with several of his ancestors having served as generals in the Prussian Army.Richthofen's interest in aviation began during World War I, where he served as an artillery officer on the Western Front. After the war, he joined the civilian aviation industry and later, the newly formed Luftwaffe in the 1930s. </p><p>As a commander in the Luftwaffe, Richthofen was known for his innovative tactics, such as using dive-bombing techniques and close air support. He was also a skilled pilot himself, having flown over 500 combat missions during the war. </p><p>Despite his controversial reputation, Richthofen was highly respected by his fellow pilots and was awarded numerous military honors, including the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords, one of the highest awards in the German military at the time. </p><p>After his death, his legacy was somewhat overshadowed by his association with the Nazi regime and his involvement in war crimes. However, today he is still recognized as one of the most skilled and influential military commanders of his time.</p><p>During his time as commander of the Luftwaffe forces in North Africa, Richthofen was known for his brutal tactics, particularly in the bombing of civilian areas in Egypt. He also ordered the execution of several British prisoners of war, which further contributed to his controversial reputation. Despite this, he was praised by Adolf Hitler and other high-ranking officials in the Nazi regime.Richthofen's death at the age of 49 was a shock to many, especially considering his young age and his role in the war. Some have speculated that his brain tumor may have been caused by exposure to toxic chemicals used in the German military's chemical warfare program. Regardless of the cause, Richthofen's death marked the end of a tumultuous and controversial career, one that continues to be studied and debated by military historians and scholars today.</p><p></p><p>

The two met during the production of the film "Congress Dances" in 1931 and remained friends for many years. Hartjenstein's relationship with Harvey has been the subject of historical debate, with some suggesting that it may have influenced his views on the Nazi Party and their anti-Semitic policies. </p><p>Hartjenstein's legacy remains controversial, with some viewing him as a talented filmmaker who was forced to work for the Nazi regime, while others see him as a willing participant in Nazi propaganda. His work continues to be studied by film scholars and historians for its historical significance and the role it played in promoting Nazi ideology.</p><p></p><p>

In addition to his work with optics, Lippershey also made globes and other scientific instruments. He was highly regarded in his time and received several honors from royalty, including a commission to make lenses for the Prince of Orange. Lippershey died in 1619 in Middelburg, Netherlands, where he had relocated to continue his work as an optician.</p><p>Lippershey began his career as a spectacle maker in Amsterdam, but eventually moved to Middleburg where he worked as an optician and telescope maker. He applied for a patent for the telescope in 1608, but was unsuccessful, as two other men also claimed to have invented the device. Despite this setback, Lippershey continued to be a renowned figure in the fields of optics and astronomy throughout his life. In addition to his scientific work, Lippershey was also involved in his community, serving as a member of the local government and as a deacon in his church. His legacy lives on in the countless telescopes and other optical instruments that have been developed over the centuries, all based on his original design.</p><p>It is believed that Lippershey was inspired to invent the telescope after hearing about the recent discoveries of the moons of Jupiter by Galileo. Although his original design was simple and had low magnification, it revolutionized the field of astronomy by allowing for a closer and more detailed examination of the night sky. It is said that Lippershey's telescopes could magnify objects by up to three times, which allowed him to observe celestial bodies that were previously invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>Despite his contributions to science, Lippershey died in relative obscurity, and it wasn't until many years later that his role in the invention of the telescope was fully recognized. Today, he is remembered as one of the pioneering figures in the field of optics, and his legacy highlights the importance of curiosity and invention in scientific progress.</p><p></p><p>

(November 12, 1863		Grudziądz-April 28, 1913)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Franz Boluminski was a German painter and graphic artist. He was born on November 12, 1863, in Grudziądz, which at the time was part of Prussia. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich and later worked as a teacher at the School of Arts and Crafts in Bremen. Boluminski's work was mainly influenced by the German Romanticism and Symbolism movements. He painted landscapes, portraits, and genre scenes and was particularly known for his depictions of rural life. Boluminski also created posters and book illustrations. He passed away on April 28, 1913, at the age of 49. Today, his works can be found in various museums and galleries across Germany.</p><p>Boluminski was a member of the Association of Artists in Bremen and participated in many local and national exhibitions during his lifetime. His art was praised for its attention to detail and vivid colors. Boluminski's most famous piece is perhaps his 1898 painting titled "Der Pfeifenraucher" or "The Pipe Smoker," a portrait of an old man smoking a pipe in a rustic setting. This painting is now part of the collection of the Kunsthalle Bremen museum. Apart from his artistic pursuits, Boluminski was also an avid hiker and nature enthusiast. He often used his outdoor experiences as inspiration for his paintings. Despite his relatively short career, Boluminski is considered an important figure in the German art scene of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to the art world, Franz Boluminski was also involved in social and political causes. He was a member of the Social Democratic Party and used his artwork to promote socialist ideals such as the fight against poverty and the struggle for workers' rights. Boluminski often depicted working-class individuals in his paintings, giving them visibility and representation in a time when they were often marginalized in mainstream art. His work was thus seen as both aesthetically pleasing and socially relevant. Despite his association with socialism, Boluminski was also known for his patriotism and support for the German Empire. He painted portraits of prominent figures such as Kaiser Wilhelm II and participated in nationalist exhibitions. Boluminski's complex views on politics and society reflect the tensions of his time and continue to inspire debates among art historians and scholars.</p><p></p><p>
