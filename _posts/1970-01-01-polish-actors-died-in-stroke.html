							Bareja is best known for his satirical films which often mocked the bureaucracy and inefficiencies of Poland's Communist government. He rose to popularity in the 1970s with films such as "Było sobie miasteczko" ("Once Upon a Time There Was a Town") and "Poszukiwany, poszukiwana" ("Man Wanted, Woman Wanted"). His films were frequently censored by the government but still managed to draw large audiences. Bareja was also a popular actor, often appearing in his own films as well as in the works of other directors. Despite his success, Bareja was known for his modesty and down-to-earth personality. His sudden death in 1987 from a heart attack at the age of 57 came as a shock to many in the Polish film community.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=4036764" title="Wikipedia article about Stanisław Bareja">Stanisław Bareja on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>George E.
