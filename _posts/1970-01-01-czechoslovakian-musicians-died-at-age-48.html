(December 1, 1909		Opava-July 10, 1958			Brno)


was
a Czechoslovakian
writer.


					</p><p>Bardon was best known for his works on Hermeticism and spiritual development, particularly his books "Initiation into Hermetics," "The Practice of Magical Evocation" and "The Key to the True Kabbalah." He claimed to have been taught the secrets of these practices by a group of spiritual masters known as the "Brotherhood of the White Lodge." Bardon's teachings have influenced a number of occult and magical groups, and his work continues to be studied by individuals interested in Hermeticism and esoteric spirituality. Despite experiencing persecution by the Nazi regime due to his writings, Bardon's work has remained popular and influential in the spiritual community.</p><p>Bardon grew up in a family of craftsmen and attended school until the age of 13. After working in various trades, including as a stage magician, he began to study Hermeticism and other forms of esoteric spirituality. Bardon's teachings emphasized the importance of spiritual development and personal transformation, and he provided a detailed system of exercises and practices for his students to follow. He also stressed the importance of ethical behavior and personal responsibility in spiritual growth. Bardon's influence can be seen in the work of other spiritual teachers and writers, including Israel Regardie and Franz Hartmann. In addition to his books on Hermeticism, Bardon also wrote on astrology and alchemy. Today, his work continues to be studied and practiced by individuals seeking spiritual growth and understanding.</p><p>Throughout his life, Bardon faced numerous struggles and challenges, including persecution by the Nazi regime and imprisonment for his political beliefs. Despite these obstacles, he remained committed to his spiritual work and continued to write and teach until his death. In addition to his written works, Bardon also provided personal instruction to a small group of dedicated students. His teachings have been described as highly detailed and systematic, providing a comprehensive approach to spiritual development.</p><p>Many of Bardon's ideas and practices have been integrated into the wider New Age movement, and his work continues to inspire spiritual seekers around the world. However, his methods have also been criticized by some as overly prescriptive and lacking in flexibility. Regardless of these debates, the influence of Franz Bardon on esoteric spirituality and magical practice cannot be denied. His legacy as a spiritual teacher, author, and practitioner endures to this day.</p><p></p><p>

He also wrote several notable plays, including "The Insect Play," "The Makropulos Affair," and "R.U.R.," which stands for Rossum's Universal Robots. The latter play, which premiered in 1921, is considered his most famous work and is credited with popularizing the word "robot" in the English language.
