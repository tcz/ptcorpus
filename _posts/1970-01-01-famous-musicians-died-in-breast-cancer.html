an American
actor, singer-songwriter, comedian, dancer and presenter.


					</p><p>She is best known for her role as Mammy in the 1939 film 'Gone with the Wind', for which she became the first African American to win an Academy Award. Throughout her career, McDaniel appeared in over 300 films and became the first African American women to sing on American radio. Despite the success she achieved, McDaniel faced discrimination and racial barriers throughout her life. She used her platform to advocate for civil rights, often speaking out against racial injustices in Hollywood. McDaniel passed away from breast cancer in 1952 at the age of 57. Her legacy lives on as a trailblazer for African American actors and performers in Hollywood.</p><p>McDaniel was born in Wichita, Kansas to former slaves. Her family moved to Denver, Colorado where she began her career performing in minstrel shows as a teenager. In the 1920s, she moved to Los Angeles and started to gain recognition as a performer in vaudeville shows and in radio. She was often cast in stereotypical roles as a maid or servant, but nonetheless continued to work and perform.</p><p>McDaniel also became an active participant in Hollywood's political scene, joining the Hollywood Democratic Committee and speaking out against segregation in public places. She also co-founded the Negro Actors Guild in 1937 to advocate for better treatment of African American performers in Hollywood.</p><p>After her Oscar win, McDaniel continued to act in films, but often in smaller roles. She also continued to work in radio, hosting her own show, The Beulah Show. McDaniel's portrayal of the character Beulah in the show, however, eventually faced criticism for perpetuating negative stereotypes of African American women.</p><p>Despite the challenges she faced, McDaniel had a groundbreaking career that paved the way for future generations of African American actors and performers. In 1975, she was posthumously inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame.</p><p>In addition to her accomplishments in entertainment and activism, Hattie McDaniel was also a noted philanthropist. She used her success to give back to her community by donating to charitable causes and hosting benefit concerts. During WWII, she purchased over $50,000 worth of war bonds and sold them at rallies to support the war effort. McDaniel was also known for her generosity towards aspiring entertainers, often providing encouragement and financial support to those in need. Her legacy continues to inspire and pave the way for future generations. In recent years, there have been calls for her Oscar to be posthumously rescinded due to the racial stereotypes perpetuated by her character in 'Gone with the Wind', but her impact on African American representation in Hollywood remains an important part of film history.</p><p></p><p>

In 1963, she founded the Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York, which provided a platform for experimental artists to showcase their work.
