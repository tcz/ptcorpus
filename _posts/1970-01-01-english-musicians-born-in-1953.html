Some of his notable works include "Turning the Place Over" and "Butterfly", which were both featured in Liverpool as part of the city's celebration as European Capital of Culture in 2008.</p><p>Wilson's work often explores the relationship between art and the environment, and he has created a number of site-specific installations in various locations, including one in London's Olympic Park. Wilson is also an accomplished musician and has released several albums in collaboration with other artists.</p><p>Wilson's work has been exhibited extensively both nationally and internationally, with solo shows at the Saatchi Gallery in London, the Louisiana Museum in Denmark, and the De Pont Museum in the Netherlands, among others.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2016 for his services to the arts.</p><p>Wilson's impressive career in art began in the 1980s when he gained recognition for his reconstruction of objects and environments, which challenged the viewers' perception and understanding of space. One of his early works, "20:50", consisted of a room filled with recycled engine oil, creating a reflective surface that distorted the viewer's sense of depth.Perhaps his most well-known work, "Turning the Place Over", was a large-scale installation in Liverpool that consisted of a rotating section of a building's facade, causing passersby to question their perception of the environment around them. Wilson's work often includes a sense of playfulness and humor, as demonstrated in "Slice of Reality", a sculpture created in collaboration with Tim Hunkin, which is a giant sausage complete with condiments that rotates on a spit.Wilson's work has been an inspiration to many artists, and he has been recognized for his contributions to the arts through numerous awards and fellowships, including an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Wales and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Leicester. Wilson's passion for art and its ability to alter the very fabric of reality shows no signs of waning, and he continues to create innovative and thought-provoking installations that push the limits of artistic practice.</p><p></p><p>
