(October 10, 1560		Oudewater-October 19, 1609			Leiden)

	
		also known as James Arminius

	
was
a Dutch
philosopher.


					</p><p>He was a professor of theology at the University of Leiden and became known for his views on predestination and free will, which were at odds with the teachings of the dominant Calvinist church. Arminius believed that humans had the ability to choose or reject salvation, which was considered heretical at the time. His teachings led to a split in the Dutch Reformed Church and the formation of the Remonstrant Brotherhood, a group that rejected predestination and advocated for religious tolerance. Arminius died before the formal split occurred, but his ideas continued to shape religious debates for centuries. Today, his name is often associated with the theological movement known as Arminianism.</p><p>Arminius was born in Oudewater, a small town in the Netherlands, to a family of modest means. He studied theology at the University of Leiden and became a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. However, his views on predestination and free will soon put him at odds with the church's teachings, and he began to question Calvinism.</p><p>Arminius became a professor of theology at the University of Leiden in 1603, where he developed a reputation as a skilled theologian and scholar. He rejected the idea of unconditional election and believed that humans had a choice in the matter of salvation.</p><p>His views were controversial, and he faced opposition from the Calvinist establishment. Arminius engaged in vigorous debates and wrote extensively on his beliefs, seeking to reconcile them with the teachings of the church.</p><p>After his death, his followers formed the Remonstrant Brotherhood, which became a separate church outside of the Dutch Reformed Church. The split was contentious, with both sides engaging in bitter theological debates, but Arminius' teachings and ideas continued to influence Christian theology for centuries.</p><p>Today, Arminianism is a widely recognized theological movement that embraces the beliefs of free will and salvation available to all who believe. Arminius' legacy also includes the establishment of religious tolerance, which remains a fundamental value for many people of faith.</p><p></p><p>
