						Butterworth was born into an affluent family and showed an early aptitude for music. He studied at Eton College and the University of Oxford, where he became friends with fellow composers Ralph Vaughan Williams and Gustav Holst. His compositions were strongly influenced by the English folk tradition and the landscape of the countryside.</p><p>In 1914, Butterworth volunteered for military service in World War I and served as a lieutenant in the Durham Light Infantry. He was killed in action at the Battle of the Somme in 1916. His death was a huge loss to the world of music, as he was considered one of the most promising young composers of his time.</p><p>Butterworth's most famous work is the orchestral rhapsody "A Shropshire Lad," which was based on poems by A.E. Housman. His other works include songs, chamber music, and arrangements of traditional folk tunes. Today, he is remembered as a significant figure in the English musical renaissance of the early 20th century.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=175469" title="Wikipedia article about George Butterworth">George Butterworth on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/singaporean-musicians-died-at-age-74.html' title='Singaporean musicians died at age 74'><strong>Singaporean musicians died at age 74</strong> List of the top 1 Singaporean music stars who died when they were 74</a></li><li><a href='/italian-actresses-died-in-breast-cancer.html' title='Italian actresses died in Breast cancer'><strong>Italian actresses died in Breast cancer</strong> List of the top 2 Italian actresses who died in Breast cancer</a></li><li><a href='/american-actresses-died-in-1981.html' title='American actresses died in 1981'><strong>American actresses died in 1981</strong> List of the top 35 American actresses who died in 1981</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swedish-actresses-died-in-traffic-collision.html' title='Swedish actresses died in Traffic collision'><strong>Swedish actresses died in Traffic collision</strong> List of the top 1 Swedish actresses who died in Traffic collision</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-edema.html' title='Famous actors died in Edema'><strong>Famous actors died in Edema</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actors who died in Edema</a></li><li><a href='/estonian-musicians-died-at-age-53.html' title='Estonian musicians died at age 53'><strong>Estonian musicians died at age 53</strong> List of the top 1 Estonian music stars who died when they were 53</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
