personality.


					</p><p>Gustav Jenner was a composer, conductor, and music teacher who is best known for being a student and disciple of Johannes Brahms. Under Brahms' instruction, Jenner developed his composing style, which was heavily influenced by the Romantic period. After Brahms' death, Jenner continued to compose and had his works performed in various cities across Europe. He also spent many years teaching at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt and later at the University of Marburg, where he mentored notable composers such as Paul Hindemith. Despite his significant contributions to classical music, Jenner's works fell into obscurity after his death, but they have since been rediscovered and are performed by various orchestras and ensembles.</p><p>Jenner grew up in a musically-oriented family, with his mother being a trained pianist and his father an amateur musician. It was his mother who gave him his first piano lessons, which he continued to take with her until her untimely death from tuberculosis when he was only 12 years old. Following her death, Jenner moved with his father to Hamburg, where he began studying composition with the prominent composer and conductor, Julius Reubke.</p><p>At the age of 20, Jenner entered the Leipzig Conservatory, where he studied composition with Salomon Jadassohn and Heinrich von Herzogenberg. It was during this time that Jenner began to develop his own unique style, incorporating Brahmsian influences as well as elements of German folk music into his compositions.</p><p>After completing his studies in Leipzig, Jenner moved to Vienna, where he became a private pupil of Brahms. Brahms was impressed by Jenner's talent and took him under his wing, teaching him composition and helping him establish connections with publishers and concert promoters. The two became close friends, and Jenner remained a devoted disciple of Brahms even after his mentor's death in 1897.</p><p>Jenner's own compositions, which include symphonies, chamber music, and lieder, are characterized by their lyricism, rich harmonies, and use of folk music motifs. Despite their quality, however, they were largely forgotten in the years after Jenner's death, and it was not until the middle of the 20th century that they began to receive renewed attention from musicians and scholars. Today, Jenner's music is recognized as a valuable contribution to the late Romantic period and continues to be performed and recorded by musicians around the world.</p><p></p><p>

He was a leader of the German National People's Party and served as Minister of Economics in the government of Chancellor Wilhelm Cuno. However, his health began to decline in the early 1920s, and he died of a heart attack in 1924. </p><p>Stinnes' legacy has been the subject of much debate, with some viewing him as a ruthless capitalist who exploited workers and built his fortune on the backs of others.

(August 27, 1776		Copenhagen-January 2, 1831			Bonn)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Barthold Georg Niebuhr was a historian and statesman who is considered a pioneer in the area of modern German historiography. He grew up in the household of his father, a prominent Lutheran theologian, and received a classical education. Niebuhr was fluent in Latin and gained experience in scholarship, journalism, and diplomatic work throughout his life. </p><p>Niebuhr's most important literary work was his "Roman History," which he wrote between 1811 and 1832. This work traces the early history of Rome to the third Punic War (149-146 BCE), and his approach of using primary sources and critical analysis revolutionized historical writing. Niebuhr argued that history was not a sequence of inevitable events but rather the product of the actions of individuals and cultural forces.</p><p>In addition to his historical work, Niebuhr was also active in politics. In 1816, he was appointed as the Prussian ambassador to the Vatican, and he later served as the Prussian envoy to the court of St. James's in London. Despite his background in scholarship and diplomacy, Niebuhr was often frustrated with politics and criticized government corruption.</p><p>Niebuhr's contributions to the field of history and his advocacy for individual freedom and the rule of law made him an important figure in German intellectual history. His insights and methods helped shape the way modern historians approach their work, and his influence can be seen in the works of many later scholars.</p><p>In addition to his work as a historian and statesman, Barthold Georg Niebuhr was also a devoted family man. He married his wife, Anna Karoline, in 1804, and they had seven children together. Niebuhr was known to be a devoted and involved father, and he wrote numerous letters to his wife and children while he was away on diplomatic missions. He also suffered personal tragedies during his life, including the loss of his son Alexander and daughter Thérèse. Despite these challenges, Niebuhr remained committed to his work and continued writing until his death in 1831. His legacy continues to be celebrated today, with numerous institutions and memorials named in his honor.</p><p></p><p>

(April 14, 1882		Berlin-June 22, 1936			Vienna)

	
		a.k.a. Friedrich Albert Moritz Schlick

	
was
a German
philosopher.


					</p><p>Schlick is best known for his work in the philosophy of language and the development of Logical Positivism. He was a key member of the Vienna Circle, a group of philosophers who sought to develop a scientific and empirical approach to philosophy. Schlick's contributions to this movement helped to shape the direction of 20th-century philosophy.</p><p>Prior to his involvement in Logical Positivism, Schlick was a professor of philosophy at the University of Rostock and the University of Kiel. He also served as the editor of the philosophy journal 'Erkenntnis'. However, his involvement with the Vienna Circle and his advocacy of their ideas eventually led to his untimely death.</p><p>On June 22, 1936, Schlick was shot and killed by a former student in the hallway of the University of Vienna. The assassination shocked the philosophical community and created a sense of fear and uncertainty amongst intellectuals in Nazi Germany. Nonetheless, Schlick's ideas and contributions to philosophy continue to be studied and debated to this day.</p><p>Schlick's work in the philosophy of language was centered around the idea that language should be viewed as a tool for communication rather than a means for expressing absolute truths about the world. He argued that linguistic propositions should be analyzed in terms of their verifiability, and rejected the idea that unverifiable statements have any meaning or relevance. Schlick's ideas contributed to the development of the verification principle, a core concept of Logical Positivism.</p><p>In addition to his work in philosophy, Schlick was an accomplished violinist and a lover of classical music. He wrote a book called "Space and Time in Contemporary Physics" which explores the concepts of space and time in relation to physics. Schlick was married to Herta Leug and had two sons, Peter and Wolfgang.</p><p>Schlick's death was a tragic loss for the philosophical world, as he was only 54 years old at the time. However, his ideas and contributions to philosophy continue to influence the field and shape discussions today.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by assassination.
