was
a Dutch
personality.


					</p><p>Born in Groningen, he was raised in a musical family and showed an early talent for playing the violin. He studied music at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague but dropped out to pursue a career in jazz. Ankerman quickly became known as one of the most talented jazz violinists in Europe and formed his own band, which gained popularity both in the Netherlands and abroad. However, his career was cut short by the outbreak of World War II. </p><p>During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Ankerman became involved with the resistance and used his musical talent to help hide Jewish musicians and smuggle resistance fighters and Jewish people out of the country. He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1942 and was eventually executed in a concentration camp later that year. Despite his young age, Ankerman left behind a legacy as a highly influential and innovative jazz musician, and as a hero of the Dutch resistance movement.</p><p></p><p>
