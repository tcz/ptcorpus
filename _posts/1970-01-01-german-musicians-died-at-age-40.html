(June 13, 1893		Germany-October 11, 1933			Osnabrück)


was
a German
engineer, aerobatic pilot and pilot.


					</p><p>Tiling was instrumental in the development of the Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri, the world's first series production helicopter. Before his work on the Kolibri, Tiling designed and built his own aircraft, the Tiling Taifun, which he used to perform aerobatic stunts in air shows across Europe. Tiling also designed and built a variety of gliders, including the Tiling-Weinhardt, which set a world altitude record in 1929. Tragically, Tiling died in a plane crash in 1933 while testing a new aircraft design. Despite his early death, Tiling's contributions to aviation have had a lasting impact on the field, particularly in the area of helicopter design.</p><p>Tiling began his career in aviation during World War I, where he served as a reconnaissance pilot. After the war, he studied engineering and worked as an aircraft designer for several companies. In the mid-1920s, Tiling began experimenting with helicopter designs and quickly gained a reputation as a talented and innovative engineer.</p><p>In addition to his work as a designer and pilot, Tiling was also an accomplished writer and photographer. He authored several books on aviation, including "Modern Helicopter Construction" and "Aeronautics for Everyone."</p><p>After his death, Tiling's legacy lived on in the form of the Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri, which went on to be used extensively by the German military during World War II. Tiling's contributions to helicopter design helped pave the way for the development of modern helicopters and his impact on the field continues to be felt to this day.</p><p>The Tiling Taifun, which Tiling designed and built prior to his work on the Kolibri, was an innovative aircraft that featured a unique wing design. Tiling's use of swept-back wings and ailerons helped to improve the aircraft's stability and control, and the Taifun quickly became popular among pilots and aviation enthusiasts. Tiling also designed and built a variety of gliders throughout his career, including the Tiling-Weinhardt, which set a world altitude record in 1929 by flying to an altitude of 49,426 feet.</p><p>Tiling's work on the Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri was groundbreaking and helped to establish the modern helicopter as we know it today. The Kolibri was the first helicopter to be mass-produced and was used extensively by the German military during World War II for reconnaissance and rescue missions. Tiling's innovations, including a fully articulated rotor system, advanced control mechanisms, and a lightweight yet durable airframe, helped to make the Kolibri a reliable and effective aircraft.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments in the field of aviation, Tiling's life was tragically cut short when he died in a plane crash while testing a new aircraft design. However, his contributions to the field live on and his impact on helicopter design and engineering continue to be felt to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(October 15, 1830		Niederbreitbach-March 28, 1871)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>James Wirth was a prominent German-American journalist, author, and political activist who played a significant role in the 19th-century labor and socialist movements in the United States. He was a co-founder of the First International Workingmen's Association, which aimed to unite workers across national and ideological lines to fight for their rights and interests.</p><p>Wirth immigrated to the United States in 1848 and quickly became involved in radical politics. He was a prolific writer who contributed to socialist and labor newspapers and authored several books, including "The American Worker's Movement," a seminal work on the history of the labor movement in the United States.</p><p>Wirth was also a tireless organizer and advocate for workers' rights. He helped to organize strikes and protests, including the 1867 railroad strike that drew national attention to the plight of American workers. He worked closely with figures such as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who respected him as a passionate and dedicated champion of the working class.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Wirth's life was cut tragically short by smallpox in 1871. His death was mourned by thousands of workers and activists across the United States and Europe, who recognized him as a true hero of the labor movement.</p><p>Wirth's dedication to the labor movement and his advocacy for workers' rights had a lasting impact on American history. His work helped lay the foundation for the American labor movement, which became a significant force in the country's politics and social change. Many of the issues Wirth fought for, such as the eight-hour workday, workplace safety laws, and collective bargaining, continue to shape American labor policy today. </p><p>Wirth's legacy also extends beyond the labor movement. He was a staunch advocate for social justice, believing that workers' struggles were intimately tied to issues of racial and gender equality. He fought against slavery and supported women's suffrage, becoming one of the first male activists to recognize the connection between gender and labor rights. </p><p>Today, James Wirth is remembered as a pioneer of the American labor movement and a champion for the rights of workers and marginalized communities. His life and work continue to inspire generations of activists fighting for social and economic justice.</p><p>In addition to his activism, writing, and organizing, James Wirth was also involved in politics, running for office several times. He was a member of the Socialist Labor Party and sought election to various local and state offices, including the New York State Assembly. While he was not successful in these campaigns, he continued to use his platform to advocate for workers' rights and socialist ideals.</p><p>Wirth's international connections were also noteworthy. As a leading figure in the First International Workingmen's Association, he built relationships with labor activists and scholars from around the world. He corresponded with prominent figures such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, and Victor Hugo, and he helped to promote their ideas in the United States.</p><p>After his death, Wirth's contributions to the labor movement were recognized by many of his contemporaries. In 1888, the Knights of Labor erected a monument in his honor at his gravesite in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery. The monument features a bust of Wirth and an inscription that reads, in part, "Founder of the United States Labor Movement." Today, Wirth's legacy is remembered and celebrated by labor activists and scholars, who recognize the pivotal role he played in advancing the cause of workers' rights in the United States.</p><p></p><p>
