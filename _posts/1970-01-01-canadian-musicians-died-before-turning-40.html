He was also influenced by the Romantic poets, particularly John Keats. He published his first book of poetry, "Among the Millet and Other Poems", in 1888, which was well received by critics. Lampman went on to publish more collections of poetry, including "Lyrics of Earth" (1895) and "Alcyone" (1899), which was published posthumously. </p><p>In addition to his poetry, Lampman was also known for his literary criticism, and was a regular contributor to the Canadian Magazine, where he wrote reviews of books and poetry.

was
a Canadian
personality.


					</p><p>David Reimer was born Bruce Peter Reimer and was a victim of a botched circumcision at the age of 8 months in which his penis was destroyed beyond repair. As a result, his parents turned to Dr. John Money, a sex researcher at Johns Hopkins University, who advised them to raise Bruce as a female, Brenda, and undergo genital reconstruction surgery.</p><p>Bruce underwent hormone therapy and surgery to create female genitalia, and was raised as Brenda, but he never identified as female and struggled with depression and feelings of being trapped in the wrong body throughout his childhood and adolescence. Despite the trauma and complications, Dr. Money touted the case as a success story in support of his theory that gender identity was learned rather than innate.</p><p>In his early 20s, Bruce decided to transition back to male and underwent hormone therapy and a double mastectomy to remove the breasts that had developed as a result of the feminizing hormones. He later underwent phalloplasty surgery to construct a penis, but the surgery was also unsuccessful.</p><p>In the years after his transition, David became an advocate for intersex and transgender rights, speaking out against the harm caused by the medicalization of gender and the notion of gender being binary. Tragically, he died by suicide in 2004, leaving behind a wife and twin sons. His story has been the subject of numerous documentaries and studies, and has had a significant impact on the understanding and treatment of intersex and transgender individuals.</p><p>David Reimer’s story is often used to illustrate the complexity of gender identity and how harmful it can be when individuals are forced to conform to societal norms. Despite the traumatic experiences he went through, Reimer remained dedicated to advocating for intersex and transgender rights. He also co-authored a book titled “As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl” which documented his experiences and became a bestseller. David’s legacy continues to inspire efforts to support and protect the rights of intersex and transgender individuals.</p><p>David Reimer’s legacy has had a long-lasting impact on the field of psychology as well. His case was one of the factors that exposed the flaws in Dr. Money’s theory of gender identity, and led to a significant shift in thinking about gender and sexuality. Today, medical professionals view gender identity as a complex and multifaceted aspect of individual identity that is not necessarily tied to biology. David’s case has also raised important ethical questions about the medical treatment of intersex individuals and the role of gender in society. His life and work continue to inspire ongoing efforts to promote gender equity and inclusivity.</p><p></p><p>

physicist and chemist.


					</p><p>Slotin was a member of the Manhattan Project, the secret research project that developed the first nuclear weapons during World War II. He was known for his expertise in the workings of nuclear weapons, and he had a reputation for being a risk-taker. </p><p>On May 21, 1946, Slotin was performing a demonstration of an experiment with a core of enriched uranium for colleagues at Los Alamos. The experiment involved manually bringing two halves of a beryllium-coated plutonium sphere together with a screwdriver, which would initiate a chain reaction. However, Slotin's screwdriver slipped, causing the halves to come too close together and triggering a burst of radiation.</p><p>Slotin immediately pushed the halves apart with his bare hands, exposing himself and seven other people in the room to deadly levels of radiation. He died nine days later from radiation poisoning. </p><p>The incident, known as the "Louis Slotin accident," was one of the worst nuclear accidents in history and led to significant changes in the safety protocols for handling nuclear materials. Slotin received a posthumous award for courage and heroism from the U.S. Army.</p><p>In addition to his work on the Manhattan Project, Louis Slotin also made significant contributions to the field of cosmic rays, the high-energy particles that originate from space. He was part of a team that studied these particles using balloons launched into the stratosphere. Slotin also worked on the development of the first nuclear reactors and helped to design the first reactor to produce electricity. Slotin was highly regarded by his colleagues for his experimental skills and his ability to think creatively about complex problems. After his death, a memorial plaque was placed in his honor at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he had worked. The plaque reads, "In memory of Louis Alexander Slotin, who sacrificed his life, July 1946, so that his colleagues might live." The incident involving Slotin's death was later dramatized in the play and movie "The Manhattan Project."</p><p>Louis Slotin was born to Jewish immigrants who had moved to Canada from Ukraine. He showed an early interest in science and went on to study chemistry and physics at the University of Manitoba. After completing his undergraduate degree, he went on to earn a Master's degree in chemistry from King's College in London. Slotin then returned to Canada and began teaching at the University of Manitoba, where he worked on research related to nuclear physics.</p><p>In 1943, Slotin was recruited to join the Manhattan Project and was sent to work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. He quickly became known for his skill in handling nuclear materials and was soon put in charge of overseeing critical experiments related to the development of the atomic bomb.</p><p>Despite his reputation as a risk-taker, Slotin was also known for his devotion to safety. He frequently spoke out against unsafe practices and was responsible for implementing several safety measures that saved lives during the Manhattan Project.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Slotin was also a talented musician and a passionate advocate for social justice. He was an outspoken critic of racism and discrimination and was known for using his platform as a scientist to speak out against injustice.</p><p>Despite the tragic circumstances of his death, Slotin's contributions to the development of the atomic bomb and nuclear technology continue to be remembered and celebrated by scientists and historians alike.

He died the next day in a field hospital.</p><p>Flowerdew's heroism and sacrifice were widely praised in Canada and Britain, and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest honor for military valor in the British Empire. His wife Adeline accepted the award on behalf of her late husband, and his citation read:</p><p>"For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty when in command of a squadron detailed for special work, he himself led the unit in a charge through a very heavy curtain of fire which was holding up the advance. The enemy's machine guns were dealt with, and the line was captured. Later, when the enemy became very active and subsequently outnumbered our men, this officer, knowing the risk attached to the move and realizing the importance of holding onto the position at all costs, led a second successful charge. His courage and dash in the face of heavy fire inspired the greatest confidence in his men, particularly when he led them in the capture of so important an objective."</p><p>Flowerdew's legacy as a brave and selfless soldier has been honored in many ways. In addition to the Gordon Flowerdew Trophy, his name appears on several memorials and plaques, including a monument in Moreuil and a plaque at the Vimy Memorial in France. His story has also been told in several books, including "The Great War as I Saw It" by Captain George Pearson, one of his fellow officers.</p><p>After his death, Gordon Flowerdew's remains were laid to rest at the Moreuil British Cemetery, and his name was inscribed on the Vimy Memorial. In addition to his posthumous Victoria Cross, he was also awarded the Croix de Guerre with Palm by the French government. Flowerdew's bravery and leadership during the Battle of Moreuil Wood continues to inspire generations of Canadian soldiers and is celebrated as a defining moment in Canadian military history. His legacy has been further memorialized in a portrait by renowned Canadian artist, Alfred Joseph Casson, which hangs in the National War Memorial in Ottawa.
