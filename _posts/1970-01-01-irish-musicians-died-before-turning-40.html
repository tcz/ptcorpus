(June 7, 1892		Stradbally-July 10, 1927			Dublin)


was
an Irish
politician.


					</p><p>Kevin O'Higgins was a prominent figure in the Irish War of Independence and served as Minister for Justice in the Irish Free State government from 1922 until his untimely death in 1927. He was a key architect of the Irish legal system and played a significant role in the establishment of An Garda Síochána, Ireland's national police force. O'Higgins was a staunch defender of the Irish Free State and opposed any efforts to reunite Ireland under British rule. His assassination by Republicans was a major blow to the fledgling Irish government and sent shockwaves throughout the country. Despite his controversial legacy, O'Higgins is remembered as one of the most influential figures in modern Irish history.</p><p>Before becoming a politician, Kevin O'Higgins was a successful barrister who quickly gained a reputation as a skilled legal mind. He was also a prolific writer and authored several books on Irish history and law. O'Higgins was deeply involved in the Irish Nationalist movement from a young age and was one of the founders of the Sinn Féin party. However, his political beliefs shifted after the 1916 Easter Rising, which he saw as a misguided and failed rebellion. </p><p>During the Irish War of Independence, O'Higgins was a close confidant of Michael Collins and played a crucial role in the intelligence operations that helped the Irish Republican Army (IRA) gain the upper hand against the British forces. After the conflict, he was appointed Minister for Justice and immediately set about reforming the Irish legal system. He introduced a number of new laws that modernized the country's legal code and created a more efficient and effective justice system. </p><p>O'Higgins was also responsible for establishing An Garda Síochána, which he envisioned as a civilian police force that would be accountable to the government and free from the corruption that had plagued earlier police forces in Ireland. He was a staunch opponent of vigilante justice and sought to establish the rule of law throughout the country. </p><p>O'Higgins' assassination is widely believed to have been carried out by Republicans who were unhappy with his hardline stance on law and order and his opposition to reunification. His death was a major blow to the Irish government and plunged the country into a period of political turmoil. Despite his controversial legacy, O'Higgins is remembered as a key figure in the establishment of the Irish Free State and a champion of the rule of law.</p><p>Kevin O'Higgins' assassination on July 10, 1927, took place just four months after the assassination of another prominent politician, his close friend and ally, Kevin O'Reilly. The killings were part of a wider campaign of violence and intimidation by anti-Treaty Republicans who opposed the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the establishment of the Irish Free State. O'Higgins' death was a major setback to the Irish government and a source of deep shock and sorrow for the Irish people, who saw him as a courageous and dedicated public servant. He was given a state funeral and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin. In the years since his death, O'Higgins has been the subject of numerous biographies and studies, and his legacy continues to be a topic of debate and discussion in Ireland.</p><p>Despite Kevin O'Higgins' brief career in politics, he left a lasting impact on Irish society. His work as Minister for Justice transformed the Irish legal system and helped establish a more stable and transparent government. O'Higgins' commitment to the rule of law and his opposition to vigilantism and extrajudicial violence helped pave the way for a more peaceful and democratic Ireland. His legacy remains controversial, however, as some see his hardline approach to law and order as a betrayal of the principles of the Irish nationalist movement. Nevertheless, O'Higgins' contributions to Irish politics and society continue to be studied and debated, and his assassination remains a tragic reminder of the violence and division that plagued Ireland during the early years of its independence.</p><p></p><p>

was
an Irish
politician.


					</p><p>William Joyce was actually a notorious fascist politician and propagandist who was born in Brooklyn to an Irish immigrant family. He moved to England with his family as a child and later became a naturalized British citizen. During World War II, Joyce became a prominent figure in fascist and Nazi propaganda, broadcasting radio propaganda on behalf of the Germans under the nickname "Lord Haw Haw". He was known for his British-accented English and mocking tone towards the British people. In 1945, he was captured by British forces and brought to trial for treason, resulting in his hanging in 1946 at HM Prison Wandsworth. His execution was controversial and sparked debate about the legality of executing someone for treason when they were not a citizen of the country they were accused of betraying.</p><p>Joyce was a highly controversial figure during his time, with some regarding him as a traitor while others saw him as a misunderstood outsider. He was known for his anti-Semitic views and support of Adolf Hitler, and his broadcasts were intended to demoralize the British public during the war.

Despite his notoriety, Joyce remains a figure of interest for historians and political scholars, with many continuing to analyze his motivations and influence.</p><p>Despite his controversial and infamous reputation, William Joyce's childhood was relatively ordinary. He attended school in England and later worked as a golf caddy and journalist. It wasn't until the 1930s that he became involved in far-right politics and began associating with various fascist groups. He eventually joined the British Union of Fascists led by Oswald Mosley and became a prominent member. </p><p>After the outbreak of World War II, Joyce fled to Germany and began working for Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, who recognized Joyce's talent for broadcasting. Joyce's radio broadcasts, which were heard by millions of British listeners, were designed to undermine morale and encourage defeatism. </p><p>Joyce's arrest and trial for treason were controversial, as the British government accused him of betraying a country he wasn't a citizen of. Despite this, he was found guilty and later executed. Many historians have debated his legacy and the impact of his propaganda broadcasts.</p><p>Joyce's wife, Margaret, also played a pivotal role in his life and career. The two married in 1937 and later moved to Germany together. Margaret was also involved in fascist politics and even took on the role of broadcasting propaganda on behalf of the Germans in a program aimed at British female listeners. She was arrested after the war and served a prison sentence for her involvement in Nazi propaganda activities. </p><p>Joyce's influence and notoriety continue to be felt today. He remains a symbol of the dangers of extremist views and propaganda, and his case has been cited in debates about free speech and the limits of political expression. Despite his infamy, Joyce's life and career remain a subject of fascination and study for many, as historians and political scholars continue to explore the depths of his motivations and beliefs.</p><p></p><p>

(January 24, 1832		County Wexford-December 27, 1865			Westminster)


was
an Irish
sailor.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work in developing marine chronometers, which were key in solving the problem of accurately determining longitude while at sea. One of his most famous creations was the H4, a portable chronometer that was smaller and more reliable than previous models. This invention won him a substantial reward from the British government, but he faced significant opposition from members of the scientific community who were resistant to change. Despite the challenges, Harrison's work had a profound impact on navigation and earned him a lasting legacy as a pioneer in the field of timekeeping.</p><p>Harrison was born into a seafaring family with a long tradition of excellence in sailing. He spent much of his early life at sea, working on various ships and developing a deep understanding of the challenges of navigation. His interest in marine chronometers began in his early twenties, when he encountered the problem of accurately determining longitude while on a long sea voyage. </p><p>After several years of experimentation and tinkering, Harrison successfully developed the H4, which was a breakthrough in chronometer design. The H4 was highly accurate and reliable, even in the harsh conditions of the open ocean. The British government recognized the value of the invention and awarded Harrison a prize of £20,000 in 1773, which was a staggering sum of money at the time.</p><p>Despite his success, Harrison faced significant opposition from the scientific establishment. Many prominent scientists and mathematicians believed that the problem of longitude could only be solved through astronomical observations, rather than mechanical timekeeping. Harrison spent many years defending his work and attempting to persuade skeptics of the value of his method. </p><p>Today, Harrison is widely regarded as a genius of mechanical engineering and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of timekeeping. His work paved the way for the development of accurate marine navigation, which was crucial to the success of trade and exploration in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p><p>Harrison continued to innovate in the field of chronometers and designed several more models after the H4, each one more precise and reliable than the last. He also worked on other inventions, including a marine barometer and a mechanism for preventing ships from rolling in heavy seas. However, he faced continued criticism and opposition from those who held to traditional methods of navigation. </p><p>In his later years, Harrison suffered from poor health and financial difficulties. He sought additional recognition and support for his work from the British government, but was largely unsuccessful. Despite these challenges, Harrison's contributions to science and navigation were widely recognized during his lifetime, and his name remains synonymous with precision timekeeping. His story has inspired numerous books, films, and even an opera, and his legacy lives on in modern marine navigation technology.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions, the British government awarded Harrison a series of pensions over the years, but he struggled financially for much of his life. Harrison died in 1776 at the age of 83, and he was buried in Hampstead. Despite the challenges and obstacles he faced, Harrison's legacy has endured. His inventions revolutionized navigation, contributing to the success of trade, exploration, and military expeditions. His work also had a profound impact on scientific understanding of time and measurement, paving the way for advances in astronomy, physics, and engineering. Today, Harrison is celebrated as one of the most important inventors in history, honored in museums, festivals, and academic institutions around the world. The story of his life and work is a testament to the power of ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance in pursuit of knowledge and progress.</p><p></p><p>

Sadly, Moore died at the age of 37 from tuberculosis, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest footballers in Irish history.</p><p>Moore was born in Ballyclare, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, in 1895. He began his football career at a young age and played for several local teams before joining Linfield in 1919. He quickly established himself as a top-class forward and became known for his speed, ball control, and goalscoring ability.</p><p>Moore was instrumental in Linfield's dominance of the Irish League during the 1920s.
