(June 21, 1900		Taechon County-September 19, 1976			Pyongyang)


was
a North Korean
politician.


					</p><p>He served as the vice premier of North Korea from 1957 until his death in 1976. He was a trusted aide to founding leader Kim Il-sung and played a key role in the country's postwar economic development. In the 1960s, he advocated for the country's shift towards economic self-reliance and the development of heavy industry. He was also known for his work advocating for the reunification of North and South Korea. Despite his close ties to Kim Il-sung, he was reportedly purged in 1977, a year after his death, during a political crackdown.</p><p>Choe Yong-gon's involvement in politics began at a young age when he joined the Korean independence movement against Japanese rule in the 1920s. He was also a founding member of the Korean Workers' Party, which later became the ruling party in North Korea. Throughout his long career, Choe held numerous high-level government positions, including minister of metallurgical industry and minister of machine-building industry. </p><p>Choe's legacy in North Korea includes his contributions to the country's industrialization and his support for the development of the country's nuclear program. He also played a significant role in maintaining relations with the Soviet Union, which provided critical economic and military aid to North Korea during the Cold War. </p><p>In addition to his political endeavors, Choe was also a prolific writer, publishing several books on economics and technological innovation. His works were highly regarded in North Korea and continue to be studied and discussed by scholars and policymakers today.</p><p>Despite being a prominent figure in North Korean history, relatively little is known about Choe's personal life or family. His daughter, Choe Sun-ok, is a well-known composer in North Korea and has dedicated many of her works to her father's memory.</p><p>Choe Yong-gon received his education in Japan, where he studied at Waseda University in Tokyo. He was known for his expertise in economics and worked closely with Kim Il-sung on economic policies for decades. Choe was also involved in international diplomacy, representing North Korea at several international conferences and meetings. In 1953, he led the North Korean delegation to the Geneva Conference, which resulted in the armistice that ended the Korean War. </p><p>Despite his close affiliation with the ruling Korean Workers' Party, Choe was not immune to purges and was reportedly purged twice during his lifetime. The first purge occurred in 1958, when he was accused of holding revisionist views on economic policy. He was reinstated after Kim Il-sung intervened on his behalf, but the experience reportedly left him shaken. The second purge is believed to have taken place after his death, during a political crackdown that targeted senior officials deemed insufficiently loyal to the regime. </p><p>Choe Yong-gon's contributions to North Korea's industrialization and self-reliance policies continue to be celebrated in North Korean propaganda, which portrays him as a hero of the revolution. His legacy is also discussed in academic and policy circles, where his economic ideas are still debated and his role in the country's nuclear program is scrutinized. Despite his political setbacks, Choe's contributions to North Korea's development have secured his place in the country's official history as a revered figure.</p><p>Choe Yong-gon was also known for his close relationship with Kim Il-sung's son, Kim Jong-il. It is believed that Choe played a key role in grooming Kim Jong-il for leadership and helping to secure his position as the eventual successor to Kim Il-sung. Choe was reportedly one of the few senior officials whom Kim Jong-il trusted and sought advice from. Choe also served as a mentor to many young North Korean party officials and was known for his progressive, forward-looking vision for the country's economic and political future.</p><p>Despite being a loyal supporter of the Kim regime throughout his life, Choe was not afraid to speak his mind and offer criticism when he felt it was necessary. He was known for his independent thinking and willingness to challenge party orthodoxy, which made him a respected and influential figure among his peers. Choe's death in 1976 was widely mourned in North Korea, and he is still remembered as one of the country's greatest thinkers and leaders.</p><p>Choe Yong-gon's legacy also stretches beyond his political and economic contributions, as he was known for his passion for culture and the arts. He was an accomplished poet and calligrapher and was involved in promoting North Korean literature and art throughout his career. Choe was a patron of the country's artistic community and was known for his efforts to preserve North Korean cultural traditions. He also helped to establish several cultural organizations, including the Korean Art Association, which he served as chairman. Choe's support for the arts was rooted in his belief that they were an essential part of building a strong and prosperous society. He believed that artistic and cultural expression were crucial for inspiring people and fostering a sense of national pride. Today, Choe's legacy as a patron of the arts is commemorated through the Choe Yong-gon Literary Prize, which is awarded each year to North Korean writers in recognition of their contributions to the country's literary heritage.</p><p>In addition to his work in politics, economics, and the arts, Choe Yong-gon was also a proponent of environmentalism and conservation. He believed that preserving North Korea's natural resources was essential for the country's long-term economic and social well-being. Choe advocated for sustainable development practices and promoted the use of renewable energy sources such as hydropower. He was also involved in initiatives aimed at conserving North Korea's forests and protecting its wildlife. Choe's dedication to environmental protection was part of his larger vision for building a modern, prosperous, and sustainable North Korea. His ideas on environmentalism continue to influence policy discussions in North Korea today.</p><p></p><p>
