was
a North Korean
politician.


					</p><p>He served as the vice premier of North Korea from 1957 until his death in 1976. He was a trusted aide to founding leader Kim Il-sung and played a key role in the country's postwar economic development. In the 1960s, he advocated for the country's shift towards economic self-reliance and the development of heavy industry. He was also known for his work advocating for the reunification of North and South Korea. Despite his close ties to Kim Il-sung, he was reportedly purged in 1977, a year after his death, during a political crackdown.</p><p>Choe Yong-gon's involvement in politics began at a young age when he joined the Korean independence movement against Japanese rule in the 1920s. He was also a founding member of the Korean Workers' Party, which later became the ruling party in North Korea. Throughout his long career, Choe held numerous high-level government positions, including minister of metallurgical industry and minister of machine-building industry. </p><p>Choe's legacy in North Korea includes his contributions to the country's industrialization and his support for the development of the country's nuclear program. He also played a significant role in maintaining relations with the Soviet Union, which provided critical economic and military aid to North Korea during the Cold War. </p><p>In addition to his political endeavors, Choe was also a prolific writer, publishing several books on economics and technological innovation. His works were highly regarded in North Korea and continue to be studied and discussed by scholars and policymakers today.</p><p>Despite being a prominent figure in North Korean history, relatively little is known about Choe's personal life or family. His daughter, Choe Sun-ok, is a well-known composer in North Korea and has dedicated many of her works to her father's memory.</p><p></p><p>
