						</p><p>Jinnah is considered as the founder of Pakistan and is also known as Quaid-e-Azam (Great Leader). He played a crucial role in the movement for the independence of India and Pakistan from British rule. Jinnah was a prominent member of the Indian National Congress and was later the leader of the All India Muslim League. He was a proponent of the Two-Nation theory, which held that Hindus and Muslims were two separate nations with distinct interests and should have separate states.</p><p>During the 1940s, Jinnah led the demand for the creation of a separate Muslim state in the northern and northwestern regions of India. This demand eventually led to the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan in 1947. Jinnah became the first Governor-General of Pakistan and remained in the position until his death in 1948.</p><p>Jinnah was highly respected for his integrity, determination, and commitment to the cause of Pakistan. He is remembered as one of the most influential politicians in the history of Pakistan and India.</p><p>Jinnah was born in a wealthy merchant family in Karachi, which was then part of British India. He studied law in London and became a successful lawyer in Bombay (now Mumbai) before entering politics full-time. Jinnah's leadership and negotiating skills were considered instrumental in securing the "Pakistan Resolution" in 1940, which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims in India.</p><p>Jinnah's vision for Pakistan was of a secular state where all citizens, regardless of their religion, would be treated equally. He opposed the use of religion for political gain and believed in a democratic and pluralistic society. However, after his death, Pakistan witnessed several military coups and the rise of religious extremism, which deviated from Jinnah's vision.</p><p>Jinnah's personal life was less known publicly. He married Rattanbai Petit, a Parsi woman, against the wishes of her family, and they had one daughter. However, their marriage was short-lived as Rattanbai passed away from cancer at a young age.</p><p>Jinnah's legacy continues to be debated in Pakistan and India, with some seeing him as a secular and democratic leader, while others view him as a divisive figure who favored the interests of the Muslim minority over the rest of India. Regardless of one's perspective, Jinnah remains an influential figure in South Asian politics and history.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in lung cancer.
