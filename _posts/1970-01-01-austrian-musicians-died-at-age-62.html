(December 10, 1870		Brno-August 23, 1933			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
architect.


					</p><p>He is known for his pioneering work in modern architecture and is considered a key figure in the development of the International Style. Loos was deeply influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and sought to create buildings that were functional and efficient, while also focusing on the importance of interior design. He believed that ornamentation should be kept to a minimum and famously declared "ornament is crime" in his essay "Ornament and Crime." Loos designed a number of notable buildings in Vienna, including the iconic "Looshaus" on Michaelerplatz, as well as several private residences and commercial buildings. His work had a significant impact on the architectural landscape of Vienna and beyond, and he continues to be celebrated as one of Austria's most important architects.</p><p>Loos' design philosophy was grounded in the idea that architecture should be devoid of any unnecessary embellishments and instead, should embrace simplicity and functionality. In addition to his architectural work, Loos was also a prolific writer and lecturer. Over the course of his career, he wrote numerous essays and articles on architecture and design, which were compiled into a collection titled "Spoken into the Void." Loos also played a significant role in the development of modern interior design, creating minimalist, yet elegant spaces for his clients. Despite his influence on modern architecture, Loos faced criticism and controversy throughout his career, particularly for his rejection of traditional decorative elements. Nevertheless, his legacy continues to inspire architects and designers around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(February 20, 1844		Vienna-September 5, 1906			Duino)

	
		a.k.a. Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann

	
was
an Austrian
physicist, scientist and mathematician.


					</p><p>Boltzmann is known for his work in statistical mechanics, specifically the development of statistical thermodynamics. He made significant contributions to the understanding of heat and the relationship between temperature and entropy. Boltzmann's work on the kinetic theory of gases also helped to establish the foundation of modern physics. Despite initial resistance from the scientific community, his ideas eventually gained widespread acceptance and have become integral to our understanding of these concepts today. Boltzmann's contributions have been recognized with numerous honors and awards, including the prestigious Max Planck Medal. Unfortunately, he also struggled with depression and ultimately took his own life at the age of 62. In the years since his death, his work has continued to influence the field of physics and inspire scientists around the world.</p><p>Boltzmann studied at the University of Vienna where he obtained his doctorate in physics in 1866. He went on to teach at the universities of Graz, Vienna, and Munich. He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society of London and the Académie des Sciences in France. In addition to his groundbreaking work in physics, Boltzmann was also a philosopher who explored concepts related to the nature of time and causality. He believed that the Second Law of Thermodynamics was responsible for the concept of time's arrow, and that the universe was constantly evolving towards a state of maximum entropy. Boltzmann's ideas were instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics and influenced the work of many physicists who followed in his footsteps. Today, Boltzmann's legacy continues to be felt in the fields of physics, mathematics, and philosophy.</p><p></p><p>
