scientist, statistician, economist, physician and philosopher.


					</p><p>Petty was one of the founding members of the Royal Society in London and made significant contributions to the fields of economics and statistics. He is often considered the father of political arithmetic, which is the use of statistics and quantitative methods in politics and economics. Petty's work on economics focused on the concept of a "political arithmetic" that applied mathematical reasoning to the study of economic and social phenomena. His landmark work "A Treatise of Taxes and Contributions" is still studied today.</p><p>In addition to his work in economics, Petty was also a physician and served as a professor of anatomy at the University of Oxford. He conducted groundbreaking research on human anatomy, and was one of the first to propose that the body was composed of tiny building blocks called "cells."</p><p>Later in his life, Petty became involved in politics and served as a member of parliament for several years. He was also elevated to the peerage as the Earl of Shelburne in recognition of his contributions to science and politics.</p><p>As a philosopher, William Petty also made significant contributions to the development of empiricism, which is the idea that knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience. He believed that knowledge could be gained through observation and data analysis, which is reflected in his work on political arithmetic. </p><p>Petty's influence on economics continued long after his death, and his ideas were later developed by prominent economists, including Adam Smith and David Ricardo. His legacy in the field of medicine was also significant, and he made important contributions to the understanding of the human body that continue to inform medical research today.</p><p>Overall, William Petty was a polymath who made significant contributions to a wide range of fields. His work on economics, statistics, and anatomy helped to lay the foundation for many significant advancements in these areas, and his legacy continues to be felt today.</p><p></p><p>

(September 17, 1717-September 29, 1781)


was
a British
groom of the stool and diplomat.


					</p><p>Born in the Netherlands, William Nassau de Zuylestein inherited the title of Earl of Rochford from his mother. He began his career in politics as a Member of Parliament for the town of Callington in Cornwall. Later, he served as a Groom of the Bedchamber to King George II and King George III, a position that put him in close proximity to the monarchs and allowed him to exert significant influence. </p><p>In addition to his political duties, de Zuylestein was also a distinguished diplomat. He served as envoy to Portugal, Sweden, and Russia, and was well-regarded for his work in negotiating peace treaties during his time as ambassador. In 1763, he was appointed as Secretary of State for the Southern Department, a prestigious role in the British government that involved overseeing foreign affairs in Europe.</p><p>Despite his illustrious career, de Zuylestein is perhaps best known for his private life. He was a close friend of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, and is rumored to have had a romantic relationship with the prince. De Zuylestein was also a devoted patron of the arts and was known for his exquisite taste in architecture and design. Upon his death in 1781, he was succeeded by his nephew as Earl of Rochford.</p><p>During his diplomatic career, William Nassau de Zuylestein played a crucial role in several significant events of his time. As envoy to Portugal, he played an instrumental part in negotiating the Treaty of Lisbon in 1750, which resolved a long-standing territorial dispute between Portugal and Spain. His work in Sweden resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Hamburg in 1762, a key agreement that helped bring the Seven Years' War to an end. In Russia, he served as ambassador during a period of political upheaval, and played a central role in negotiating a treaty between Russia and Prussia.</p><p>Outside of his political and diplomatic work, de Zuylestein was also an avid collector of art and antiquities. He was particularly interested in classical antiquities and ancient Roman art. He amassed a large collection of sculpture, coins, and other objects during his lifetime, and served as a patron to several artists and architects. He was responsible for several notable architectural projects, including the refurbishment of the family home at Rochford Hall and the design of a new wing at St. James's Palace.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, William Nassau de Zuylestein's legacy is somewhat overshadowed by the rumors surrounding his private life. The nature of his relationship with Prince William has long been a matter of speculation, with some suggesting that the two men were lovers. While there is no hard evidence to support this claim, it is clear that the two men were extremely close and that de Zuylestein was one of the prince's most trusted confidants.</p><p></p><p>
