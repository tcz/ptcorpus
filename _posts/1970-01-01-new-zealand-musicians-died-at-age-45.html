					</p><p>He was a legendary motorcycle designer and manufacturer who founded the Britten Motorcycle Company. Britten was known for his innovative and unconventional designs, as well as his hands-on approach to building motorcycles. He began his career as a boatbuilder but soon turned his attention to motorcycles, building his first racing bike in the late 1970s. Britten went on to design and build a series of highly successful and unique motorcycles, many of which were raced with great success in international competitions. He was posthumously inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2006.</p><p>Britten's most well-known motorcycle design was the Britten V1000, which was famously built entirely by hand and featured a number of innovative design elements, including a carbon fiber frame and fuel tank. The V1000 was incredibly successful on the racing circuit, winning numerous races and setting multiple world records. In addition to his work as a motorcycle designer and builder, Britten was also an accomplished musician and artist, and often incorporated his other creative pursuits into his motorcycle designs. Despite battling cancer for much of his career, Britten continued to innovate and push the boundaries of motorcycle design until his untimely death at the age of 45.</p><p>Britten's contributions to the world of motorcycle design have been widely recognized and celebrated. In addition to his induction into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame, he was also posthumously awarded the New Zealand Order of Merit in 1995, and the award for the Most Outstanding Contribution to Motorsport at the 1995 New Zealand Motorsport Awards. The Britten Motorcycle Company, which was established in 1992, continues to produce limited-edition motorcycles based on Britten's original designs, and his legacy as a designer, innovator, and artist has inspired countless others to pursue their own creative passions.</p><p>Britten's love for motorcycles began when he saw a Honda CB72 in a showroom in 1965. He acquired the bike four years later and started racing it. This sparked a passion for speed and an interest in motorcycle engineering. He built his first motorcycle in the late 1970s and went on to develop his expertise in motorcycle design and engineering by attending courses in mechanical engineering and undertaking various jobs related to the field. </p><p>In 1985, Britten embarked on a project to build a racing motorcycle that would challenge the status quo. He wanted to create a motorcycle that was incredibly lightweight, fast, and durable. The result of his efforts was the Britten V1000, which was first entered into competition in 1990. This stunning motorcycle won many races all over the world and set several records along the way.</p><p>Britten was also a pioneer in the use of composite materials in motorcycle engineering. He used carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) extensively in the V1000, making it a lightweight and incredibly strong motorcycle.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to the world of motorcycle engineering, Britten's legacy also includes his philanthropic efforts. He donated his time and money to various organizations promoting environmental conservation, healthcare, and education. He also left a significant endowment to the University of Canterbury to fund research in engineering and technology.</p><p>Britten passed away in 1995 at the age of 45 from cancer. However, his legacy lives on, and his impact on the world of motorcycle engineering and beyond continues to inspire generations of designers, engineers, and makers.</p><p></p><p>
