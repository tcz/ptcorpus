(January 2, 1885		Billingford-March 31, 1918			Moreuil)


was
a Canadian
soldier.


					</p><p>Gordon Flowerdew was a skilled horseman who joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force at the outbreak of World War I. He quickly rose through the ranks and was eventually promoted to Captain, serving as the commanding officer of the Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) during the Battle of Moreuil Wood in 1918. </p><p>During the battle, Flowerdew led a charge against entrenched German machine gun positions, sustaining heavy casualties but ultimately routing the enemy's defenses. For his bravery, he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest honor for military valor in the British Empire. </p><p>Flowerdew's legacy lives on through the Gordon Flowerdew Trophy, awarded annually to the winner of the Manitoba Horse Trials, as well as through various monuments and memorials dedicated to his memory.</p><p>Flowerdew was born into a prominent English family and was educated at Eton College. However, he decided to immigrate to Canada in 1902 at the age of 17, seeking adventure and opportunities to prove himself as a horseman. He first worked as a ranch hand in Alberta, then later became a member of the Royal North-West Mounted Police. In 1910, he married Lady Adeline Mary Chaplin, a daughter of the 5th Earl of Chaplin, and they had two children together.</p><p>At the outbreak of World War I, Flowerdew enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force and was eventually assigned to the Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), a cavalry regiment that had a long history of service in Canada and overseas. Flowerdew proved to be an outstanding soldier and leader, earning a reputation for fearlessness and determination in battle.</p><p>The Battle of Moreuil Wood on March 30, 1918, was one of the defining moments of Flowerdew's military career. The German army had launched a major offensive in the spring of 1918, and the Canadian Corps was sent to the front lines to help stop their advance. Flowerdew's unit was ordered to charge a heavily defended position held by German machine gunners near the town of Moreuil. Against all odds, Flowerdew led his men on a daring charge through a hail of bullets and artillery fire, using his sword to cut down enemy gunners and inspire his men to follow. Despite suffering severe injuries, Flowerdew continued to fight until he was finally overwhelmed by the German forces. He died the next day in a field hospital.</p><p>Flowerdew's heroism and sacrifice were widely praised in Canada and Britain, and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest honor for military valor in the British Empire. His wife Adeline accepted the award on behalf of her late husband, and his citation read:</p><p>"For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty when in command of a squadron detailed for special work, he himself led the unit in a charge through a very heavy curtain of fire which was holding up the advance. The enemy's machine guns were dealt with, and the line was captured. Later, when the enemy became very active and subsequently outnumbered our men, this officer, knowing the risk attached to the move and realizing the importance of holding onto the position at all costs, led a second successful charge. His courage and dash in the face of heavy fire inspired the greatest confidence in his men, particularly when he led them in the capture of so important an objective."</p><p>Flowerdew's legacy as a brave and selfless soldier has been honored in many ways. In addition to the Gordon Flowerdew Trophy, his name appears on several memorials and plaques, including a monument in Moreuil and a plaque at the Vimy Memorial in France. His story has also been told in several books, including "The Great War as I Saw It" by Captain George Pearson, one of his fellow officers.</p><p>After his death, Gordon Flowerdew's remains were laid to rest at the Moreuil British Cemetery, and his name was inscribed on the Vimy Memorial. In addition to his posthumous Victoria Cross, he was also awarded the Croix de Guerre with Palm by the French government. Flowerdew's bravery and leadership during the Battle of Moreuil Wood continues to inspire generations of Canadian soldiers and is celebrated as a defining moment in Canadian military history. His legacy has been further memorialized in a portrait by renowned Canadian artist, Alfred Joseph Casson, which hangs in the National War Memorial in Ottawa. Additionally, a road and a park in Vancouver, where Flowerdew lived before enlisting in the army, have been named after him as a tribute to his sacrifice and service.</p><p></p><p>
