									</h1><p>Here are 2 famous musicians from Algeria died at 46:</p><h2>Jean Sénac</h2><p><strong>Jean Sénac</strong>
(November 29, 1926		Béni Saf-August 30, 1973			Algiers)


was
an Algerian
poet and author.


					</p><p>Sénac was a major figure in the Algerian literary scene and played a crucial role in promoting the country’s culture and identity through his works. He was an outspoken advocate of cultural pluralism and a staunch defender of the Berber language and culture, which he championed throughout his life. Sénac was also a political activist and was involved in the struggle for Algerian independence, working closely with the National Liberation Front (FLN). However, he was later persecuted and assassinated by members of the Algerian government due to his homosexuality and his outspoken criticism of the government's policies. Despite his tragic end, Sénac's legacy continues to inspire writers and intellectuals in Algeria and beyond.</p><p>Sénac was born to a French mother and an Algerian father in Béni Saf, Algeria. It was in Algeria where he spent most of his life and where he published most of his works, which included poetry, essays, and plays. He was known for his use of the French language to express Arabic and Berber themes and motifs.</p><p>His work focused heavily on the themes of identity, culture, and language, and his passion for these subjects made him a leading figure in the cultural and intellectual life of Algeria. In 1962, following Algeria's independence from France, Sénac founded and became the director of the Maison de la Culture in Algiers, which played a crucial role in promoting Algerian culture and literature.</p><p>Sénac's legacy also includes his activism for LGBTQ+ rights, which he saw tied up with his broader cultural and political convictions. He wrote openly about his sexuality and advocated for the acceptance of gay and lesbian people in Algerian society. This outspokenness, along with his opposition to what he saw as the government's increasingly authoritarian turn, likely contributed to his assassination.</p><p>Despite the controversy and tragedy surrounding his life and death, Sénac's work and activism continue to be celebrated in Algeria and beyond. In 2005, the Algerian government established a national award in his honor, the Prix Jean Sénac, which is given annually to recognize achievements in poetry and literature.</p><p></p><p>

(August 23, 1932		Héliopolis, Algeria-December 27, 1978			Algiers)

	
		otherwise known as Houari Boumedienne

	
was
an Algerian
politician.


					</p><p>He served as the second President of Algeria from 1965 until his death in 1978. Boumediene was a major figure in the Algerian War of Independence, which ended in 1962, and he played a key role in Algeria's transition from a French colony to an independent nation. During his presidency, Boumediene implemented many socialist policies and nationalized many industries, including oil and gas production. He also strengthened ties with other socialist countries, particularly the Soviet Union, and played a key role in establishing the Organization of African Unity. In addition to his political career, Boumediene was also a military commander, having served as the Chief of Staff of the Algerian National Liberation Army during the war for independence.</p><p>Boumediene's presidency saw significant economic growth and development, with increased investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare. He also focused on land reforms and agrarian reforms to improve the lives of Algeria's rural population. However, his regime was criticized for its authoritarianism and the suppression of political dissent. Boumediene's government also faced several challenges, including the rise of Islamist movements and a brief border war with Morocco in 1975. Despite his extensive contributions to Algerian independence and development, Boumediene's sudden death in 1978 was met with controversy and rumors of foul play. Today, he remains a prominent figure in Algerian history and politics.</p><p></p><p>
