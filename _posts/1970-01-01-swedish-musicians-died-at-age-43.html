(December 1, 1751		Floby-April 20, 1795			Stockholm)


was
a Swedish
writer.


					</p><p>Kellgren is considered to be one of the most influential literary figures of the late 18th century in Sweden. He wrote in various genres, including poetry, drama, and prose, and his works often reflected the cultural and societal changes taking place in Sweden at the time. </p><p>Kellgren was also an editor and translator, and he played a role in spreading Enlightenment ideas throughout Sweden. He was known for his wit and his ability to write in a clear and accessible style that appealed to a wide audience. </p><p>Despite his successes, Kellgren struggled with personal and financial difficulties throughout his life. He suffered from poor health, and his literary ambitions often left him in debt. Nevertheless, he remained a prominent figure in Swedish literature and continues to be celebrated for his contributions to the field.</p><p>Kellgren began his literary career in Gothenburg, where he worked as a tutor and began publishing his first poems. In 1773, he moved to Stockholm and quickly established himself as a leading figure in the city's literary scene. He became a member of the Swedish Academy in 1786 and was appointed as the academy's permanent secretary in 1787. </p><p>Kellgren was also involved in the theatre and wrote several plays, including the popular work "Den Svenska Sprätthöken" (The Swedish Prankster), which he wrote in collaboration with Carl Envallsson. His poetry often tackled social and political issues, and his most famous work, "Mina löjen" (My Laughter), is a satirical poem that pokes fun at the hypocrisy and corruption of Swedish society. </p><p>In addition to his literary pursuits, Kellgren was also a prominent figure in the cultural and intellectual life of Stockholm. He founded several literary societies and was a close friend of King Gustav III, who was a patron of the arts. Kellgren's legacy continued long after his death, and he remains an important figure in Swedish literature, with his works continuing to be studied and admired by scholars and readers alike.</p><p>Kellgren's influence on Swedish literature is still felt today, both in the style and subject matter of his writing and in his contributions to the development of the Swedish language. He was an advocate for the use of Swedish rather than Latin in literary and academic settings, and his work helped to establish Swedish as a language that was capable of expressing complex ideas and emotions. Kellgren's interest in language also led him to translate several works from other languages into Swedish, including Shakespeare's "Hamlet" and Voltaire's "Candide". </p><p>Despite his success, Kellgren was not without his critics. Some of his contemporaries accused him of being too superficial and lacking in depth, and his reliance on satire and wit was sometimes seen as being at odds with the serious issues he addressed in his writing. Nevertheless, Kellgren's impact on Swedish literature cannot be overstated, and his work continues to be widely read and studied today.</p><p>In addition to his literary and cultural work, Kellgren was also involved in politics. He was a supporter of King Gustav III's efforts to strengthen the power of the monarchy in Sweden and his advocacy for Enlightenment ideas. Kellgren's political views were reflected in his writing, particularly in his satirical works, which often targeted those who opposed the king's reforms. Kellgren's support for the monarchy and Enlightenment ideals was not without controversy, and his views sometimes placed him at odds with other writers and intellectuals in Sweden.</p><p>Kellgren's influence extended beyond the literary and political spheres. He was also a key figure in the development of Swedish theater, and his plays were popular and widely produced during his lifetime. Additionally, Kellgren was known for his role in popularizing the opera in Sweden, and he worked closely with the composer Johann Gottlieb Naumann to introduce new operas to Swedish audiences.</p><p>Despite his early success and achievements, Kellgren's health declined in the final years of his life, and he struggled with financial difficulties and personal setbacks. He died at the age of 43, leaving behind a legacy that continues to be celebrated in Sweden and around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(December 9, 1742		Stralsund, Pomerania-May 21, 1786			Köping)

	
		also known as Karl Wilhelm Scheele

	
was
a Swedish
chemist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his discovery of several important chemical elements including oxygen, chlorine, tungsten and molybdenum. Scheele was also responsible for the discovery of numerous organic compounds, including citric acid and glycerol. He was one of the foremost chemists of the 18th century and his work laid the foundations for the modern understanding of chemistry. Despite his numerous contributions to the field of chemistry, Scheele did not receive the recognition he deserved during his lifetime and his work was overshadowed by that of his contemporaries. However, his work is now widely acknowledged as being of great significance and he is considered to be one of the most important figures in the history of chemistry.</p><p>Scheele began his career as a pharmacist's apprentice, but his keen interest in chemistry led him to conduct experiments in his free time. He eventually opened his own pharmacy and laboratory, where he carried out much of his research. In addition to his discoveries of new elements and compounds, Scheele also developed new techniques for analyzing and synthesizing chemicals. His work had a profound impact on the fields of medicine, agriculture, and industry.</p><p>Despite his groundbreaking achievements, Scheele struggled financially for much of his life. He was not a skilled businessman, and his pharmacy struggled to make ends meet.

His education was cut short when he was forced to leave school to help support his family, but he continued to learn on his own and through his work in the pharmacy.</p><p>Scheele's discoveries, though significant, were often overshadowed by the work of his contemporaries, such as Antoine Lavoisier and Joseph Priestley. Some historians believe that Scheele's lack of recognition during his lifetime may have been due, in part, to his humble and unassuming personality. He was not one to promote himself or his work, and he often shared his findings with others without seeking credit or recognition.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced, Scheele's legacy in the field of chemistry remains undeniable. His work laid the foundation for many of the scientific advancements that would follow, and his discoveries continue to be studied and celebrated today.
