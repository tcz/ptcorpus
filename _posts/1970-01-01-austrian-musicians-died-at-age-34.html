(January 29, 1903-September 1, 1937)


was
an Austrian
writer.


					</p><p>He was born in Vienna, Austria and studied law and philosophy at the University of Vienna. However, he soon developed an interest in writing and began publishing his work in various newspapers and literary journals. Landau's most famous work is the novel "The Evil Eye," which was published in 1929 and explores the nature of guilt and personal responsibility. He also published several collections of short stories and essays during his brief career.</p><p>Landau was politically active and involved in anti-fascist and anti-Nazi activities. He was arrested several times for his political views and was eventually forced to flee Austria in 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi party. He settled in Paris, where he continued to write and work with other Austrian exiles.</p><p>Tragically, Landau's promising career was cut short when he died of tuberculosis in 1937 at the young age of 34. Despite his short career, he is remembered as an important figure in Austrian literature and as a courageous anti-fascist activist who risked his life to resist Nazi oppression.</p><p>Landau was one of the founders of the Austrian Communist Party and was actively involved in socialist politics. He also traveled extensively, visiting Russia and the United States, where he gave lectures on Austrian literature and culture. Landau's writing was known for its psychological depth and sensitive portrayal of complex human emotions. He wrote about themes such as love, death, and personal identity, always with a deeply humanistic perspective. Even today, his works continue to be read and appreciated by readers around the world. In 1993, the Austrian government posthumously awarded him the Decoration of Merit in Gold for services to the country's literature and culture.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Kurt Landau's work continues to be studied and recognized as significant in Austrian literature. His book "The Evil Eye" remains a classic and is widely read in both German and English translations. One of his stories, "The Stowaway," is particularly well-known for its nuanced portrayal of a Jewish refugee trying to escape Nazi persecution in Austria. Landau's political activism also left a lasting impact on Austrian history. He was part of a generation of progressive intellectuals who fought against fascism and totalitarianism, and his commitment to anti-fascist resistance serves as an inspiration for activists today. Landau's literary and political legacy continue to be celebrated in Austria, and his life and work remain a testament to the power of art and ideas in the face of great adversity.</p><p></p><p>

(September 5, 1878		Vienna-February 20, 1913			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
physicist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his invention of the first practical electronic amplifier, the vacuum-tube amplifier, in 1906. This invention revolutionized the fields of electronics and telecommunications, as it allowed for the amplification of electrical signals over long distances without significant degradation. Lieben also made significant contributions to the development of the cathode ray tube and the wireless transmission of information. Despite his promising career, Lieben died at the young age of 34 from tuberculosis. Nevertheless, his inventions and discoveries continue to influence modern technology and remain crucial to many electronic devices used today.</p><p>Lieben grew up in Vienna and showed an early interest in science and electrical engineering. He attended the Technical University in Vienna, where he received his degree in electrical engineering in 1900. He then worked for the Vienna Siemens-Schuckert Works, where he conducted research in gas discharge phenomena and the properties of cathode rays.</p><p>In 1902, Lieben moved to Berlin to work with the physicist Emil Warburg at the University of Berlin. It was there that he began his work on the vacuum-tube amplifier, which would become his most significant invention. In 1906, Lieben successfully demonstrated the first practical amplifier, which utilized the electrical properties of a vacuum-tube to amplify signals.</p><p>Lieben's invention was groundbreaking, as it allowed for the amplification of electrical signals over long distances with minimal degradation. This made long-distance communication much more feasible and paved the way for the development of radio and television broadcasting, as well as modern telecommunications.</p><p>Despite his significant contributions to science and technology, Lieben's life was cut short by tuberculosis. He died in Vienna in 1913 at the young age of 34. Nevertheless, his legacy lives on, and his work continues to be crucial to many electronic devices used in modern society.</p><p>After Lieben's death, his work on the vacuum-tube amplifier was further developed by other scientists, leading to the creation of the triode, which became a crucial component in radio technology. The triode was used extensively during World War I for radio communication and was later crucial to the development of television broadcasting.</p><p>Lieben's contributions to science and technology were not only limited to the vacuum-tube amplifier. He also made significant contributions to the development of the cathode ray tube, which is still used today in televisions and computer monitors.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Lieben was known for his philanthropic endeavors. He devoted a portion of his income to the support of disadvantaged youth and established a foundation in his name that still exists today.</p><p>In recognition of his achievements, Lieben has been honored with numerous accolades, including the Siemens-Ring, one of the most prestigious awards in the field of electrical engineering. Today, Lieben is remembered as a pioneer in the field of electronics and telecommunications who revolutionized long-distance communication and paved the way for many of the modern devices and technologies we rely on today.</p><p></p><p>
