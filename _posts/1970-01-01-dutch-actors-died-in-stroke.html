							Johannes Heesters had a remarkable career that spanned over eight decades, making him one of the longest-working performers in history. He began his career as an actor in Germany in the 1920s and went on to become one of the country's most popular musical stars of the 1930s and 1940s. During this time, he appeared in several films, including "Das Hofkonzert" ("The Court Concert"), "Wasser für Canitoga" ("Water for Canitoga"), and "Hochzeitsnacht im Paradies" ("Wedding Night in Paradise").</p><p>Heesters' popularity in Germany continued after World War II, but his performances in Nazi propaganda films during the war made him a controversial figure in later years. He rejected allegations that he was a Nazi sympathizer, stating that he only performed to entertain the troops and that he never supported Hitler or the Nazi party. Despite the controversy, Heesters remained active in the music and entertainment industry until his death in 2011, performing in theaters and on television into his 100s. His career was celebrated in a documentary film titled "Heesters - Ein Leben für die Bühne" ("Heesters - A Life for the Stage") in 2011.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=356058" title="Wikipedia article about Johannes Heesters">Johannes Heesters on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/british-actors-died-in-diabetes-mellitus.html' title='British actors died in Diabetes mellitus'><strong>British actors died in Diabetes mellitus</strong> List of the top 3 British actors who died in Diabetes mellitus</a></li><li><a href='/australian-actors-died-at-age-40.html' title='Australian actors died at age 40'><strong>Australian actors died at age 40</strong> List of the top 2 Australian actors who died when they were 40</a></li><li><a href='/brazilian-actors-died-in-1984.html' title='Brazilian actors died in 1984'><strong>Brazilian actors died in 1984</strong> List of the top 1 Brazilian actors who died in 1984</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/indian-actresses-died-before-turning-25.html' title='Indian actresses died before turning 25'><strong>Indian actresses died before turning 25</strong> List of the top 8 Indian actresses who died before they turned 25</a></li><li><a href='/english-actors-died-in-barbiturate.html' title='English actors died in Barbiturate'><strong>English actors died in Barbiturate</strong> List of the top 1 English actors who died in Barbiturate</a></li><li><a href='/egyptian-actresses-died-in-1961.html' title='Egyptian actresses died in 1961'><strong>Egyptian actresses died in 1961</strong> List of the top 1 Egyptian actresses who died in 1961</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
