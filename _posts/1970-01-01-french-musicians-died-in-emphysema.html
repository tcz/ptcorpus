						Georges Moustaki was born in Egypt to parents who were Greek Jews. His family moved to Greece when he was a young child, and he later immigrated to France in the 1950s. He worked as a songwriter and composer for other artists before gaining fame as a performer in his own right in the late 1960s. Moustaki was known for his distinctive voice, poetic lyrics, and innovative compositions, which combined elements of French chanson, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern music, and jazz. He was a prolific artist who released over 30 albums throughout his career. In addition to his music, Moustaki also wrote poetry, was a political activist, and appeared in films and television shows. He was awarded the French Legion of Honour in 2011 for his cultural contributions.
