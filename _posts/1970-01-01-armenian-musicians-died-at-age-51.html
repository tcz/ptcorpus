He was a founding member and chairman of the "Mkhitar Sebastatsi" Educational Center, a non-governmental organization established in 1986 that advocates for innovation in education and the promotion of Armenian culture. The center has since become a leading force in educational reform in Armenia, and is recognized as an important contributor to the country's social and cultural development.

					</p><p>Mirzoyan was a key figure in the Bolshevik movement in Azerbaijan and Armenia. He was a member of the Social Democratic Party and later joined the Russian Communist Party.

He also played an important role in the establishment of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1920. During his political career, Mirzoyan held several high-level positions in the Soviet government, including the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Armenian SSR. In 1937, Mirzoyan was arrested during the Great Purge, a campaign of political repression in the Soviet Union. He was tried and convicted of treason and subsequently executed in 1939.</p><p>Mirzoyan's contributions to the Soviet government were not limited to political leadership. He was also known for his literary work, including poems and articles on politics and social issues. Mirzoyan was well-educated, attending universities in both Russia and Switzerland, and was fluent in several languages. In addition to his political activism and writing, Mirzoyan was a devoted family man and had four children with his wife Mariam. Despite his controversial execution, Mirzoyan's legacy as a key figure in the establishment of the Soviet Union and the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic continues to be studied and debated.</p><p>Mirzoyan was born into a family of Armenian intelligentsia in the Elisabethpol Governorate, which is now part of Azerbaijan. He received his early education in a local school before moving to Russia to study law at Moscow State University.

He played a significant role in helping to establish Soviet power in Azerbaijan and was a member of the Baku Commune, which was the first government in the world to be led by Communists.</p><p>In 1920, Mirzoyan was sent to Armenia to lead the Sovietization of the country. He played a critical role in establishing Soviet power in Armenia, and in 1922, he was appointed the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Armenian SSR, which was the highest position in the government of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.</p><p>Mirzoyan's legacy as a political leader and writer has been the subject of much debate in Armenia and beyond. Some see him as a dedicated Bolshevik who played a key role in establishing the Soviet Union and bringing socialism to Armenia, while others view him as a traitor who betrayed his homeland by serving the Soviet regime.</p><p>Regardless of one's opinion of Mirzoyan, there is no denying his impact on Armenian and Soviet history. He was a dedicated revolutionary and believed in the power of communism to create a better society. As a writer, he used his talents to spread the message of the Bolsheviks and advocate for social change. Mirzoyan's arrest and execution during the Great Purge were a tragic end to a storied political career, but his contributions to Armenia and the Soviet Union cannot be overlooked. Today, he is remembered as a complex figure whose life and legacy continue to be studied by scholars and historians.</p><p></p><p>
