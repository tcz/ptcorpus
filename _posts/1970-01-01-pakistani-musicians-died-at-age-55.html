was
a Pakistani
politician.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Kamal.

						</p><p>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is widely known as the "Father of the Nation" in Bangladesh, as he is credited with leading East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) to independence from Pakistan. He was the founding leader of the Awami League, which emerged as the largest political party in East Pakistan during the 1960s. </p><p>Rahman was a charismatic leader and a staunch advocate for self-determination for the Bengali people. He played a leading role in the Language Movement of 1952, which aimed to establish Bengali as the official language of East Pakistan. He was also instrumental in the formation of the six-point demand, a set of political demands that called for greater autonomy and self-rule for East Pakistan.</p><p>In 1971, East Pakistan declared its independence from Pakistan, leading to a brutal and bloody conflict that lasted for nine months. Rahman was jailed by the Pakistani authorities for his role in the independence movement, but he was released in 1972 after the war ended and Bangladesh gained its independence.</p><p>As the first President of Bangladesh, Rahman faced a daunting task of rebuilding a shattered country. He focused on rebuilding the economy and infrastructure, and his administration made significant progress in areas such as education and healthcare. However, his efforts were hampered by continuing political unrest, and his government was accused of corruption and authoritarianism.</p><p>On August 15, 1975, Rahman and most of his family were assassinated by a group of army officers in a coup d'Ã©tat. Despite his controversial legacy, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remains a revered figure in Bangladesh and his contributions to the country's independence are widely recognized.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of assassination.
