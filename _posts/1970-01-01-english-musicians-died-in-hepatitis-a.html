		also known as Frederick John Inman or Inman, John

	
was
an English
actor.


					</p><p>He was best known for his role as Mr. Humphries in the British sitcom "Are You Being Served?" which ran from 1972-1985. Inman's portrayal of Mr. Humphries, a camp and flamboyant menswear salesman, made him a beloved figure in British television history. Inman began his acting career in the 1960s and made appearances in several television shows and films before his iconic role in "Are You Being Served?" He was also a talented stage actor, appearing in numerous productions in London's West End. Inman never publicly came out as gay during his lifetime but was known to be a trailblazer in portraying gay characters on television at a time when it was still taboo. He passed away in 2007 at the age of 71 after suffering from Hepatitis A.</p><p>Inman had a difficult childhood and was sent to live with an aunt in Blackpool after his parents separated. He left school at the age of 13 and worked various jobs, including as a window dresser and a hotel porter, before pursuing a career in acting. In addition to his work on television and stage, Inman was also a talented singer and released several singles in the 1970s, including a cover of the Doris Day song "I Enjoy Being a Girl." Inman was a private person and little is known about his personal life, although he was known to have had a long-term partner, Ron Lynch, who died in 2002. Despite being a popular figure in British television, Inman's career suffered in the 1980s due to the changing attitudes towards representations of homosexuality on screen. However, he continued to work in theatre, including a successful production of "Aladdin" in which he played Widow Twankey. Inman's legacy as an iconic figure in British television history has endured, with his character Mr. Humphries becoming a symbol of LGBTQ+ representation and visibility.</p><p>Inman's contributions to LGBTQ+ representation on television were recognized posthumously when he was awarded the "British Comedy Awards Lifetime Achievement Award" in 2007. In addition to "Are You Being Served?", Inman also appeared in other television shows, such as "Doctor Who" and "The Dick Emery Show," as well as several films, including "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" and "Alice in Wonderland." Despite facing some criticism for his portrayal of Mr. Humphries as a caricatured, stereotypical gay character, Inman defended his performance, stating that his intention was to make people laugh and not to offend anyone. Inman's legacy continues to inspire future generations of LGBTQ+ actors and performers, who see him as a trailblazer and a role model.</p><p></p><p>
