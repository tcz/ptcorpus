He was a vocal supporter of the resistance movement during World War II and used his platform to speak out against the Nazi occupation of Denmark. In recognition of his bravery and dedication, he was awarded the Cross of Honour of the Resistance in 1947.</p><p>Despite his numerous achievements, Schønberg was known for his humility and modesty.
