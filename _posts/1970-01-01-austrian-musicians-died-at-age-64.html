(February 27, 1861		Donji Kraljevec-March 30, 1925			Dornach)


was
an Austrian
philosopher, architect and scientist.


					</p><p>He is best known as the founder of anthroposophy, a spiritual philosophy that he believed could serve as a bridge between science and spirituality. Steiner is also noted for his work in education, agriculture, and medicine, and he gave over 6,000 lectures during his lifetime on a wide range of topics. He was instrumental in the development of biodynamic agriculture, which emphasizes the spiritual forces in nature, and his ideas about alternative medicine continue to influence alternative healing practices today. Additionally, Steiner's architectural designs display his belief in the interrelationship between the built environment and the spiritual life of individuals.</p><p>Steiner was born in what is now Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and grew up in Vienna. He showed a keen interest in literature, philosophy and science from a young age, and went on to study at the Vienna Institute of Technology. After completing his studies, he worked as a private tutor and wrote a number of books on philosophy and education.</p><p>In his mid-thirties, Steiner became involved with Theosophy, a spiritual movement that stressed the idea of spiritual evolution and the unity of all religions. He eventually split from the Theosophical Society and, in 1913, founded his own organization, the Anthroposophical Society. Through the Society, Steiner sought to promote his ideas about spiritual development and a holistic approach to education, healthcare and farming.</p><p>Despite facing opposition from some quarters, Steiner's ideas attracted a significant following, and today the Anthroposophical Society has members in over 50 countries. Steiner's legacy is also evident in the Waldorf education system, which follows his holistic philosophy of education, and in the continued popularity of biodynamic farming and alternative medicine.</p><p>Steiner's interests and accomplishments were diverse, and his contributions extended beyond philosophy and education. He also had a strong interest in music, particularly in the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and composed over 80 pieces of music himself. Furthermore, he was a prolific author, having written numerous books on a wide range of topics, including philosophy, spirituality, science, education, and agriculture. Some of his notable works include "The Philosophy of Freedom," "An Outline of Esoteric Science," and "How to Know Higher Worlds." </p><p>In addition to his intellectual pursuits, Steiner was also an accomplished architect, having designed several buildings that reflect his philosophy of anthroposophy. One of his notable works is the Goetheanum, a cultural center located in Dornach, Switzerland, which serves as a hub for anthroposophical activities and events.</p><p>Steiner's life and work continue to inspire and influence people around the world, with his ideas and teachings serving as a foundation for many alternative and holistic practices today. His legacy is celebrated through various initiatives and institutions that promote the values he espoused, such as the Rudolf Steiner Archive and the Rudolf Steiner Foundation.</p><p></p><p>

(January 19, 1868		Vienna-December 4, 1932			Starnberg)

	
		a.k.a. Gustavus Meyrinck, Meyrink, Gustav or Gustav Meyer

	
was
an Austrian
writer.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Sybil Felizata Meyrink and Harro Fortunat Meyrink.

						</p><p>Meyrink was best known for his novels and stories which often had a supernatural or mystical aspect to them. He was heavily influenced by the works of the occultist and philosopher Rudolf Steiner, and also explored themes such as theosophy, alchemy, and the Kabbalah in his writing. One of his most famous works is the novel "The Golem", which is considered a classic of horror and fantasy literature. Meyrink was also involved in the occult and esoteric scene in Vienna, and was a member of several secret societies, including the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Despite his success as a writer, Meyrink struggled with financial difficulties throughout his life and at times had to support himself through less glamorous means, such as working as a translator or selling secondhand books. Nevertheless, his literary legacy continues to inspire and captivate readers to this day.</p><p>Meyrink's interest in mysticism and the occult were not limited to his writing, as he was also known to have practiced various forms of magic and spiritualism. He claimed to have had mystical experiences, including encounters with ghosts and spiritual beings. These experiences were said to have greatly influenced his writing, and he often drew from his own encounters with the supernatural when creating his stories. In addition to "The Golem", he also wrote several other notable works, including "The Green Face" and "Walpurgis Night". </p><p>Meyrink's life was not without its share of tragedy. His wife, Philomena, died in 1912, leaving him to raise their two young children on his own. Later in life, Meyrink also suffered from a variety of health issues, including heart problems and tuberculosis. He eventually passed away in 1932 at the age of 64. Despite these challenges, he remained devoted to his writing and continued to produce works that have had a lasting impact on readers around the world. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important writers of the supernatural and mystical in the early 20th century.</p><p>Meyrink also had an interesting career before he became a full-time writer. He studied engineering and architecture, and worked as a banker and stockbroker for several years. However, he was not content with this career path and soon turned to writing, which had been a lifelong passion of his. His first published work was a collection of short stories called "The Hot Soldier and Other Stories", which was released in 1896 under the pseudonym Gustavus Meyrinck. It was not until the publication of "The Golem" in 1915 that Meyrink gained widespread recognition and acclaim as a writer. In addition to his writing and occult interests, Meyrink was also a supporter of anarchism and was involved in political activism throughout his life. He was a vocal critic of the Austrian monarchy and advocated for a more egalitarian society. Despite his political views, however, Meyrink remained largely apolitical in his writing and focused primarily on mystical and supernatural themes.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Hermann J. Broch

	
was
an Austrian
writer.


					</p><p>Broch was born into a prosperous Jewish family in Vienna, Austria. He received a degree in mechanical engineering from the Vienna University of Technology, but later turned to literature and began writing novels and essays. His literary style is marked by a mix of modernist and existentialist themes. </p><p>Broch's most notable works include "The Sleepwalkers", a trilogy of novels published between 1928 and 1932 that explored the decline of Western culture and the rise of the Nazi regime. His other works include "The Death of Virgil", a novel about the final hours of the Roman poet, and "The Guiltless", a novel set in pre-World War I Vienna. </p><p>During World War II, Broch was imprisoned by the Nazi regime for his anti-fascist beliefs. After his release, he emigrated to the United States and eventually settled in New Haven, Connecticut. He continued to write and lecture until his death in 1951. </p><p>Today, Broch is considered one of the most important writers of the early 20th century, and his work continues to inspire and influence writers and thinkers around the world.</p><p>In addition to his literary career, Hermann Broch was also involved in political and social activism. He was a vocal opponent of fascism and nationalism, and actively worked to promote pacifism and internationalism. Broch was a member of a number of leftist organizations, including the Austrian Revolutionary Socialists and the Austrian Association for Free Thought. He also contributed to various socialist and pacifist publications, using his writing to promote his political and social convictions. Broch's views on politics and society are reflected in his literary works, which often explore the meaning and consequences of totalitarianism, war, and social upheaval. Despite his contributions to literature and politics, Broch remains relatively unknown outside of academic and literary circles, and his works are often overshadowed by those of his contemporaries such as Franz Kafka and Thomas Mann.</p><p>Broch's interest in literature started during his twenties, during which he wrote poetry and studied the works of Goethe and Rilke. His first publication, "Two Songs," appeared in a Viennese newspaper in 1912. The following year, he met the philosopher and cultural critic, Ludwig Wittgenstein, who had a profound influence on Broch's philosophical and literary outlook. However, it was not until his forties that Broch gained critical acclaim for his literary work. </p><p>Aside from his political and literary work, Hermann Broch was also an avid reader of philosophy and a proponent of existentialism. He was particularly interested in the work of Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre, and his own writing is marked by a philosophical depth and complexity. Broch's novels reflect his fascination with exploring the paradoxes of human existence and the impact of historical and social change on individual experience.</p><p>The legacy of Hermann Broch's writings has endured well beyond his lifetime. His oeuvre has been the subject of innumerable studies and critical interpretations, and continues to be widely read and analyzed. His contributions to Austrian literature and culture, as well as his political and philosophical insights, have cemented his place as one of the most important figures of 20th-century literature.</p><p></p><p>

After the war, he worked for a variety of avant-garde magazines and became known for his controversial and politically charged work. In 1923, he published his first book of plays, "The Servants," which established him as a major figure in the German theater. </p><p>During the 1920s, Bronnen was associated with the Expressionist movement and was known for his highly stylized and unconventional productions. He directed plays by Bertolt Brecht, Georg Kaiser, and other major playwrights of the era. In the 1930s, he became increasingly involved in politics and aligned himself with the Nazi party. After the war, he was arrested and spent several years in prison.</p><p>In the late 1940s, Bronnen moved to East Germany and began working for the state-run theater. He wrote plays and screenplays, including the highly successful film "Rotation." Despite his earlier Nazi connections, he was able to establish himself as a prominent cultural figure in the German Democratic Republic, where he remained until his death in 1959.</p><p>Despite his success as a playwright and theatre director, Arnolt Bronnen was a controversial figure due to his political affiliations. He was an early supporter of the Nazi party and even served as a member of the SA (Sturmabteilung), the Nazi party's paramilitary organization. In 1933, he wrote a pro-Nazi play called "Vaterlandslied" (Fatherland Song) which was well-received by the Nazi regime.

He was known for his innovative use of language and his mastery of atmosphere and mood. Many of his plays dealt with themes of social injustice, and he often used his work to explore the complexities of the human psyche.

For example, his invention made it possible to record and preserve historical speeches, music performances, and radio broadcasts, which might otherwise have been lost forever.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Pfleumer's life was not without its struggles. During World War II, he was briefly arrested by the Gestapo due to his anti-Nazi views, and he was also affected by the bombing of Dresden in 1945, which destroyed his laboratory and most of his personal belongings.</p><p>Pfleumer died later that year from a heart attack at the age of 64, but his impact on the world of sound recording and broadcasting lives on. Today, magnetic tape technology has largely been replaced by digital recording, but Pfleumer's contributions continue to be celebrated by engineers, musicians, and sound enthusiasts around the world.</p><p>In addition to his engineering work, Pfleumer had a passion for music and played the piano and violin. He often collaborated with musicians to test and improve his magnetic tape technology.
