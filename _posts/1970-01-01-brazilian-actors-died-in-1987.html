was
a Brazilian
actor.


						</p><p>
							He gained notoriety for his role as the titular character in the film "Pixote, a Lei do Mais Fraco" (Pixote, the Law of the Weakest) directed by Hector Babenco in 1981. The film depicts the grim life of a group of impoverished children and teenagers who turn to crime to survive on the streets of São Paulo. Ramos Da Silva was only 11 years old when he was cast in the lead role, and his naturalistic and heartbreaking performance earned him critical acclaim both in Brazil and internationally. Unfortunately, his promising acting career was cut short in 1987 when he was shot and killed by police while trying to steal a car. He was only 19 years old at the time of his death, but his legacy lives on through his poignant portrayal of Pixote, a symbol of the social inequality and violence that plagued Brazil's urban landscape in the 1980s.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=42600635" title="Wikipedia article about Fernando Ramos Da Silva">Fernando Ramos Da Silva on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swedish-actors-born-in-1979.html' title='Swedish actors born in 1979'><strong>Swedish actors born in 1979</strong> List of the top 6 Swedish actors who were born in 1979</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-actors-died-in-2000.html' title='Japanese actors died in 2000'><strong>Japanese actors died in 2000</strong> List of the top 2 Japanese actors who died in 2000</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-peritonitis.html' title='Famous actors died in Peritonitis'><strong>Famous actors died in Peritonitis</strong> List of the top 11 Famous actors who died in Peritonitis</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-1956.html' title='American actors died in 1956'><strong>American actors died in 1956</strong> List of the top 45 American actors who died in 1956</a></li><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-appendicitis.html' title='American actors died in Appendicitis'><strong>American actors died in Appendicitis</strong> List of the top 2 American actors who died in Appendicitis</a></li><li><a href='/bosnian-actors-died-in-2007.html' title='Bosnian actors died in 2007'><strong>Bosnian actors died in 2007</strong> List of the top 2 Bosnian actors who died in 2007</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
