During his long and distinguished career, Vening Meinesz also made significant contributions to the study of earthquakes and volcanoes, and he pioneered the use of deep-sea submersibles to explore the ocean floor. He received many awards and honors for his work, including the prestigious Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, and was widely regarded as one of the greatest scientists of his time. Vening Meinesz also served as a professor of geodesy at the Universiteit Utrecht for many years, where he inspired and mentored countless aspiring geophysicists.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Vening Meinesz was a decorated military officer, having served in both World War I and World War II. During World War II, he was imprisoned by the Nazis for refusing to collaborate with them, and he spent three years in a German prison camp. Despite the hardships he faced, Vening Meinesz continued to conduct scientific research while in captivity, using improvised equipment to measure the Earth's gravity. After the war, he returned to the Netherlands and resumed his scientific work, publishing numerous papers and articles on geophysics and related fields. Vening Meinesz's legacy continues to inspire scientists and researchers today, and his contributions to our understanding of the Earth have had a profound impact on many different areas of study.</p><p></p><p>

(July 29, 1896		Netherlands-April 5, 1976)


was
a Dutch
diplomat.


					</p><p>During WWII, Zwartendijk was serving as the acting Dutch consul in Kaunas, Lithuania. In that capacity, he issued over 2,000 unauthorized visas to Jewish refugees fleeing from Nazi persecution. The visas allowed them to escape to the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao, which was an overseas territory of the Netherlands at the time. </p><p>Zwartendijk's actions have been credited with saving hundreds, if not thousands, of lives. However, he kept the details of his actions a secret for many years, and only spoke publicly about them after being tracked down by some of the survivors who he had helped. </p><p>In 1997, Zwartendijk was posthumously recognized as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem, Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.</p><p>Zwartendijk was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and studied commerce at the Netherlands Trading Society before becoming a businessman. He later worked in various managerial positions in international trade and lived in France, England, and the United States. In 1939, he was appointed as the honorary consul for the Netherlands in Lithuania, where he and his wife settled in Kaunas. </p><p>Zwartendijk's assistance to Jewish refugees started after the Soviet Union annexed Lithuania in June 1940. He received a request for assistance from a group of Jewish refugees who were trying to flee Europe. Knowing that issuing visas would be against official Dutch policy, Zwartendijk decided to pose a complicated question to his superiors in the Dutch Foreign Ministry about whether it would be possible to facilitate the emigration of Jews to the Dutch colonies. The answer he received was that such action would be left to the discretion of local authorities. </p><p>Zwartendijk then contacted Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul in Kaunas, who had already started issuing transit visas to Jews so they could travel to Japan. Sugihara agreed to issue visas to those holding Dutch visas, thereby allowing them to escape Europe. Zwartendijk started issuing the unauthorized visas, which he called "Curacao visas," that listed Curaçao as the destination. Although the visas were not official Dutch documents, they allowed their holders to leave Lithuania and be welcomed by Dutch authorities in Curaçao.</p><p>Zwartendijk continued to issue the visas until the Dutch embassy in Riga officially took over the duties of the consulate in Kaunas in August 1940. After the war, Zwartendijk resumed his business career and lived in the United States, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. He did not receive any formal recognition for his actions until 1997 when he was awarded the Righteous Among the Nations medal by Yad Vashem. The Dutch government also recognized him as a national hero and established the Zwartendijk Award for individuals who demonstrate similar acts of humanitarianism.</p><p></p><p>
