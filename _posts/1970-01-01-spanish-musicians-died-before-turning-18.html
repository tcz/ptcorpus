					</p><p>Profiat Duran, also known as Efodi, was a Spanish philosopher and polemicist who lived during the 14th and 15th centuries. He was born in Perpignan, France, but spent most of his life in Catalonia, Spain. Duran was a prolific writer and commentator on both Jewish and Christian philosophy and was known for his critical views on the Catholic Church. He was an advocate for the use of reason and logic, and his work often sought to reconcile Jewish thought with Aristotelian philosophy. Duran's most famous work is his "Kabbalah of the Prophecy", which discusses the relationship between the Torah and Kabbalah. He was also known for his commentary on Maimonides' "Guide for the Perplexed" and his defense of Jewish law and tradition against attacks from Christian theologians. Despite facing significant opposition during his lifetime, Duran's work had a lasting influence on Jewish philosophy and theology, and his ideas continue to be studied and debated to this day.</p><p>In addition to his philosophical writing, Duran was also known for his engagement in debates and polemics with Christian theologians.

His philosophical and theological work had a significant impact on the development of Jewish thought in Spain and beyond, and he is considered one of the most important Jewish thinkers of the 14th and 15th centuries.</p><p>Despite his significant contributions to Jewish philosophy, Duran's legacy was overshadowed by the tragic events that occurred towards the end of his life. In 1391, anti-Jewish riots broke out throughout Spain, leading to the forced conversion or expulsion of thousands of Jews. Duran and his daughter were among those who chose to convert, and he thereafter resorted to living a double life, outwardly appearing to be a devout Christian while continuing to secretly practice Judaism. He died in 1427 in a state of emotional and spiritual turmoil, having been unable to reconcile his public persona with his inner beliefs.

His works were highly regarded by the likes of the philosopher and theologian, Thomas Aquinas, who cited Duran's ideas on the mistaken belief in the omnipotence of God.

Despite his controversial legacy, Duran's intellectual curiosity and commitment to reason and logic continue to inspire scholars and thinkers of all backgrounds.</p><p>Additionally, Profiat Duran was known for his expertise in astronomy and astrology. He wrote a treatise on the Jewish calendar, which discussed the calculation of lunar and solar cycles and their relation to Jewish holidays.

(April 5, 2015		Cádiz-April 5, 2015			Madrid)

	
		also known as José Joaquín Vicente de Iturrigaray y Aróstegui

	
was
a Spanish
military officer.


					</p><p>He served as the captain general of the Captaincy General of Guatemala and then as the viceroy of New Spain from 1803 to 1808. During his time as viceroy, he tried to implement reforms to improve the economic and political situation in New Spain, but he faced opposition from the Spanish elites and the Church. His efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and he was deposed and imprisoned by a group of conspirators who supported the Spanish War of Independence. Iturrigaray was accused of being sympathetic to the independence movement and was eventually sent back to Spain, where he lived in exile until his death. His legacy is a subject of debate among historians, with some regarding him as a potential agent of change for New Spain, while others see him as a political opportunist who failed to navigate the complex political landscape of the time.</p><p>Iturrigaray was born to a noble family in Cádiz, Spain. He joined the military at a young age and rose through the ranks to become a captain general. His appointment as viceroy of New Spain was seen as controversial by some members of the Spanish court due to his lack of experience in colonial administration. Nonetheless, Iturrigaray tried to introduce several reforms during his tenure, including the promotion of local economic development, the establishment of a liberal press, and the introduction of measures to protect indigenous peoples. He also tried to reduce the power of the Inquisition and the Catholic Church, which had long held significant influence in New Spain.</p><p>Iturrigaray's reforms met with resistance from many conservative groups in New Spain - the creole elites, who feared losing their power to the Spanish Crown, and the Catholic Church, which was against any attempts to limit its political and economic power. The situation was further complicated by the outbreak of the Spanish War of Independence in 1808, which pitted Spanish loyalists against those who supported Napoleon's invasion of Spain. Iturrigaray was accused of sympathizing with the independence movement and was arrested by a group of conspirators who overthrew him in a coup.</p><p>Despite protests and petitions from New Spain, Iturrigaray was sent back to Spain, where he was imprisoned and experienced political persecution until his death in 1815. His legacy remains a controversial matter for historians, with some considering him a brave reformer who tried to improve conditions in New Spain, while others see him as a naive politician who was unable to overcome the entrenched interests of the colonial elites. Regardless of the ultimate verdict, Iturrigaray's efforts to modernize colonial institutions and to promote economic development in New Spain laid the groundwork for later generations of reformers who eventually brought about Mexican independence.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Iturrigaray was an advocate for the abolition of the African slave trade and took steps towards implementing this policy during his time as viceroy. He also sought to improve conditions for the indigenous population in Mexico, with some historians crediting him for initiating a more humane treatment of native peoples. Iturrigaray's short-lived tenure as viceroy highlighted the complex power dynamics at play in colonial Mexico and the challenges faced by those who sought to modernize the country's institutions. While his reforms ultimately failed, Iturrigaray's legacy as a reformer and advocate for marginalized groups continues to be studied and debated by historians today.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that during his tenure as viceroy, José de Iturrigaray commissioned several scientific expeditions to explore and document the flora, fauna, and geography of New Spain. These expeditions led to significant advancements in the fields of botany, zoology, and geology, and helped to expand the knowledge of the natural world in Europe. Iturrigaray was also a patron of the arts and supported the development of cultural institutions in New Spain, including the National Museum of Anthropology and the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico. In addition, he granted several important concessions to the mining industry, which helped to boost the economy of New Spain. Despite his efforts to improve the country, Iturrigaray was ultimately unsuccessful in enacting lasting change, and his legacy as a failed reformer continues to be debated by scholars. Nonetheless, his contributions as a patron of the arts and sciences, as well as his attempts to promote social justice for marginalized groups, have cemented his place in Mexican history.</p><p>It should be noted that Iturrigaray's commissioning of scientific explorations was a part of a larger movement in New Spain towards Enlightenment thinking, which emphasized the importance of reason, science, and progress. Iturrigaray was a proponent of these ideals, which led him to advocate for reforms that would promote social and economic advancement in Mexico. His efforts were not limited to New Spain, however, as he also worked to improve conditions in other Spanish colonies, including the Philippines and Puerto Rico. His advocacy for the abolition of the African slave trade also extended beyond the borders of New Spain, as he argued for a global ban on the practice.</p><p>Iturrigaray's legacy is complicated by the fact that he was deposed and imprisoned on charges of treason, which were likely the result of a conspiracy by conservative forces who opposed his reform agenda. His imprisonment and subsequent exile meant that he did not live to see the fruition of his ideas or the eventual independence of Mexico. Nonetheless, his efforts to advance the cause of social justice and scientific progress paved the way for future generations of reformers who sought to build a more just and equitable society. Iturrigaray's life and legacy highlight the complexities of colonial politics and the challenges faced by those who sought to change the status quo.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 2015		Majorca-April 5, 2015			Sagres)


was
a Spanish
personality.


					</p><p>Jehuda Cresques was a Jewish cartographer and navigator who was born on the island of Majorca, which was then part of the Crown of Aragon, in 1325. He was known for creating elaborate and detailed maps, particularly of the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, which were used by sailors and merchants for centuries. Cresques was part of a famous family of mapmakers, which included his father Abraham Cresques, who is also credited with creating several important maps.</p><p>In addition to his work as a cartographer, Cresques was also a skilled navigator and explorer. He was part of several maritime expeditions, including a voyage to the Canary Islands in 1341, and is believed to have traveled as far as the West African coast.</p><p>Cresques' most famous work is the Catalan Atlas, a large and elaborate map that he created in 1375. This map, which is now housed in the Bibliotheque Nationale de France in Paris, contains detailed depictions of cities, landscapes, and people from across the world, and is considered a masterpiece of medieval cartography.</p><p>Despite his important contributions to geography and navigation, relatively little is known about Cresques' personal life. He died in Sagres, Portugal, in 1387.</p><p>Cresques' legacy as a mapmaker and navigator continued long after his death, with his maps remaining in use for centuries. The Catalan Atlas in particular was highly influential and was still being consulted by navigators as late as the 18th century. In addition to his accomplishments as a mapmaker and sailor, Cresques was also known for his skill in making intricate and decorative compass roses, which he included on many of his maps. His maps and navigation tools have been studied and admired by scholars and historians for centuries, and he is remembered as one of the most important cartographers of the medieval period.</p><p>Cresques' work as a cartographer and navigator was particularly significant because it came at a time when Europe was experiencing a period of great exploration and expansion. His maps helped sailors and merchants navigate new trade routes and explore new territories, paving the way for future exploration and discovery. </p><p>Cresques' work also had a significant impact on cultural and religious history. As a Jewish cartographer working in medieval Europe, he was part of a community of scholars and artists who contributed to the development of a unique blend of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic cultural traditions. His maps often featured depictions of both Christian and Islamic landmarks, and he was known for including Jewish motifs and symbols in his compass roses. </p><p>Today, Cresques is remembered as one of the greatest mapmakers of the medieval period, a master of his craft whose work had a lasting impact on the world of geography and navigation. His maps are still admired for their accuracy, detail, and beauty, and his legacy as a navigator and explorer continues to inspire new generations of adventurers.</p><p>Cresques' family was originally from the Kingdom of Majorca, and they were Jewish conversos - Jews who had converted to Christianity but still secretly practiced their Jewish faith. His family was part of a vibrant and influential Jewish community in Majorca, which included many other cartographers, scholars, and artists. This community played a key role in the development of the Majorcan School of cartography, which was known for its innovative and artistic approach to mapmaking.</p><p>Cresques himself was known for his artistic talent, and his maps were notable for their beautiful and intricate illustrations. He was particularly skilled at depicting exotic animals, landscapes, and people from faraway lands, and his maps were works of art as well as practical navigational tools.</p><p>In addition to his work as a mapmaker and navigator, Cresques was also involved in the politics and diplomacy of his time. He worked for the King of Aragon and helped negotiate treaties and agreements with other European powers, including the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of England.</p><p>Despite enduring centuries of neglect and obscurity, Cresques' work has undergone a revival in recent years. Scholars and collectors have rediscovered his maps and recognized their importance as cultural and artistic treasures. Today, his maps are displayed in museums and private collections around the world, and his legacy as one of the greatest mapmakers of all time continues to inspire and influence cartographers and explorers.</p><p>One notable aspect of Jehuda Cresques' work is his use of the portolan chart style, which was popular among Mediterranean cartographers at the time. Portolan charts were navigational maps that depicted coastlines, ports, and landmarks, used primarily by sailors for coastal navigation. Cresques' maps, however, went beyond the traditional portolan chart format by incorporating illustrations and decorative elements, elevating them into works of art.</p><p>Cresques' work also reflects the cosmopolitan culture of medieval Spain, which was influenced by both Muslim and Christian traditions. His maps feature a blend of Islamic and Christian place names, as well as depictions of both Jewish and non-Jewish sites. He was reputedly fluent in Arabic, which allowed him to access important geographical information from Arab sources and incorporate it into his work.</p><p>Cresques' influence can also be seen in the work of later cartographers, including the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus, who made use of Cresques' maps in his own voyages of discovery. Columbus even carried a copy of the Catalan Atlas on his famous voyage in 1492.</p><p>In recent years, Cresques' work has been the subject of numerous exhibitions and scholarly studies. His maps continue to fascinate and inspire, and his legacy as one of the most important cartographers of all time remains secure.</p><p></p><p>

He was a powerful nobleman and military commander who served under King Wamba. In 672, after Wamba's reign ended, Acisclus was one of the main leaders of a rebellion against the new king, King Erwig. Although the rebellion failed, Acisclus remained an influential figure in Visigothic politics and was eventually appointed as a bishop. He is also known for his involvement in the Council of Braga in 675, where he helped to establish the primacy of the bishop of Rome over the other bishops in Hispania.</p><p>Acisclus played a key role in securing the unity of the Visigothic Church and establishing it as a powerful force in Hispania. He is considered as one of the most important bishops of his time and contributed significantly to the spread of Christianity in Spain. Acisclus's legacy has been immortalized in the iconic Retablo of San Acislo, a beautiful 18th-century altarpiece featuring his martyrdom. Today, he is venerated as a saint by many Catholics in Spain and continues to be an important figure in the country's history.</p><p>Acisclus was born in the early 7th century in Spain, although little is known about his early life. He first came to prominence as a military commander under King Wamba, and his loyalty and bravery earned him favor with the king. When Wamba's reign ended in 672, Acisclus was among the nobles who opposed the new king, Erwig. The rebellion failed, but Acisclus continued to be a powerful figure in Visigothic politics.</p><p>In 675, Acisclus took part in the Council of Braga, one of the most important church councils of the Visigothic period. At the council, he argued in favor of the primacy of the bishop of Rome over the other bishops in Hispania. This position was accepted and came to be known as the doctrine of the "Roman primacy." Acisclus became one of the leading proponents of this doctrine, which reinforced the unity of the Visigothic Church and its ties to Rome.</p><p>Later in life, Acisclus was appointed as the bishop of Cordoba, where he continued to promote the Roman primacy and worked to spread Christianity throughout the region. He is believed to have been martyred during the persecution of Christians under the Muslim conquest of Spain. His martyrdom was depicted in the Retablo of San Acislo, a stunningly detailed altarpiece that has become a beloved icon of Spanish art.</p><p>Today, Acisclus is remembered as a key figure in the history of the Visigothic Kingdom and the spread of Christianity in Spain. His advocacy for the Roman primacy helped to unify the church and establish it as a powerful force in Hispania. He is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church and continues to be an important figure in Spanish history and culture.</p><p>In addition to his role in the Visigothic Kingdom, Acisclus is also known for his contributions to Christian theology. He authored several works on the nature of the trinity and the divinity of Christ, which were highly regarded by his contemporaries. Acisclus also played a role in introducing the practice of monasticism to Hispania, which had a profound impact on the development of Christian spirituality in the region.</p><p>Acisclus's influence continued long after his death. Many churches and religious institutions in Spain are named after him, and he is considered a patron saint of Cordoba, the city where he served as bishop. His legacy as a theologian and church leader continues to inspire scholars and practitioners of the Christian faith, and his martyrdom is celebrated every year on November 17th.</p><p>Furthermore, some scholars believe that Acisclus was also involved in the Visigothic codification of laws, known as the Visigothic Code. He may have played a role in shaping the legal system of the kingdom and ensuring that it was in line with Christian values. Acisclus's commitment to Christianity was also evident in his efforts to convert the Jewish population of Cordoba to Christianity, which he pursued through both peaceful means and more forceful tactics.</p><p>Acisclus's life and work serve as a testament to the important role that religion played in the politics and culture of medieval Spain. His advocacy for the Roman primacy helped to establish the Visigothic Church as a powerful institution, while his writings on Christian theology continue to be studied by scholars today.

(April 5, 2015		Crecente-April 5, 2015			Córdoba)


was
a Spanish
personality.


					</p><p>Pelagius of Cordova was a theologian and monk who is known for his advocacy of the concept of free will in Christianity during the 4th century. He was born in Crecente, Galicia, Spain in 354 AD and later joined a monastic community in Cordova. Pelagius gained prominence for his teachings on the nature of sin and salvation, arguing that humans have the ability to choose between good and evil on their own free will, without divine intervention. This challenged the widely accepted doctrine of original sin and predestination upheld by the Church at the time. Pelagianism, the name for this theology, became a source of controversy and was eventually condemned as heretical by the Councils of Carthage and Ephesus. Despite this, Pelagius remained a respected figure in his monastery until his death in 418 AD. His ideas continue to be debated by theologians and scholars today.</p><p>Pelagius of Cordova's controversial ideas regarding free will were not taken lightly by the Church during his time. He engaged in debates with the theologian Saint Augustine, who was a proponent of the doctrine of original sin. Pelagius was accused of denying the necessity of divine grace and being too humanistic in his approach to salvation. His beliefs challenged the authority of the Church and led to the rise of factions known as Pelagians. Despite being ostracized by the Church, Pelagius maintained a strong following and his ideas continue to influence Christianity to this day. He is remembered not just as an influential theologian, but also as a symbol of the power of individual thought and the search for truth.</p><p>Pelagius of Cordova was also known for his advocacy of asceticism, or the practice of self-discipline and self-denial, as a way to avoid sin and achieve spiritual purity. He believed in the importance of living a simple and humble life, and promoted the virtues of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Pelagius also focused on the practical aspects of Christian life, such as the importance of prayer and good works. He believed that these actions were not just a means to earn salvation, but were also an expression of gratitude and love for God. Despite his disagreements with the Church, Pelagius maintained his adherence to orthodox Christian doctrine, and rejected accusations of heresy. He continued to write and speak on matters of theology, and was highly respected by his fellow monks and scholars. Pelagius of Cordova's legacy lies in his bold challenge to dogmatic thinking, and his insistence on the power of human agency in matters of faith and morality.</p><p>In addition to his theological contributions, Pelagius of Cordova was also a prominent figure in the monastic community of Cordova. He was known for his austere lifestyle and devotion to prayer, leading by example in his teachings of asceticism. Pelagius was also noted for his humility and kindness towards others, and his ability to bridge the gap between the educated elite and the common people. He was viewed as a spiritual leader and mentor by many, and his teachings on free will and personal responsibility continue to resonate with those seeking a more individualistic and humanistic approach to Christianity. Despite the controversy and condemnation that surrounded his ideas, Pelagius' legacy has endured as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between personal conscience and institutional authority in matters of faith.</p><p>Pelagius of Cordova's ideas continued to be influential long after his death, particularly during the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. His emphasis on individual agency and the rejection of predestination resonated with the reformers, who sought to challenge the authority of the Catholic Church. However, Pelagius' ideas were also criticized for their potential to lead to a lack of emphasis on divine grace and the need for salvation. In contemporary scholarship, Pelagius is often seen as a precursor to modern liberal Protestantism, which emphasizes the importance of individual responsibility and ethical action in the pursuit of faith. Despite the controversy surrounding his beliefs, Pelagius of Cordova remains an important figure in the history of Christian thought, and a symbol of the ongoing conversation between tradition and innovation in matters of faith.</p><p></p><p>
