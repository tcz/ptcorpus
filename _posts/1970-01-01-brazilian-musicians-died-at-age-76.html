(April 2, 1896		Odessa-July 27, 1972			São Paulo)


was
a Brazilian
architect.


					</p><p>He was born in Ukraine and moved to Brazil in 1923, where he became one of the pioneers of modern architecture. Warchavchik's work was heavily influenced by European modernism, particularly the ideas and principles of Le Corbusier. His most famous work is the Casa Modernista, located in São Paulo, which was the first example of modernist architecture in Brazil. Warchavchik's designs were characterized by their clean lines, functionalism, and use of new materials such as reinforced concrete. He also played an important role in the development of Brazilian architecture through his teaching and his involvement in the creation of the Brazilian Institute of Architects. Throughout his career, Warchavchik continued to advocate for modernist principles and the need to break away from traditional architecture.</p><p>Aside from the Casa Modernista, Gregori Warchavchik's other notable architectural works include the Praça da Sé housing complex and the Higienópolis neighborhood in São Paulo. He was also a prolific writer, publishing several books on architecture and urbanism, including "Brazil Builds" in 1943, which was the first book to showcase Brazilian modern architecture. Warchavchik was a part of the "Group of Four," which was a group of architects that included Lina Bo Bardi, Gian Carlo Palanti, and Brazilian-British architect Serge Chermayeff, who were all proponents of the modernist movement in Brazil. Despite his contributions to architecture, Warchavchik struggled to gain commissions for his designs due to their unorthodox style. However, his legacy has lived on, and his impact on Brazilian modernism has been widely recognized. In 2003, the Casa Modernista was declared a National Historic and Artistic Heritage Site by the Brazilian government.</p><p>Warchavchik's upbringing in Ukraine was heavily influenced by his family's Jewish heritage, and he grew up speaking Russian, Yiddish, and Hebrew. Before moving to Brazil, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome and later worked for several prominent architects in Europe, including Adolf Loos in Vienna. </p><p>Upon arriving in Brazil, Warchavchik quickly became involved in the local artistic and intellectual circles, and he began to advocate for a new approach to architecture that would reflect the country's modern, industrialized identity. He was a founding member of the Modernist Movement in Brazil, which sought to break away from the country's colonial past and embrace a more progressive, cosmopolitan vision of the future. </p><p>In addition to his architectural work and teaching, Warchavchik was also involved in politics and social activism. He supported the leftist government of President Getúlio Vargas and was a member of the Brazilian Communist Party for a time. He also pushed for greater recognition of women in the field of architecture, and he worked closely with his wife, Mina Klabin, who was also a prominent architect and designer. </p><p>Despite facing significant opposition from traditionalists in the architectural community, Warchavchik remained committed to his vision of modernism throughout his life. He continued to design buildings and write about architecture until his death in 1972. Today, he is recognized as a key figure in the development of modernism in Brazil and a pioneer of contemporary Brazilian architecture.</p><p>Warchavchik's influence on Brazilian architecture was not limited to his designs or teaching. He also played an active role in shaping the profession itself. In 1929, he founded the first private school of architecture in Brazil, the School of Modern Architecture, in São Paulo. The school was based on the principles of the Bauhaus, and it aimed to produce architects who would be able to respond to the challenges of modernity. Warchavchik himself taught at the school, and his colleagues included some of the most important modernist architects in Brazil, such as Roberto Burle Marx, Carlos Leão, and Rino Levi. The School of Modern Architecture was a crucial incubator for the modernist movement in Brazil and played a key role in shaping the country's architectural culture.</p><p>Warchavchik was also a vocal advocate for urban planning and urban design. He believed that modern architecture could play a crucial role in shaping the urban environment and making cities more livable and functional. In 1943, he co-authored a book on urban planning with his wife, Mina Klabin, called "Urbanism: Its Techniques and Philosophy." The book applied modernist principles to the design of cities and advocated for a more rational approach to urban planning. It was one of the first books on urban planning published in Brazil and helped to establish the field in the country.</p><p>In addition to his architectural work, teaching, and writing, Warchavchik was also a talented artist. He studied painting and drawing at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome and continued to paint throughout his life. His paintings were inspired by the natural and built environment of Brazil and often featured bold, abstract forms and bright colors. Although he was never primarily known as a painter, his artwork demonstrates his deep commitment to modernist principles and his belief in the power of art and architecture to shape the world.</p><p>Today, Warchavchik's legacy endures in his buildings, his writings, and his influence on the profession of architecture in Brazil. His work continues to inspire architects and designers who are committed to the principles of modernism and to creating a better, more equitable world through architecture and design.</p><p>Warchavchik's life and work were also deeply impacted by the political and social changes that occurred in Brazil during his career. In the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil underwent a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization, which led to significant changes in the country's social and cultural landscape. Warchavchik remained committed to his modernist principles throughout this time, but he also recognized the need to adapt his designs to the changing needs of Brazilian society. He began to incorporate more social and environmental considerations into his designs, such as the use of green spaces and natural light to promote well-being.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Warchavchik faced significant challenges throughout his career. His unorthodox designs and adherence to modernist principles often put him at odds with traditionalists in the architectural community, who criticized his work as cold, sterile, and too abstract. He also faced financial difficulties throughout his career, and he struggled to gain commissions for his designs. Nevertheless, Warchavchik remained dedicated to his vision of modernism and his commitment to social and environmental responsibility, and his contributions continue to inspire architects and designers today.</p><p></p><p>

He emigrated to Brazil in 1852, where he lived in the state of Santa Catarina for over four decades. During this time, he conducted extensive research on the flora and fauna of the region, publishing over 70 papers in various scientific journals. </p><p>Müller is best known for his work on Müllerian mimicry, a type of protective mimicry in which multiple species evolve to resemble each other, each benefiting from the protection that the group provides. He also made important observations about the role of pollinators in plant reproduction, and described new species of animals and plants. In addition to his scientific work, Müller was involved in the development of the German settlement of Blumenau, where he served as a city councilor and helped establish schools, libraries, and scientific organizations.</p><p>Müller grew up in a religious family and was initially intended to become a priest. However, after studying medicine in Berlin, he became increasingly interested in natural history and eventually decided to pursue a career in biology. He became friends with Charles Darwin and corresponded with him frequently, sharing his observations and ideas on evolution.</p><p>In Brazil, Müller faced many challenges, including language barriers and unfamiliar environments. He worked as a pharmacist, a teacher, and a farmer, all while conducting his scientific research. He became fluent in Portuguese and developed close relationships with the local population, including the indigenous people, whom he admired and defended from exploitation.</p><p>Müller's contributions to science were recognized during his lifetime, and he received honors from German and Brazilian scientific institutions. Today, he is remembered as one of the most influential biologists of the 19th century and a pioneer in the study of mimicry and coevolution. Blumenau has honored his legacy by establishing the Fritz Müller Museum, which houses his preserved collections and documents.</p><p>Müller's legacy influenced not only the scientific community but also the literary world. He inspired the character of "Fritz" in Naturalist writer William Henry Hudson's book "The Naturalist in La Plata", and he was recognized by other famous writers, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who praised his work in his journals.
