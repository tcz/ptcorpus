					</p><p>Bent Faurschou Hviid, also known as Flammen (The Flame), was a member of the Danish resistance movement during World War II. He was known for his daring activities, which included sabotage, armed robberies, and attacks against the occupying German forces.</p><p>Hviid became involved in the resistance at a young age and quickly rose through the ranks due to his fearlessness, tactical skills, and charisma. He eventually became the leader of one of the most successful resistance groups in Denmark.</p><p>However, Hviid's activities also made him a target of the Gestapo, and he was eventually captured in September 1944. Despite being severely tortured, he refused to reveal any information about his comrades.</p><p>On October 18, 1944, Hviid was found dead in his cell at the Gentofte Hospital. It is widely believed that he committed suicide to avoid giving any information to the Gestapo during his interrogation.</p><p>Despite his short life, Bent Faurschou Hviid remains a hero in Denmark, and his daring actions continue to inspire generations.</p><p>Hviid's legacy is honored in many ways in Denmark. In 1950, a statue was erected in his name in Frederiksberg Gardens in Copenhagen. The Danish movie, "Flammen og Citronen" (Flame and Citron), released in 2008, is a fictionalized account of Hviid's life and his work in the resistance. Furthermore, an annual Flammen Run is held in Hviid's honor, where participants run the distance between Hviid's birthplace and his burial site. His life and work have inspired many young people to stand up against oppression and fight for what is right.</p><p>Hviid's role in the resistance is considered significant to Denmark's victory in World War II, and he is remembered as a national hero. He was awarded the British King's Medal for Courage in the Cause of Freedom posthumously. His life story has been documented in several books, including "Flammen: Kæmper mod tyskerne" (Flammen: Fighting Against the Germans) by Nina Christoffersen and "The Flame and the Sea" by Morten Ramsland. In addition to the annual Flammen Run, Hviid's memory is honored through exhibits at the Danish Resistance Museum in Copenhagen, including his personal belongings, photographs, and letters.

(November 30, 1936		Aarhus-August 26, 1960			Rome)


was
a Danish
personality.


					</p><p>Jensen was a cyclist who competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics held in Rome. During the team time trial event, he collapsed due to a combination of heat exhaustion and the use of amphetamines. He was taken to a hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after. His death sparked controversy and led to increased measures against drug use in sports. In addition to his cycling career, Jensen was studying engineering at Aarhus University and was known for his athleticism and dedication to the sport.</p><p>Jensen grew up in a family of cyclists and was introduced to the sport at a young age. He began competing in cycling races as a teenager and quickly became a rising star in the Danish cycling scene. In 1958, he won his first Danish National Road Race Championship and went on to win the title again in 1959.</p><p>Jensen's success on the bike earned him a spot on the Danish cycling team for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. He was considered one of Denmark's best hopes for a medal in the team time trial event, which involved cycling a 100km course as a team.</p><p>Tragically, Jensen's Olympic dreams were cut short when he collapsed during the race. He was initially treated by medics at the side of the road before being rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed that he had taken a mixture of amphetamines and alcohol, which likely contributed to his collapse.</p><p>Jensen's death shocked the sports world and led to renewed scrutiny of drug use in sports. In Denmark, his memory is honored with the Knud Enemark Jensen Memorial Award, which is given annually to a young Danish cyclist who shows promise in the sport.</p><p>After his death, there were several theories about what caused Jensen's collapse, including heat stroke, dehydration, and the use of drugs. It was later discovered that he had taken Ronicol, a type of amphetamine that was commonly used by athletes at the time as a performance-enhancing drug. The use of such drugs was not illegal at the time, but Jensen's death served as a wake-up call to many people in the sports world about the dangers of doping.</p><p>In addition to his athletic achievements, Jensen was known for his dedication to his studies. He was studying engineering at Aarhus University while also pursuing his cycling career. His death was not only a loss to the sports world but also to his academic community.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Knud Enemark Jensen remains a respected figure in Danish sports history. He is remembered not only for his achievements on the bike but also for his dedication to his studies and his commitment to his sport. His death highlighted the need for increased awareness of the dangers of doping in sports and led to changes in policies and regulations that continue to be in effect today.</p><p></p><p>
