(January 27, 1982		Egypt-June 6, 2010)

	
		otherwise known as Khaled Mohammed Sa&#039;eed or Khaled Mohamed Saeed

	
was
an Egyptian
personality.


					</p><p>He became a symbol of police brutality and sparked the 2011 Egyptian revolution after his death at the hands of two police officers. Saeed's death became a rallying cry for Egyptians who were fed up with the regime's brutality and corruption. His death also prompted an online campaign called "We are all Khaled Saeed," which called for an end to police brutality and demanded justice for Saeed. The movement played an important role in the Egyptian revolution and the eventual overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak. Today, Saeed is remembered as a symbol of the struggle for freedom and justice in Egypt.</p><p>Following his death, photos of Saeed's disfigured face were circulated online, which fueled outrage towards the Egyptian authorities. Witnesses claimed that Saeed was beaten to death by two police officers after he resisted their attempt to search him. The officers were later sentenced to 7 years in prison for excessive use of force. Saeed's death prompted massive protests across Egypt, with tens of thousands taking to the streets to demand an end to police brutality and a change in the ruling regime. The "We are all Khaled Saeed" Facebook page, which was created to honor his memory, became an important platform for activists to coordinate protests and share information. Saeed's family was also a source of inspiration for the Egyptian people, as they tirelessly fought for justice for their son and refused to stay silent, despite the risks. His death, as well as the efforts to seek justice for him, are seen as a turning point in Egypt's modern history.</p><p></p><p>
