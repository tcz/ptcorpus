(April 5, 1382		Carmagnola-May 5, 1432)

	
		a.k.a. the Carmagnola or Count of Carmagnola

	
was
an Italian
mercenary.


					</p><p>Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola began his career in the military as a loyal servant of the Duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo Visconti. He rose to prominence quickly and became a trusted advisor and commander in the Visconti army. However, in 1412, he switched sides and joined forces with the Venetians, who were in conflict with Milan.</p><p>Bussone proved to be a skilled leader, and he was able to secure several victories for Venice, including the capture of Verona. He was rewarded for his efforts with the title of Count of Carmagnola and was given land and property in the Venetian Republic.</p><p>However, Bussone's relationship with Venice began to deteriorate, and he was eventually accused of treason and arrested in 1431. He was brought before a tribunal and ultimately found guilty. Bussone was sentenced to death by beheading, and the sentence was carried out the following year.</p><p>Despite his gruesome end, Bussone is remembered as an accomplished military leader who played a significant role in the conflicts between Milan and Venice during the early 15th century.</p><p>Bussone was born into a noble family in Carmagnola, a town in the Piedmont region of Italy. Little is known about his early life or family background. He first came to prominence as a soldier and military commander under Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan. It was during his time under Visconti that Bussone honed his skills as a military strategist and leader.</p><p>As a mercenary, Bussone was known for his quick thinking and tactical abilities, as well as his willingness to switch sides if it meant gaining an advantage. His decision to join forces with the Venetians was a major turning point in the conflicts between Milan and Venice, and helped to tip the scales in favor of the latter.</p><p>Following his capture and execution, Bussone's name became synonymous with treachery and betrayal in Venetian lore. However, some historians have argued that his actions were motivated by a desire for personal gain, rather than a lack of loyalty or patriotism.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his career and legacy, Bussone is widely regarded as one of Italy's most talented military commanders of the early Renaissance era. His life and career continue to be studied by military historians and scholars to this day.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in decapitation.
