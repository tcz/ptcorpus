						Vives was a prominent figure in the Spanish musical scene in the early 20th century. He began his career as a piano accompanist and composer of art songs, gaining recognition for his particularly melodic and expressive style. However, it was in the genre of zarzuela, a form of musical theater popular in Spain, where Vives found his greatest success. He wrote over 30 zarzuelas, many of which are still performed today, such as "Doña Francisquita" and "Bohemios."</p><p>In addition to his work as a composer, Vives was also a prolific writer, penning the librettos for many of his own zarzuelas. He even tried his hand at directing, founding his own company, the Teatro de la Zarzuela, in Madrid. This venture proved successful, with the theater becoming a hub for zarzuela performances and premieres.</p><p>Despite his achievements, Vives faced setbacks in his personal life, including the loss of his wife and the onset of deafness in his later years. Nevertheless, his contributions to Spanish music and theater are widely celebrated, with streets and schools named after him in several cities across Spain.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=7567553" title="Wikipedia article about Amadeu Vives i Roig">Amadeu Vives i Roig on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/chinese-musicians-died-before-turning-18.html' title='Chinese musicians died before turning 18'><strong>Chinese musicians died before turning 18</strong> List of the top 165 Chinese music stars who died before 18</a></li><li><a href='/cambodian-musicians-died-at-age-65.html' title='Cambodian musicians died at age 65'><strong>Cambodian musicians died at age 65</strong> List of the top 3 Cambodian music stars who died when they were 65</a></li><li><a href='/american-musicians-born-in-1990.html' title='American musicians born in 1990'><strong>American musicians born in 1990</strong> List of the top 50 American  music stars who died in who were born in 1990</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/brazilian-musicians-died-before-turning-18.html' title='Brazilian musicians died before turning 18'><strong>Brazilian musicians died before turning 18</strong> List of the top 38 Brazilian music stars who died before 18</a></li><li><a href='/cuban-musicians-died-before-turning-21.html' title='Cuban musicians died before turning 21'><strong>Cuban musicians died before turning 21</strong> List of the top 9 Cuban music stars who died before 21</a></li><li><a href='/costa-rican-musicians-died-at-age-80.html' title='Costa Rican musicians died at age 80'><strong>Costa Rican musicians died at age 80</strong> List of the top 1 Costa Rican music stars who died when they were 80</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
