(July 20, 1304		Arezzo-July 19, 1374			Arquà Petrarca)

	
		also known as Francesco Petrarca, Petrarca, Francesco or Francesco Petrarch

	
was
an Italian
writer, mountaineer and poet.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Giovanni and Francesca.

						</p><p>Petrarch is often referred to as the "Father of Humanism" as his works helped to inspire the Renaissance, which saw a renewed interest in classical learning and culture. His most famous work is the collection of sonnets entitled "Canzoniere" or "Rime," which he wrote in the Tuscan dialect. He also wrote extensively in Latin, including letters, speeches, and essays. </p><p>In addition to his writing, Petrarch was an accomplished scholar and was appointed as a papal envoy to Rome. He also had a love for mountaineering and is known for his climb of Mont Ventoux in 1336, which he wrote about in a letter to his friend. </p><p>Throughout his life, Petrarch had a deep longing for the idealized love of a woman named Laura, who he first saw when he was 23 years old. She is the subject of many of his poems and is considered to be one of his greatest muses. </p><p>Petrarch's legacy continues to influence literature and thought today, particularly through his emphasis on individualism, love, and the importance of human emotions.</p><p>In addition to his literary and scholarly pursuits, Petrarch was also a significant figure in the Catholic Church. He was a devout Christian and his writings often reflected his spiritual beliefs. He was even offered an appointment as a bishop, though he declined the position. Petrarch's influence on the Church is also evident in his promotion of the idea of the "Babylonian Captivity" of the Papacy, which referred to the period of time when the papacy was located in Avignon, France rather than Rome. Petrarch believed that the papacy should return to Rome, and his advocacy helped to pave the way for the eventual return of the papacy to the city.</p><p>Petrarch's impact on the Renaissance was significant, and he is often seen as a key figure in the development of humanism. His emphasis on the importance of the individual, the value of learning and culture, and the power of human emotions helped to shape the intellectual and cultural landscape of Europe. His works inspired many Renaissance writers and thinkers, including Boccaccio, Dante, and Shakespeare, and his legacy can still be felt in literature and philosophy today. Petrarch died in 1374 at the age of 69 and was buried in the Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Arquà Petrarca, where his tomb can still be visited today.</p><p></p><p>
