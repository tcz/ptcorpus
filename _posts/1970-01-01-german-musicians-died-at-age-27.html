a German
philosopher.


					</p><p>He studied theology and philosophy at the University of Jena and later worked as a private tutor. Abbt gained recognition for his works such as "Vom Tode fürs Vaterland" (On Death for the Fatherland) which was a response to the Seven Years War. He argued that dying for one's country is a moral duty and a way to achieve immortality. Abbt also published "Versuch einer neuen Theorie des menschlichen Vorstellungsvermögens" (Essay on a New Theory of the Human Capacity for Representation) in which he proposed a theory of perception based on Leibnizian monadology. Abbt died at the young age of 28 from tuberculosis. However, his writings had a great influence on thinkers such as Immanuel Kant and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.</p><p>Abbt's works were widely regarded as thought-provoking and advanced for their time. His "Versuch einer neuen Theorie des menschlichen Vorstellungsvermögens" was significant in its challenge to the dominant ideas of the time surrounding perception and representation. Abbt also published "Vom Verdienste," which discusses the concept of merit and how it contributes to a just society. In addition to his philosophical works, Abbt translated English poetry into German and was known for his literary pursuits. His life and work were cut short due to his battle with tuberculosis, which plagued him throughout his short adult life. Despite his relatively short career, Abbt contributed significantly to the field of philosophy and continues to be studied and appreciated today.</p><p>Abbt's "Vom Tode fürs Vaterland" also had a significant impact on German nationalism and the idea of sacrifice for the greater good. He argued that sacrificing oneself for the country would make one immortal in the eyes of future generations. This idea resonated with many young Germans and helped fuel a growing sense of patriotism and loyalty to their country. Additionally, Abbt was a supporter of the Enlightenment and the idea that reason and education could improve society. He believed that individuals had the ability and responsibility to question authority and create a more just and equitable society. Despite his short life, Abbt's ideas and influence continue to be studied and discussed in academic circles today.</p><p></p><p>

(April 8, 1695		Strzegom-March 15, 1723			Jena)

	
		also known as Johann Christian Gunther, Günther, Johann Christian, J.C. Guenther or Guenther, J. C.

	
was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Johann Christian Günther was a prolific poet and one of the most significant German lyric poets of the early 18th century. Despite his untimely death at the age of 28, he managed to produce an impressive body of work that includes more than 800 poems. Günther's poetry was characterized by its emotional depth and introspective nature, and he was particularly skilled in depicting the joys and sorrows of love. His works were widely admired by his contemporaries and have continued to be studied and appreciated by scholars of German literature to this day. Despite his relatively short life, Günther's contributions to German poetry have cemented his legacy as a major figure in the country's literary history.</p><p>In addition to his poetry, Johann Christian Günther was also a translator and a playwright. He translated works by Roman poet Ovid and French playwright Molière into German, and wrote several plays of his own, including a tragedy titled "Der verliebte und wütende Aeneas" (The In Love and Furious Aeneas).</p><p>Günther was born in Silesia, which was then part of the Kingdom of Prussia, and studied at the universities of Leipzig and Jena. He suffered from poor health throughout his life, and his fragile constitution was likely weakened by his studies and his intense writing schedule.</p><p>Despite his early death, Günther's influence on German literature was significant. He was often cited as an inspiration by later poets, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, and his focus on personal emotion and inner experience foreshadowed the Romantic movement that would emerge in Germany later in the 18th century.</p><p>Günther's upbringing was marked by tragedy, as his parents died when he was young, leaving him and his siblings to be raised by their grandparents. It was his grandfather who introduced him to literature and sparked his love of poetry.</p><p>Günther's first collection of poems was published in 1717, when he was just 22 years old. The collection was a critical and commercial success, and Günther quickly gained a reputation as one of the foremost poets of his generation.</p><p>Günther's poetry was often deeply personal, dealing with his own experiences of love, loss, and longing. His work was marked by a sensitivity to the natural world, and he often used natural imagery to explore his own emotions.</p><p>Despite his success as a poet, Günther struggled with poverty throughout his life. He relied on the support of patrons to finance his writing, and was never able to achieve financial independence. His early death was a tragic loss to German literature, and many mourned the loss of a great talent cut down in his prime.</p><p>Today, Günther is remembered as one of the most important poets of his era, a pioneer of German lyric poetry whose work helped to pave the way for the Romantic movement that would follow. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of writers and scholars, and his poetry remains beloved by readers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
