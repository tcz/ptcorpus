						A Retrospective, Karády Katalin: Táncdalok, and A Zsúfolt Társaság are considered classics in Hungarian music history. Karády was a popular performer during the 1930s and 1940s in Hungary, and later gained fame in other parts of Europe. However, her career was cut short due to her alleged collaboration with the Arrow Cross Party during World War II. After the war, she was imprisoned and banned from performing until 1953. Despite this setback, she continued to perform and record music until her emigration to the United States in 1956. In the US, she worked as a nurse and later lived in relative obscurity until her death in 1990. Despite controversy surrounding her political leanings, Karády's talent as a performer continues to be celebrated today.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=23593409" title="Wikipedia article about Katalin Karády">Katalin Karády on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/turkish-musicians-died-at-age-69.html' title='Turkish musicians died at age 69'><strong>Turkish musicians died at age 69</strong> List of the top 5 Turkish music stars who died when they were 69</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-illness.html' title='Famous musicians died in Illness'><strong>Famous musicians died in Illness</strong> List of the top 1 Famous music stars who died in Illness</a></li><li><a href='/egyptian-musicians-died-at-age-68.html' title='Egyptian musicians died at age 68'><strong>Egyptian musicians died at age 68</strong> List of the top 7 Egyptian music stars who died when they were 68</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/mexican-actors-died-in-2005.html' title='Mexican actors died in 2005'><strong>Mexican actors died in 2005</strong> List of the top 4 Mexican actors who died in 2005</a></li><li><a href='/spanish-musicians-died-at-age-34.html' title='Spanish musicians died at age 34'><strong>Spanish musicians died at age 34</strong> List of the top 3 Spanish music stars who died when they were 34</a></li><li><a href='/italian-actresses-died-in-2007.html' title='Italian actresses died in 2007'><strong>Italian actresses died in 2007</strong> List of the top 2 Italian actresses who died in 2007</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
