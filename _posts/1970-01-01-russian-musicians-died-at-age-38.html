He was seen as a divisive figure, with some seeing him as a champion of the working class, while others saw him as a traitor to Lithuanian culture and values.</p><p>After the war, Cvirka was arrested and executed by the new Soviet authorities in 1947. Despite the controversies surrounding his political views, Cvirka's literary contributions continue to be studied and appreciated in Lithuania today.</p><p>Cvirka's writing career was prolific, producing several acclaimed works of fiction, including novels such as "The Seven White Steeds," "The Sons of Heaven," and "The Elephant." He also wrote numerous short stories and essays that addressed issues such as class struggle, poverty, and the oppression of the working class. His writing was known for its realism and attention to detail, capturing the everyday lives of ordinary people in Lithuania.</p><p>Despite his political leanings, Cvirka's work received critical acclaim during his lifetime, winning several literary prizes and earning him recognition as one of the most important Lithuanian writers of the 20th century. Today, his legacy is celebrated in Lithuania through literary awards named after him and by scholars who continue to study and analyze his works.</p><p></p><p>
