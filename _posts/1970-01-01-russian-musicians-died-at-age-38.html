(August 25, 1880		Rome-November 9, 1918			Paris)

	
		also known as Wilhelm Albert Włodzimierz Apolinary Kostrowicki, Guillelmus Apollinaris De Kostrowitzki, Wilhelm Albert Włodzimierz Apollinaris de Wąż-Kostrowicky or Wilhelm Albert Vladimir Apollonaris de Kostrowicki

	
was
a Russian
writer, art critic, poet and playwright.


					</p><p>Apollinaire was born to a Polish mother and an Italian father, but grew up in France. He was interested in poetry from a young age and wrote his first poems in French at the age of 17. Apollinaire's work is known for its avant-garde style and experimentation with form and language, and he is considered a major figure in the development of modernist literature. Some of his most famous works include the poetry collection Alcools and the play The Breasts of Tiresias. Apollinaire was also a champion of the Cubist art movement and was friends with many of its leading figures, including Pablo Picasso. Despite his relatively short life, Apollinaire had a significant impact on the cultural landscape of Paris in the early 20th century.</p><p>The impact of Apollinaire's works and ideas extended far beyond the literary world. He was also deeply involved in the artistic and cultural scene of Paris, where he mingled with some of the most important figures of the time, including James Joyce, Marcel Duchamp, and André Breton. Apollinaire was also a member of the French army during World War I and was wounded in battle. While he initially supported the war, his experiences as a soldier led him to become a vocal critic of the conflict and its devastating effects. He was also known for his love affairs, including with artist Marie Laurencin and writer Colette. Apollinaire's life and works continue to be celebrated and studied by scholars around the world as symbols of the avant-garde movement of the early 20th century.</p><p>Apollinaire's legacy is vast and varied, and he is remembered as a writer who bridged the gap between traditional literature and the avant-garde. His literary innovations, such as calligrammes (poetry in which the words are arranged in a specific shape), challenged conventional ideas about poetry and influenced generations of writers to come. Apollinaire's role in promoting the works of artists like Picasso and Duchamp helped to establish their reputations as important figures in the art world. In addition to his literary and artistic accomplishments, Apollinaire was also an influential music critic, and he is credited with coining the term "surrealism." His contributions to the development of modern art and literature have earned him a place among the most important figures of the early 20th century.</p><p>Apollinaire's death in 1918 was a shock to the cultural world. He was only 38 years old and had already made a significant impact on literature and art. Apollinaire's passing was also mourned by his many friends and lovers, who included prominent figures like Picasso, Laurencin, and Colette, among others. In the years following his death, Apollinaire's works and ideas continued to inspire new generations of artists and writers. His influence can be seen in the works of poets like Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, as well as in the visual art of Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte. Today, Apollinaire is celebrated as a trailblazer who pushed the boundaries of traditional art and literature, paving the way for future innovations and experimentation.</p><p>In addition to his literary and artistic accomplishments, Apollinaire was also a polyglot, fluent in French, Italian, Polish, and Russian. He was known for his ability to move between different cultures and languages, and his experiences living in different countries and speaking multiple languages influenced his writing in powerful ways. Apollinaire was also a prolific letter writer and maintained correspondence with many of his contemporaries, including Gertrude Stein and Henri Rousseau. Some of his letters have been collected and published, providing further insight into his life and ideas. Despite his impact on literary and artistic circles, Apollinaire remains something of an enigmatic figure, and his life and work continue to fascinate scholars and readers alike over a century after his death.</p><p></p><p>

(March 12, 1909		Jurbarkas District Municipality-May 2, 1947			Vilnius)


was
a Russian
personality.


					</p><p>This is incorrect. Petras Cvirka was actually a Lithuanian writer who wrote in Lithuanian language. He was a prominent figure in the Lithuanian literary scene during the first half of the 20th century.</p><p>Cvirka was born in a small village in Lithuania and went on to study law in university. However, he dropped out to pursue a career in writing. His literary works were mainly focused on social issues and depicted the struggles of the working class.</p><p>During the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Cvirka became involved in politics and joined the Communist Party. He was seen as a divisive figure, with some seeing him as a champion of the working class, while others saw him as a traitor to Lithuanian culture and values.</p><p>After the war, Cvirka was arrested and executed by the new Soviet authorities in 1947. Despite the controversies surrounding his political views, Cvirka's literary contributions continue to be studied and appreciated in Lithuania today.</p><p>Cvirka's writing career was prolific, producing several acclaimed works of fiction, including novels such as "The Seven White Steeds," "The Sons of Heaven," and "The Elephant." He also wrote numerous short stories and essays that addressed issues such as class struggle, poverty, and the oppression of the working class. His writing was known for its realism and attention to detail, capturing the everyday lives of ordinary people in Lithuania.</p><p>Despite his political leanings, Cvirka's work received critical acclaim during his lifetime, winning several literary prizes and earning him recognition as one of the most important Lithuanian writers of the 20th century. Today, his legacy is celebrated in Lithuania through literary awards named after him and by scholars who continue to study and analyze his works.</p><p>Cvirka's contributions to Lithuanian literature were significant not just for their literary value, but also for their impact on Lithuanian language itself. In his works, Cvirka incorporated elements of colloquial Lithuanian, making it accessible to a wider audience and helping to establish it as a legitimate literary language.Throughout his career, Cvirka was also involved in journalism, writing articles for newspapers and magazines on political and social issues. He used his platform to promote Communist ideals and advocate for the rights of the working class, often putting him at odds with other Lithuanian writers who saw themselves as defenders of traditional Lithuanian culture despite his popularity among young people and workers.Beyond his literary and political pursuits, Cvirka was known for his personal charm and sociability. He had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, including other prominent writers and intellectuals of his time. Today, he is remembered not just for his literary contributions, but also for his impact on Lithuanian society and culture as a whole.</p><p>Cvirka was also instrumental in the formation of the Lithuanian Writers' Union, serving as one of its founding members and as its first chairman. The union played an important role in promoting and preserving Lithuanian literature, particularly during the Soviet era when many writers were persecuted for their political beliefs.When Cvirka was arrested and executed by Soviet authorities in 1947, his death was seen as a great loss to the world of literature and to Lithuanian culture. Despite this, his legacy and influence continue to inspire new generations of writers and thinkers in Lithuania today.</p><p>In addition to his literary and political pursuits, Petras Cvirka was also a translator, translating works by Russian and foreign authors into Lithuanian. He was a champion of Soviet literature and believed that it had the power to inspire and educate the masses. Cvirka's translations helped to introduce Lithuanian readers to new literary styles and ideas from around the world, further bolstering the development of Lithuanian literature as a whole.Cvirka's early works were influenced by the Lithuanian national revival, but as his political views shifted, his writing became more focused on Marxist ideology. Despite this shift, Cvirka continued to be praised for his ability to capture the nuances of everyday Lithuanian life in his writing, no matter the political leanings behind it. Today, he is remembered as a complex figure, whose literary contributions and political views continue to be debated and analyzed in Lithuania and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
