(January 8, 1925		Amritsar-January 3, 1972			Delhi)


was
an Indian
writer and playwright.


					</p><p>He was one of the pioneers of the Indian theatre movement in the 1950s and 1960s, and his work is regarded as a landmark in the history of modern Indian theatre. Rakesh's plays, which were known for their innovative themes and use of language, explored a range of social and political issues such as identity, power, and exploitation. Some of his most famous plays include "Ashadh Ka Ek Din", "Adhe Adhure", and "Leheron Ke Rajhans". In addition to being a playwright, Rakesh was also a well-regarded novelist and essayist, and his works have been translated into numerous languages. He was a recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, India's highest honour for theatre artists.</p><p>Rakesh was born into a Punjabi family in 1925 and grew up in Lahore, Pakistan. He studied at the Government College University in Lahore before moving to Delhi in 1948. In Delhi, he worked as a writer and editor for several newspapers and magazines, including Current, Blitz, and Saptahik Hindustan. Rakesh's literary career began with the publication of his first novel, "Na Aane Wala Kal" in 1954. He soon turned to playwriting, and his first play "Ashadh Ka Ek Din" was staged in 1958 to critical acclaim. </p><p>Rakesh's plays were known for their psychological depth and realism, and he was often compared to playwrights like Ibsen and Chekhov. His characters were complex and multifaceted, and he explored their internal struggles with great sensitivity. "Adhe Adhure", one of his most famous plays, is a searing exploration of a dysfunctional family and the power dynamics within it. The play's themes of gender roles and patriarchy are just as relevant today as they were in the 1960s. </p><p>Rakesh was also interested in the intersection of theatre and politics, and he was associated with the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA) for many years. He believed that theatre had the potential to spark social change and bring about political awakening. His plays often tackled themes of social injustice and inequality, and he was deeply committed to creating a more just and equitable society. </p><p>Despite his contributions to Indian theatre and literature, Rakesh's work remains relatively unknown outside of academic circles. However, his legacy lives on, and he continues to be regarded as one of the most important playwrights in the history of modern Indian theatre.</p><p></p><p>
