									</h1><p>Here are 3 famous musicians from Austria died at 27:</p><h2>Georg Trakl</h2><p><strong>Georg Trakl</strong>
(February 3, 1887		Salzburg-November 3, 1914			Kraków)

	
		also known as Trakl, Georg

	
was
an Austrian
writer, pharmacist and poet.


					</p><p>Trakl is considered one of the most important poets of Expressionism in German literature. His poetry often explored themes of death, decay, and existential anxiety, which may have influenced his struggles with addiction and mental health. Despite only living to the age of 27, Trakl left behind a significant body of work, including two poetry collections, "Gedichte" and "Sebastian im Traum," as well as several prose pieces. His poetic style, characterized by its musicality and vivid imagery, continues to inspire and captivate readers to this day.</p><p>Trakl's childhood was marked by familial instability due to his parents' troubled marriage and his father's alcoholism. As a result, he and his siblings spent much of their time with their grandparents, who instilled in Trakl a love for literature and music. Trakl went on to study pharmacy in Vienna and worked as a pharmacist throughout his adult life. His job as a pharmacist, however, often served as a source of financial stability but also contributed to his addiction to morphine. </p><p>During World War I, Trakl served as a medic on the Eastern front, an experience that deeply affected him and his writing. His poetry reflected the horrors of war and the tragedy of human suffering. Despite his brief career, Trakl's influence on German Expressionism and subsequent generations of poets has been immense. His work has been translated into numerous languages and continues to be appreciated for its haunting beauty and deep emotional resonance.</p><p>Trakl's poetry was not immediately recognized during his lifetime, and it was not until the 1920s that his work gained widespread critical acclaim. Today, he is considered one of the most significant poets of the early 20th century, with his work having a profound impact on German poetry and on European literature as a whole. Trakl's influence can be seen in the works of a number of other poets, including Paul Celan and Rainer Maria Rilke. Trakl's life and tragic death have also been the subject of numerous works of literature and film, attesting to the enduring interest in his life and work.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of drug overdose.

(August 19, 1886		Altaussee-October 3, 1913)


was
an Austrian
mountaineer.


					</p><p>Paul Preuss was considered as one of the greatest climbers of his time due to his pioneering techniques that revolutionized the sport of climbing. He was known for his bold and innovative style, which involved climbing without using any artificial aids such as pitons or ropes. His "free solo" climbing technique was largely unknown and untested at the time, but Preuss became famous for using this technique on some of the most challenging peaks in the Alps.</p><p>Preuss' death was a tragic consequence of his adventurous spirit. On October 3, 1913, he attempted to climb the North Ridge of the Mandlkogel in Austria's Dachstein massif without a rope. His body was later found at the base of the mountain, indicating that he had fallen during the climb. Despite his untimely death, Preuss' contributions to the sport of mountaineering continued to influence and inspire climbers for decades to come. Today, he is remembered as a pioneer of free solo climbing and a true legend of the sport.</p><p>Preuss' early years were spent in a mountainous region in Austria, where his love for climbing was developed. He began his mountaineering career at the age of 16 and immediately became known for his natural ability and daring techniques. Preuss' style of climbing was different from his contemporaries as he did not use any tools, relying solely on his strength, skill and judgment. He was known for his intense focus and calm demeanor, even under the most challenging circumstances.</p><p>Preuss' reputation as a skilled climber grew, and he began making first ascents of several difficult peaks in the Alps. He made his mark in 1911 when he climbed the notorious Totenkirchl, an overhanging limestone cliff in Austria, using only his hands and feet. This climb became famous for its difficulty and is still considered a masterpiece in the world of climbing.</p><p>Preuss' impact on the sport of mountaineering was not only on his technique, but also on his philosophy. He was a proponent of the "pure" climbing style, which emphasized the importance of relying on one's own strength and ability while climbing, instead of using artificial tools. Preuss believed this approach led to a deeper connection with the mountain and a more authentic experience.</p><p>Despite his tragic death, Paul Preuss' legacy lives on. His bold and innovative style continues to inspire climbers around the world, and his influence on the sport of mountaineering cannot be overstated. He remains one of the most legendary figures in the history of climbing.</p><p>Preuss' death was a significant event in the climbing community of the time, and his legacy has continued to impact the sport in the years since. His innovative "free solo" technique, which involved climbing without ropes or gear, was a groundbreaking development in the field of mountaineering, and one that would go on to inspire generations of climbers.</p><p>In addition to his pioneering approach to climbing, Preuss was also known for his writing and advocacy work. He was a vocal proponent of "pure" climbing, and he argued that the use of artificial tools and aids undermined the essence of the sport. He also wrote extensively on his experiences as a climber, and his works continue to be studied and admired today.</p><p>Despite his short career as a climber, Preuss left an indelible mark on the sport, and his legacy continues to inspire climbers to push the boundaries of what is possible on the world's most challenging peaks.</p><p></p><p>
