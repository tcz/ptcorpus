(May 15, 1911		Cologne-January 24, 1978			Linz am Rhein)

	
		also known as Dr. Herta Oberheuser

	
was
a German
physician.


					</p><p>During World War II, she worked as a physician at the Ravensbrück concentration camp. While there, Oberheuser conducted medical experiments on prisoners, including injecting them with gasoline and deliberately inflicting wounds to study the effectiveness of various treatments. She was one of several doctors who were tried during the Doctors' Trial in Nuremberg for crimes against humanity. Oberheuser was sentenced to 20 years in prison, but was released after serving only 5 years. After her release, she resumed her career as a physician under a different name, but was eventually exposed and stripped of her medical license. Oberheuser died in 1978 at the age of 66.</p><p>During her time as a physician at Ravensbrück concentration camp, Oberheuser was responsible for selecting victims for medical experiments, which included injecting various substances into their muscles and testing ways to treat infections. In one particularly gruesome series of experiments, Oberheuser deselected healthy organs from live prisoners without anesthesia, resulting in extreme pain and often death for the victim. Despite having medical knowledge, Oberheuser's actions and gross violations of basic ethics demonstrated severe moral corruption.</p><p>After her release from prison, Oberheuser worked as a physician under a different name at a clinic in Germany. Eventually, however, she was recognized by a former Ravensbrück inmate and was exposed. She lost her medical license permanently and was ostracized by the medical community.</p><p>Oberheuser's legacy is one of cruelty and inhumanity, as well as a reminder of the dangers of blind obedience to authority and the ethical responsibilities of individuals in positions of power.</p><p>Oberheuser was born into a wealthy family in Cologne, Germany. She attended medical school at the University of Bonn, where she was one of only a few female students. After completing her studies, she married and had two children.</p><p>During World War II, Oberheuser was recruited by the Nazi party to work at Ravensbrück concentration camp as part of their efforts to conduct medical experiments on prisoners. Despite the horrors that she witnessed and took part in, she claimed during her trial that she was simply following orders and had no choice but to comply.</p><p>After her release from prison, Oberheuser struggled to find work as a physician due to her reputation. She changed her name and began working at a clinic in Germany, but was eventually recognized by a former inmate and confronted with her past. This led to her being stripped of her medical license and her reputation being irreparably damaged.</p><p>Despite her role in the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, Oberheuser remained largely unrepentant until her death. In interviews conducted later in her life, she continued to claim that she was merely following orders and that she had no choice but to participate in the experiments at Ravensbrück.</p><p>Today, Oberheuser's legacy serves as a powerful reminder of the dangers of unchecked authority and the importance of remaining vigilant against those who would use their positions of power to commit unspeakable acts of cruelty.</p><p>Despite her attempts to evade responsibility for her actions, there is evidence that Oberheuser actively participated in the horrific experiments conducted at Ravensbrück. Testimony from survivors and other witnesses at the Doctors' Trial described her as a cruel and sadistic doctor who took pleasure in inflicting pain on her victims. Additionally, documents uncovered after the war revealed that she actively sought to expand the scope of the experiments she conducted, suggesting that she was not simply following orders but was an active participant in the atrocities committed at the camp.</p><p>Oberheuser's case highlights the fact that even highly educated and trained professionals can become complicit in acts of extreme cruelty when placed in a system that values obedience over morality. Her legacy is a solemn reminder of the moral responsibilities of individuals in positions of authority and the importance of speaking out against injustice and oppression.</p><p></p><p>

		Gerda Buch.

						</p><p>Walter Buch was a German politician, who served as a member of the Nazi Party and a member of the Reichstag during the Nazi regime in Germany. He was also a member of the SS and worked as a police officer in the occupied territories during World War II. After the war, Buch was arrested and charged with war crimes, but he committed suicide before his trial could begin. Despite his controversial political past, Buch is still remembered as a prominent figure in German history.</p><p>During his time as a politician, Buch was known for being a loyal follower of Adolf Hitler and his ideology. He was particularly interested in the field of economics and played a role in developing policies that would help support the German economy. Buch's position in the SS and as a police officer in occupied territories meant that he was involved in the implementation of Nazi policies, including the persecution and extermination of Jews and other marginalized groups.</p><p>After the war, Buch was arrested by Allied forces and charged with war crimes. He was set to stand trial at Nuremberg, but committed suicide by hanging himself in his cell before the trial began. The circumstances of his death have been the subject of some debate, with some suggesting that he may have been assisted in his suicide by sympathetic guards.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Buch is still significant in German history as a symbol of the country's dark past. His story serves as a reminder of the atrocities committed under Nazi rule and the importance of holding individuals accountable for their actions.</p><p>Walter Buch had an early interest in politics and became a member of the German National People's Party (DNVP) in the early 1920s. However, he soon became disillusioned with the party and joined the Nazi Party in 1925. Buch quickly rose through the ranks of the party, and by 1928 he was a member of the Reichstag, the German parliament.</p><p>During the 1930s, Buch played an important role in the development of the Nazi regime's economic policies. He was a proponent of autarky, or economic self-sufficiency, and worked on plans to increase domestic production and reduce imports. He also helped to create policies that would support the growth of small businesses and agriculture.</p><p>In 1942, Buch was appointed as the SS and Police Leader for Belarus, where he was involved in the implementation of the Nazi's policies of repression and extermination. He oversaw the creation of ghettos and the transport of Jews to extermination camps. Buch was also involved in the suppression of partisan activity in the region, and his forces were responsible for numerous atrocities against civilians.</p><p>Buch was arrested by Allied forces in May 1945 and charged with war crimes, including crimes against humanity. He is believed to have committed suicide in his cell at Nuremberg Prison on November 12, 1949, just days before his trial was due to begin.</p><p>After Walter Buch's death, his daughter Gerda Buch became a controversial figure in her own right. Gerda Buch was born in 1929 and spent her childhood in Nazi Germany. She was raised by her mother after her parents divorced in the mid-1930s, and she later wrote about her upbringing in a memoir titled "Mein Vater, der NS-Verbrecher" ("My Father, the Nazi Criminal").</p><p>Gerda Buch's book caused controversy when it was published in 1984, as it portrayed her father as a loving and caring parent rather than the war criminal he was known to be. She also attempted to downplay his role in the Nazi regime and the atrocities he was involved in, leading some to accuse her of veering towards Holocaust denial.</p><p>Despite the criticism she received for her book and her defense of her father's actions, Gerda Buch was never charged with any crimes. She died in 2017 at the age of 87.</p><p></p><p>

(July 28, 1904		Pristina-December 21, 1970			Munich)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Actually, Elyesa Bazna was a famous Albanian spy who worked for the German intelligence during World War II. He was born on July 28, 1904, in Pristina, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire (now in Kosovo). He got his start in espionage through his work as a valet to the British ambassador in Ankara. </p><p>In 1941, Bazna was recruited by the German intelligence service, the Abwehr, and was given the code name Cicero. He was tasked with infiltrating the British embassy in Ankara and transmitting secret documents to the Germans. Bazna was successful in his mission, providing the Nazis with valuable information that helped their war effort. </p><p>Bazna's spying career was short-lived, however. In 1944, a British agent named Kim Philby discovered Bazna's identity and confronted him. Bazna fled to Germany, where he was debriefed by the Germans and awarded the Iron Cross, but was also accused of embezzling money from the Abwehr. After the war, Bazna lived in poverty and obscurity, until his death in Munich on December 21, 1970.</p><p>Following the end of the war, Bazna tried to profit from his infamous past by selling his memoirs but it was met with little success. Many historians dispute the actual value of the information he was able to provide. The story of Cicero was later turned into a popular movie entitled "Five Fingers" starring James Mason. It is still debated whether Bazna acted mainly out of self-interest or whether he truly believed in the German cause. Nevertheless, his role during the war remains a fascinating and controversial part of World War II history.</p><p>Bazna's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. After his father's death, he had to leave school and start working to support his family. He worked various jobs before eventually finding employment as a valet, which served as his entry point into the world of espionage.</p><p>Bazna's success as a spy was largely due to his charm and intelligence. He was able to ingratiate himself with British embassy officials, gaining access to secret documents that he then transmitted to his German handlers. He was paid a handsome sum for his services, which allowed him to enjoy a luxurious lifestyle.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his actions, Bazna remained unrepentant until the end of his life. He often boasted about his exploits, claiming that he had acted out of a desire for personal gain rather than any ideological convictions.</p><p>Today, Bazna is remembered as one of the most successful spies of World War II, and his story continues to fascinate and intrigue historians and the general public alike.</p><p>However, the legacy of Elyesa Bazna also highlights the complex role of individuals caught up in the tumultuous events of war. While his actions were undoubtedly harmful to the British war effort, the circumstances that led him to become a spy were shaped by the political and social realities of his time. Additionally, Bazna's story sheds light on the role of ethnic minorities in the conflict, as he was one of a number of Albanians who found themselves caught up in the machinations of global powers during the war. Ultimately, Bazna's life and legacy can be seen as a reminder of the complicated and often tragic human stories that underpin history's grand narratives.</p><p></p><p>
