						Born into a musical family, Stravinsky began piano lessons at a young age and later studied law and philosophy at the University of Saint Petersburg. He started his career as a composer by creating music for the Ballets Russes, a famous ballet company, and gained international fame with his ballet scores for The Firebird, Petrushka, and The Rite of Spring, which caused a scandal at its premiere in Paris in 1913.</p><p>Stravinsky continued to experiment with new and innovative forms, including neoclassicism and serialism, and produced some of the most iconic works of 20th-century classical music. He also collaborated with artists of various disciplines, such as Pablo Picasso, Coco Chanel, and Sergei Diaghilev.</p><p>Following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, Stravinsky moved to Switzerland and later settled in the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1945. He continued to compose until the end of his life and was recognized with numerous awards and honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=38172" title="Wikipedia article about Igor Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/norwegian-actors-died-at-age-76.html' title='Norwegian actors died at age 76'><strong>Norwegian actors died at age 76</strong> List of the top 6 Norwegian actors who died when they were 76</a></li><li><a href='/russian-musicians-died-in-colorectal-cancer.html' title='Russian musicians died in Colorectal cancer'><strong>Russian musicians died in Colorectal cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Russian music stars who died in Colorectal cancer</a></li><li><a href='/cuban-actors-died-in-1993.html' title='Cuban actors died in 1993'><strong>Cuban actors died in 1993</strong> List of the top 1 Cuban actors who died in 1993</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/italian-actors-died-in-1973.html' title='Italian actors died in 1973'><strong>Italian actors died in 1973</strong> List of the top 2 Italian actors who died in 1973</a></li><li><a href='/polish-musicians-died-at-age-54.html' title='Polish musicians died at age 54'><strong>Polish musicians died at age 54</strong> List of the top 14 Polish music stars who died when they were 54</a></li><li><a href='/pakistani-musicians-died-in-disease.html' title='Pakistani musicians died in Disease'><strong>Pakistani musicians died in Disease</strong> List of the top 1 Pakistani music stars who died in Disease</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
