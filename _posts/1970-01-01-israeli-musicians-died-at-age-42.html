		also known as Haim G. Ginzburg or Haim G. Ginott

	
was
an Israeli
psychologist and psychotherapist.


					</p><p>He was best known for his pioneering work in the field of child psychology and his book "Between Parent and Child," which became a best-seller and was translated into more than 30 languages. Ginott's approach emphasized compassionate communication and focused on helping parents and educators understand the emotional needs of children. He believed that confrontation and punishment were ineffective strategies for change and that empathy and understanding were the keys to building healthy, positive relationships. In addition to his contributions to psychology, Ginott was also a renowned teacher and lecturer, and his ideas continue to influence parents, educators, and therapists around the world.</p><p>Ginott was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, on August 5, 1922, and served in the British Army during World War II before attending the University of Jerusalem. After earning his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Columbia in 1952, he began his career as a therapist and educator. Ginott's approach to child psychology was revolutionary for his time, as it emphasized treating children with respect and understanding, rather than punishment or judgment. He believed that the language parents and educators used with children was crucial to their emotional development and advocated for using "I" messages to express feelings and needs, rather than "you" messages that could alienate children. Ginott's legacy continues to influence modern approaches to child-rearing and education, and his work remains essential reading for parents, therapists, and educators around the world.</p><p></p><p>
