Zirakzadeh was a member of the National Front and played an instrumental role in organizing protests against the Shah's regime.</p><p>After the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Zirakzadeh became disillusioned with the new government and joined the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK) opposition group.

In 1983, he was appointed to the MEK's Central Committee and played a key role in the group's military operations. However, he became disillusioned with the MEK's tactics and leadership in the late 1980s and was ultimately expelled from the group in 1990.</p><p>After leaving the MEK, Zirakzadeh remained active in opposition politics through his involvement with the National Democratic Front, a pro-democracy organization.

He was a key organizer of the 1978 protests that eventually led to the fall of the Shah's regime. However, he was also critical of the Islamic Republic that emerged in the aftermath of the revolution, arguing that it did not represent the democratic principles that he and his fellow activists had fought for.</p><p>Zirakzadeh's time with the MEK was marked by both success and controversy. On the one hand, he played a significant role in the group's military operations against the Islamic Republic, which included bombings and assassinations of government officials. On the other hand, he was critical of the group's cult-like behavior and authoritarian leadership, particularly during the group's exile in France. Zirakzadeh was eventually expelled from the MEK in 1990 for his open criticism of the group's leadership.</p><p>Despite his criticism of the Islamic Republic and the MEK, Zirakzadeh remained popular among Iranian opposition groups due to his unwavering commitment to democracy and human rights.
