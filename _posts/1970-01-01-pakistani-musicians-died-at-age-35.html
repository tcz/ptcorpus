(April 5, 1974		Bannu District-August 5, 2009			South Waziristan)


was
a Pakistani
warlord.


					</p><p>Baitullah Mehsud was the founder and leader of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, a militant group that has been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and suicide bombings in Pakistan. He was known for his fierce opposition to the Pakistani government and his close ties to Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda. Mehsud was born in the Bannu District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and belonged to the Mehsud tribe. He received little formal education and rose to prominence as a militant leader during the Afghan War. Over the years, he was accused of masterminding a number of high-profile attacks, including the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Despite his notoriety, Mehsud remained an elusive target for Pakistani and American forces for many years before ultimately succumbing to illness in 2009.</p><p>Mehsud began his militant career in the late 1990s when he formed a group to fight against the Taliban. However, he later joined the Taliban and became an ally of Mullah Omar. After the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, Mehsud fled to Pakistan and began to build his own militant group, which eventually became the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The TTP aimed to establish a strict Islamic state in Pakistan and carried out attacks against both Pakistani military and civilian targets.</p><p>Mehsud was known for his charismatic personality and his ability to inspire loyalty among his followers. He also had a reputation for being ruthless, and was accused of ordering the execution of opponents and suspected informants. Despite his notoriety, he remained a popular figure among some Pashtuns in Pakistan, who saw him as a resistance leader fighting against the Pakistani government and its US allies.</p><p>Mehsud's death was seen as a significant blow to the TTP, although the group continued to carry out attacks in Pakistan for many years afterwards. His successor, Hakimullah Mehsud, was also killed in a US drone strike in 2013. Today, the TTP remains a potent force in Pakistan, although it has been weakened by infighting and the loss of many of its senior leaders.</p><p>Mehsud was also known for his involvement in the opium trade, which he used to finance his militant activities. He controlled a major portion of the opium trade in the tribal regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and his group levied taxes on opium farmers and drug smugglers. The TTP's involvement in the drug trade helped to fuel their insurgency and undermine the stability of the region.Mehsud's death was controversial, with some conspiracy theories suggesting that he was actually killed by a rival group or elements within the Pakistani government. However, the US government officially confirmed that Mehsud was killed in a drone strike in South Waziristan on August 5, 2009. His death was welcomed by the Pakistani government and the US, which saw him as one of the most dangerous terrorists in the region. Nonetheless, his legacy continues to be felt in Pakistan, where the TTP and other militant groups continue to carry out attacks and destabilize the country.</p><p>In addition to his involvement with the Taliban and the TTP, Baitullah Mehsud was also known for his role in supporting other militant groups in the region. He provided financial and material support to groups like the Haqqani network and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which have carried out attacks in Afghanistan and India, respectively. Mehsud was also believed to have close ties to the Pakistani intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which some experts have suggested may have given him protection in exchange for his support of their strategic goals.</p><p>Mehsud's death was seen as a significant milestone in the fight against terrorism in Pakistan, and it marked a major victory for the US drone program, which had been criticized for its controversial use of targeted killings. However, his death also highlighted the challenges of dealing with militant groups that operate across borders and have deep roots within local communities. The TTP and its affiliated groups have continued to carry out attacks in Pakistan, and the country remains one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists, activists, and religious minorities.</p><p>Despite his notorious reputation as a ruthless militant leader, Baitullah Mehsud was also known for his philanthropic efforts. He established several welfare programs, including schools and hospitals, in the areas under his control. These programs helped to win him support among some locals, who saw him as a leader who was working to improve their lives. Some experts have suggested that Mehsud's charity work was a way of winning hearts and minds, and that it allowed him to maintain his power and influence in the region.</p><p>Mehsud's death in 2009 was followed by a power struggle within the TTP, as various factions vied for control of the group. This infighting weakened the TTP and resulted in a decline in its ability to carry out attacks. However, the group has since reorganized and remains a significant threat to the stability of Pakistan.</p><p>Baitullah Mehsud's legacy remains a controversial one, as some see him as a hero and a freedom fighter, while others view him as a dangerous and brutal terrorist. His life and death are a reminder of the complex and evolving nature of the conflict in Pakistan, and the challenges of combating militant groups that operate across borders and have deep roots within local communities.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of renal failure.
