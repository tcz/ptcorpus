However, Meyer's career was affected by the rise of the Nazi party, and he was forced to leave his position at the Berlin Academy in 1933 due to his Jewish heritage. Meyer spent much of the following years in exile, living and working in various countries, including the United States, before returning to East Germany in 1949.</p><p>Throughout his long and distinguished career, Meyer made significant contributions to the study and understanding of film music, publishing numerous articles and books on the subject.

Clifford had a distinctive baritone voice that was well-suited to the bawdy and humorous lyrics of many traditional folk songs. He was a regular performer on BBC radio's "The Voices of Walter Fitzgerald" program during the 1950s and 60s. Clifford's most famous songs include "The Foggy Dew," "Botany Bay," and "The Bonny Labouring Boy." He also appeared in several films of the 1940s and 50s, including "The Blue Lagoon" (1949) and "The Black Knight" (1954). Clifford continued to perform and record music throughout his life, and he remained a beloved figure in the English folk music community until his death in 1984.</p><p>In addition to his successful singing career, Grahame Clifford was also a skilled actor. He appeared in numerous theatrical productions throughout his life, including a well-regarded performance in the original West End production of the musical "The Boy Friend" in 1953. Clifford was also a dedicated collector and archivist of traditional folk songs, and his extensive library of recordings and sheet music was later donated to the British Library's National Sound Archive. Despite his fame and success, Clifford remained a humble and down-to-earth figure, always willing to share his knowledge and passion for traditional English music with others. Today, he is remembered as one of the foremost ambassadors of traditional folk music in England and a true pioneer of the genre.</p><p></p><p>
