					</p><p>Fortune was best known for his work on the satirical TV show "Bremner, Bird and Fortune" alongside impressionists Rory Bremner and John Bird. He also appeared in a number of other TV shows, including "The Two Ronnies" and "Only Fools and Horses." In addition to his work in front of the camera, Fortune was an accomplished writer, contributing to a number of publications including Private Eye and The Guardian. His satirical style was often controversial, but he was widely respected for his wit, intellect, and ability to deliver cutting commentary on politics and society. Fortune passed away in 2013 at the age of 74 following a battle with leukemia.</p><p>Born in Bristol in 1939, John Fortune was educated at the prestigious Bristol Grammar School before attending Oxford University, where he studied Classics. He began his career as a drama teacher before transitioning into comedy, performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in the 1960s with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Throughout his career, Fortune received a number of awards for his comedic work, including a BAFTA for his satirical contributions to "Bremner, Bird and Fortune". In addition to his television work, he also appeared in a number of films, including "Match Point" and "The Tailor of Panama". In his personal life, Fortune was married with two children. He was widely regarded as one of the most influential satirists in the UK, paving the way for future generations of comedians and writers.</p><p>Fortune's strong presence in the world of satire was not restricted to television and print media. Along with Bird and Bremner, he also took to the stage for live comedy performances, including several runs at the Edinburgh Fringe. In 2004, the trio elevated their live show to a whole new level, with "The Time of My Life", a staged satire of the life of Prime Minister Tony Blair. The show received rave reviews and toured nationwide.</p><p>Fortune's comedic style was characterized by his sharp intellect and biting wit, which he used to skewer politicians and other public figures. However, he was also a keen observer of everyday life, finding humor in the absurdities of modern society. This broader perspective was reflected in his work for the theater, where he often took on more complex, philosophical topics.</p><p>Despite his success, Fortune was known for his humility and warmth. He was respected by his colleagues and adored by his fans, who praised him for his fearlessness in speaking truth to power. His legacy lives on in the many comedians and writers he inspired, as well as his many memorable performances on screen and stage.</p><p>In addition to his comedic work, John Fortune was also a passionate advocate for social justice and political reform. He was a member of the Labour Party and was particularly vocal about issues such as income inequality, corporate greed, and the erosion of civil liberties. He used his platform as a comedian to raise awareness of these issues, often including political commentary in his performances.</p><p>Fortune's talent and influence were recognized by many in the entertainment industry. In 2006, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement at the British Comedy Awards, and he also received a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2010 for his services to broadcasting. Following his death, many of his peers paid tribute to his groundbreaking work, with former Prime Minister Tony Blair describing him as "a brilliant satirist" who was "never afraid of speaking his mind."</p><p>Despite his passing, John Fortune's legacy continues to inspire comedians and satirists around the world. His unique brand of comedy, which blended sharp wit with social commentary, helped to redefine the genre and influenced generations of future artists.
