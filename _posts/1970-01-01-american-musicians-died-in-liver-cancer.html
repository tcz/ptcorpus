(April 27, 1945		Pittsburgh-October 2, 2005			Seattle)

	
		a.k.a. Frederick August Kittlel Jr., Frederick August Kittel or august_wilson

	
was
an American
playwright, author and screenwriter.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Sakina Ansari and Azula Carmen Wilson.

						</p><p>Wilson is best known for his ten-play series, The Pittsburgh Cycle, which chronicles the African-American experience throughout the 20th century. The cycle includes plays such as Fences, The Piano Lesson, and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. Wilson has won numerous awards for his work, including two Pulitzer Prizes for Drama and a Tony Award for Best Play. In 1999, he was also awarded the National Humanities Medal by the United States government. Wilson's work is celebrated for its raw and emotional portrayal of the African-American experience, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important playwrights of the 20th century.</p><p>In addition to his plays, August Wilson was also a poet, essayist, and short story writer. He grew up in poverty in Pittsburgh's Hill District, which would later serve as the setting for many of his plays. Wilson dropped out of high school but continued to educate himself by spending time in libraries and reading extensively. He also worked a variety of odd jobs, including as a dishwasher, cook, and freelance writer. Wilson credits his experiences growing up in Pittsburgh with shaping his views on race and society, and his work often explores themes of identity, family relationships, and cultural heritage. He passed away in 2005 at the age of 60 from liver cancer, but his impact on American theater continues to be felt today.</p><p>Throughout his career, August Wilson also had a strong influence on other writers and artists. He was a mentor to many aspiring playwrights and founded the August Wilson Monologue Competition, which encourages high school students to explore his work and perform monologues from his plays. In addition, Wilson was involved in the music industry and collaborated with jazz musician Branford Marsalis on a stage production of the play Fences. </p><p>Wilson was also a vocal advocate for African-American representation in the arts and called for greater diversity in theater, film, and television. He believed that African-Americans had a rich cultural legacy that was often overlooked and hoped that his work would help to bring greater awareness to these issues. Today, his plays continue to be performed around the world and have been translated into multiple languages. Wilson's legacy as a writer, activist, and advocate for social justice has had a lasting impact on American theater and culture.</p><p>Wilson's interest in storytelling began at a young age, and he was heavily influenced by the oral tradition of his African-American heritage. He started writing plays in the 1960s but didn't achieve mainstream success until the 1980s with the production of his play Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. From then on, his career took off, and he became a highly recognized and respected voice in American theater.</p><p>Aside from his commercial success, Wilson was also known for his outspokenness and advocacy for Black artists and writers. He was critical of the lack of diversity in American theater and often spoke out about the struggles faced by Black playwrights trying to gain recognition and opportunities in the industry.</p><p>In addition to his numerous awards, Wilson was also posthumously honored with a theater dedicated to his work in Seattle, where he had resided for many years before his death. The August Wilson Theater, located in the historic Paramount Theatre, is a testament to the lasting impact of his contributions to American theater.</p><p></p><p>

was
an American
actor, screenwriter, television producer, television director and film producer.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Ricky Nelson and David Nelson.

						</p><p>Ozzie Nelson was best known for his role as the patriarch in the popular 1950s sitcom, "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet," which also starred his wife, Harriet Nelson, and their real-life sons, Ricky and David. The show ran for over a decade and was one of the longest-running sitcoms in American television history. </p><p>Before his successful career in television, Ozzie was a talented musician and bandleader, leading his own orchestra in the 1930s and 1940s. He also wrote and produced several films, including "Here Come the Nelsons" (1952), which starred his family. </p><p>Ozzie and Harriet Nelson were known as one of Hollywood's happiest and most enduring couples, having been married for over 30 years until Ozzie's passing in 1975 at the age of 69. In addition to his successful entertainment career, Ozzie was a dedicated family man and active in various philanthropic causes throughout his lifetime.</p><p>Ozzie Nelson was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and grew up in Ridgefield Park. He attended Rutgers University on a football scholarship but left before graduating to pursue a career in music. He landed his first job as a saxophonist in a band led by legendary bandleader, Ted Lewis. Ozzie later formed his own orchestra, which became popular with dance enthusiasts across the country. He recorded several hits, including "And Then Some" and "You Are My Lucky Star."</p><p>In the 1940s, Ozzie turned his attention to Hollywood and began working as a screenwriter and film producer. He produced and co-wrote the comedy film, "The Remarkable Andrew" (1942), which starred William Holden. Ozzie also wrote and produced several short films, including "Stone Age Romeos" (1955), which was included in the television series, "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet."</p><p>Ozzie's greatest success, however, came with "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet," which debuted on radio in 1944 and later migrated to television in 1952. The show was a hit with audiences and ran for 14 seasons, making it one of the longest-running shows on American television. The show's success was due in no small part to the Nelsons' real-life chemistry and the fact that the show's storylines often mirrored their own lives. Ozzie played a loving, but somewhat bumbling husband and father, while his wife, Harriet, played a supportive and caring wife and mother. Their sons, Ricky and David, also appeared on the show, first as children and later as teenagers. </p><p>In addition to his work in entertainment, Ozzie was an avid baseball fan and served as a member of the Board of Directors for the Pacific Coast League. He was also actively involved in several charitable organizations, including the American Cancer Society and the March of Dimes. </p><p>Ozzie Nelson's legacy as a beloved television icon and accomplished musician and producer continues to live on today.</p><p>In addition to his work in the entertainment industry and philanthropy, Ozzie Nelson also served in the United States Army during World War II. He enlisted in 1942 and worked as a morale officer, entertaining troops with his music and comedy performances. After his service, he continued to support the military through various events and fundraisers.</p><p>Ozzie and Harriet's real-life marriage was also a notable feature of their television show. The couple often demonstrated a deep love and affection for each other onscreen, which was uncommon for television at the time. This onscreen portrayal of a happy and stable family helped to shape American views on marriage and family life.</p><p>Sadly, Ozzie Nelson passed away in 1975 due to complications from liver cancer. He was survived by his wife, Harriet, and their two sons, Ricky and David. Despite his passing, his legacy as a television pioneer and beloved patriarch remains strong in American pop culture.</p><p>In addition to his successful career in entertainment, Ozzie Nelson was also an accomplished author. He wrote several books, including "Ozzie's Girls" (1960), which chronicled his family and their experiences in show business. The book was a best-seller and gave readers a glimpse into the private lives of the Nelson family. Ozzie was also a talented golfer and enjoyed playing the sport in his spare time.</p><p>After Ozzie's passing, his wife Harriet continued to make appearances on television, including several guest spots on "The Love Boat" and "Fantasy Island." She remained a beloved figure in Hollywood until her own passing in 1994. Their sons, Ricky and David, also followed in their parents' footsteps and pursued successful careers in entertainment.</p><p>Today, "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" remains a cultural touchstone and a testament to the enduring popularity of the traditional family sitcom. Ozzie Nelson's legacy as a talented musician, producer, and writer, as well as his influence on the television industry, continues to be felt to this day.</p><p></p><p>
