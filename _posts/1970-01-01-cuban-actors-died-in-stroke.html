							I'm sorry, but that information is incorrect. José Raúl Capablanca was actually a Cuban chess player and considered by many as one of the greatest players of all time. He became the third World Chess Champion in 1921 and held the title until 1927. Capablanca was known for his natural talent and ability to simplify complicated positions to make them easier to play. He was also a master of the endgame and is said to have rarely made mistakes in this stage of the game. Capablanca was born into a wealthy family in Havana and learned to play chess at a young age. He continued to play competitively throughout his life and was active in promoting the game in both Cuba and the United States. He passed away in 1942 due to a stroke.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=170402" title="Wikipedia article about José Raúl Capablanca">José Raúl Capablanca on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Dámaso Pérez Prado</h2><p><strong>Dámaso Pérez Prado</strong>
