This earned him the Lady Byng Trophy, which is awarded to the most gentlemanly player in the NHL, on four occasions. Apart from hockey, Kelly was a skilled lacrosse player and was a member of the 1951 Canadian Championship team. In 1952, he played for Canada's national lacrosse team in the Summer Olympics held in Helsinki, Finland, where they won a gold medal.
