							</p><p>Zhirinovsky is the founder and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), which he established in 1991. He has been a member of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, since its inception in 1993, and has run for president of Russia six times. </p><p>Zhirinovsky is known for his controversial and often inflammatory statements, which have led to him being called the "court jester of Russian politics" by some. He advocates for a strong, authoritarian government and often speaks out against immigration and minority rights. </p><p>However, Zhirinovsky is also a prolific writer and has authored numerous books on politics, law and history. In addition to his political career, he has also pursued a career in music, releasing several albums of patriotic and folk songs. </p><p>Despite his polarizing views and often confrontational style, Zhirinovsky remains a prominent figure in Russian politics and a symbol of the country's complex political landscape.</p><p>Zhirinovsky was born to a Russian mother and a Tatar father in Almaty, which was then part of the Soviet Union (now Kazakhstan). He studied law at Moscow State University and later worked as a lawyer before transitioning to politics in the late 1980s. </p><p>Zhirinovsky's political career began in 1989 when he founded the Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union, which was one of the first opposition groups allowed to operate in the country. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, he established a new party with the same name in Russia and quickly rose to prominence in the tumultuous political landscape of the post-Soviet era. </p><p>Zhirinovsky has gained notoriety for his often outrageous behavior in parliament, including physical altercations with other members and theatrical speeches. He is known for espousing nationalist and populist views, while also having a complicated relationship with the Kremlin. Despite this, he has been a vocal supporter of President Vladimir Putin and his policies.</p><p>Zhirinovsky's music career began in the 1990s, when he released albums featuring patriotic songs and covers of traditional Russian folk tunes. He has also dabbled in acting, appearing in several films and television shows.</p><p>Despite his polarizing views and actions, Zhirinovsky remains a fixture in the Russian political landscape and a reminder of the complexities of contemporary Russian politics.</p><p>In addition to his involvement in politics, law and music, Zhirinovsky has also been the subject of various controversies throughout his career. He has faced accusations of anti-Semitism, racism and misogyny, and has been criticized for his aggressive and inflammatory rhetoric. In 2014, he faced international condemnation for his comments about Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down over Ukraine, suggesting that Ukrainian authorities were responsible for the tragedy. Zhirinovsky has also been accused of receiving funding from the Kremlin and of being involved with organized crime. Despite these controversies, Zhirinovsky remains a prominent figure in Russian politics, with the LDPR currently holding seats in the State Duma.</p><p>Zhirinovsky's political career has also been marked by several failed attempts to become president of Russia. He first ran for the presidency in 1991, and has since run in every presidential election except for the 2012 race. His best result was in the 1991 election, when he finished third with over 7% of the vote. In the 2018 election, Zhirinovsky received just over 5% of the vote, his lowest result in any presidential race. Despite his failures to win the presidency, Zhirinovsky has remained a vocal and visible presence in Russian politics, and his party continues to hold seats in the State Duma.</p><p>Zhirinovsky's controversial statements and actions have also made him a target of ridicule and parody in Russia, with many comedians and satirists using his image and persona for comedic effect. Despite this, Zhirinovsky remains a serious and influential figure in Russian politics, and his party's support has remained stable despite the changing political climate in the country.</p><p></p><p>
