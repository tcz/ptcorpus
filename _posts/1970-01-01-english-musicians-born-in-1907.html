(February 21, 1907		York-September 29, 1973			Vienna)

	
		otherwise known as W.H. Auden, Wystan Hugh Auden or Auden, W.H.

	
was
an English
librettist, poet, screenwriter, author, composer, writer, playwright and essayist.


						</p><p>Auden is widely regarded as one of the greatest poets of the 20th century. He began his career in the 1930s as a leftist poet, but later turned towards Christianity and conservatism. Some of his notable works include "The Age of Anxiety," "September 1, 1939," and "Funeral Blues," which gained popularity after being featured in the film "Four Weddings and a Funeral." Auden was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1948 and was also appointed as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 1954. He died in Vienna at the age of 66.</p><p>Auden had a highly versatile career, with contributions in various literary forms. He collaborated with composer Benjamin Britten on several musical pieces, including the libretto for the operetta "Paul Bunyan." Auden also wrote extensively for the stage, with his play "The Ascent of F6" co-written with Christopher Isherwood garnering critical acclaim. Additionally, he worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood, contributing to films such as "The Song of Bernadette" and "Nicholas Nickleby." Despite his many accomplishments, Auden struggled with alcoholism throughout his life. He is remembered for his complex and thought-provoking poetry, which explores themes of politics, religion, sexuality, and human nature.</p><p>Auden was born in York, England to George and Constance Auden. He grew up in a middle-class family and was educated at Oxford University, where he became friends with several notable writers and intellectuals, such as Christopher Isherwood and Cecil Day-Lewis. During his time at Oxford, Auden developed a reputation as a witty and intelligent young writer, and his poetry was soon being published in prestigious literary magazines.</p><p>In the 1930s, Auden became associated with a group of leftist writers known as the "Auden Generation." His poetry from this period often deals with social and political themes, as well as existential questions about the meaning of life in a rapidly changing world. However, in 1939 he emigrated to the United States and eventually became a U.S. citizen in 1946. During this time, he underwent a religious conversion and began writing more formal and traditional poetry, often with a Christian perspective.</p><p>Auden's output during this period includes several major works, including "The Double Man," "For the Time Being," and "The Shield of Achilles." He also continued to work in other genres, such as drama and libretto, and collaborated with a number of prominent artists and writers, including Igor Stravinsky, E.M. Forster, and T.S. Eliot. </p><p>Despite his success, Auden struggled with depression and alcoholism throughout his life. He suffered a heart attack in 1972 and died the following year in Vienna, where he had been living with his partner Chester Kallman. Today, he is remembered as one of the most influential and accomplished poets of the 20th century.</p><p></p><p>
