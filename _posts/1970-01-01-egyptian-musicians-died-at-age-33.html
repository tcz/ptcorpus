									</h1><p>Here are 2 famous musicians from Egypt died at 33:</p><h2>Mohammed Helmy</h2><p><strong>Mohammed Helmy</strong>


was
an Egyptian
personality.


					</p><p>Mohammed Helmy was an Egyptian physician who is known for his heroism during World War II. He saved the lives of several Jewish people in Nazi-occupied Germany by providing them with medical care and hiding them from the authorities. Despite the risks to his own life, Helmy refused to reveal the hiding places of those he was helping. He was recognized by Yad Vashem in 2013 as a "Righteous Among the Nations" for his bravery and compassion.</p><p>Mohammed Helmy was born on July 25, 1901, in Khartoum, Sudan, which was then a part of Egypt. He was of Turkish descent and later moved to Germany in the 1920s, where he studied medicine and worked as a physician. During World War II, he converted his own medical office into a hiding place for Jews seeking refuge from the Nazi regime. He also assisted them with obtaining forged identification papers and finding safe places to stay.</p><p>Helmy left Germany in 1959 and returned to Egypt, where he eventually became the head of the Department of Medicine at a hospital in Cairo. Despite his heroic actions during the war, his story remained relatively unknown until the early 2010s when a German researcher uncovered information about his activities and began advocating for him to be recognized for his bravery. Helmy died in 1982 in Cairo, but his legacy lives on as a shining example of selflessness and compassion in the face of great adversity.</p><p></p><p>

(August 14, 1874		Cairo-February 10, 1908)


was
an Egyptian
writer, politician, lawyer, political activist and journalist.


					</p><p>He is mostly known for his efforts in promoting Egyptian independence from British colonialism in the early 20th century. He was one of the founders of the Egyptian Nationalist Party, which advocated for sovereign independence and political autonomy for Egypt. Mustafa Kamil Pasha's political and intellectual contributions earned him several titles such as the "Father of Egyptian Nationalism" and the "Great Leader." In addition to his political activities, Kamil was also an accomplished journalist and a renowned poet. With his eloquence and persuasive writing, he played a significant role in shaping public opinion in Egypt and the Middle East towards independence and freedom. Sadly, he passed away at a young age of 33 due to heart disease, leaving behind a legacy of furthering Egypt's independence and promoting nationalism.</p><p>Kamil was born into an affluent family and received his education in Egypt, before attending law school in France. His exposure to the political atmosphere in Europe inspired him to become an activist for Egypt's independence upon his return to his home country. Along with other prominent figures such as Saad Zaghlul and Muhammad Farid, Kamil played a crucial role in organizing protests and demonstrations against British colonial rule. He founded the newspaper Al-Liwa' (The Banner) in 1892, which became a prominent platform for nationalist thought and activism. </p><p>In addition to his political activities, Kamil was a prolific writer of poetry and prose. He published several collections of poetry, including "Resurrection" and "The Poem of the Nile," which celebrated Egypt's culture and heritage. His essays and articles were also widely circulated and influenced many young Egyptians to join the nationalist cause.</p><p>Kamil's legacy lived on after his death, as his ideas and activism inspired future generations of Egyptian nationalists and anti-colonial activists. In 1919, the Egyptian Nationalist Party, which he helped found, played a key role in the revolution against British occupation, ultimately leading to Egypt's independence in 1922.</p><p>Today, Mustafa Kamil Pasha is widely revered as a national hero and his contributions to Egypt's struggle for independence are celebrated in literature, film, and popular culture.</p><p></p><p>
