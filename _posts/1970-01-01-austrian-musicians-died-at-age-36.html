					</p><p>Horváth was born in the city of Rijeka, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but is now located in Croatia. He grew up in various cities throughout the empire and fell in love with theater at a young age. In 1922, he moved to Berlin and began working as a freelance writer, eventually becoming a successful playwright. </p><p>Horváth's works often focused on the turmoil of interwar Europe and the rise of authoritarianism. He was particularly critical of Nazi Germany and its treatment of Jews and other minorities. Some of his most famous works include "Geschichten aus dem Wiener Wald" (Tales from the Vienna Woods) and "Jugend ohne Gott" (Youth Without God). </p><p>Horváth died tragically in 1938 when he was hit by a falling branch during a thunderstorm in Paris. Despite his brief career, his contributions to literature and theater continue to be celebrated today.</p><p>Horváth was a prolific writer, writing over 20 plays, numerous essays, and several novels throughout his career. He was considered a leading figure in German-language literature during the interwar period. Horváth's writing often dealt with social and political issues of the time, including the rise of fascism, economic instability, and social inequality. He was known for his satirical and critical style, questioning the values and beliefs of contemporary society.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Horváth was also interested in cinema and wrote several screenplays. He was close friends with German film director Max Reinhardt and worked as a scriptwriter for his Berlin-based production company. Horváth's work has been adapted for film and stage productions around the world.</p><p>In recent years, Horváth's legacy has been re-examined, with a renewed interest in his life and work. His works continue to be studied in schools and universities, and his critical views on fascism and authoritarianism have become increasingly relevant in modern times. Horváth's contributions to literature and theater have left a lasting impact on European culture and society.</p><p></p><p>
