(April 5, 2015-April 5, 1991)


was
an Austrian
scientist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his controversial claims of creating a working nuclear fusion reactor in the 1950s, which were later debunked. Richter was born in Austria and studied physics and mathematics at the University of Vienna before obtaining a PhD in nuclear physics from the University of Paris. </p><p>During his career, Richter worked at several research institutions in Austria and Argentina, including the Centro Atómico Bariloche, where he claimed to have built his nuclear fusion reactor. However, his claims were met with skepticism from the scientific community and eventually discredited. </p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his work, Richter continued to pursue research and made contributions to the field of plasma physics. He was honored with various awards throughout his career, including the Order of Merit from Argentina and the Golden Badge of Honor from Austria. Richter passed away in 1991 at the age of 76.</p><p>Richter's claims about creating a nuclear fusion reactor were controversial due to the lack of transparency in his experiments and the absence of peer review. In addition, the results of his experiments could not be replicated by other scientists. Nevertheless, Richter continued his work in nuclear fusion and plasma physics, and in the early 1970s, he built a large plasma device called the Esfera de Plasma. This device was used for research into the behavior of plasma in magnetic fields and contributed to the development of fusion research. </p><p>Apart from his scientific work, Richter was also involved in political activism. He was a member of the Communist Party of Austria and was imprisoned for his political beliefs during the 1930s. Later, he moved to Argentina where he became a citizen and continued his work in nuclear physics. Richter was a controversial figure and remains a subject of interest for those studying the history of nuclear fusion research.</p><p>His life and work have been the subject of a number of books and documentaries, and his legacy continues to be discussed and debated in scientific circles.

(April 3, 1880		Vienna-October 4, 1903			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
writer and philosopher.


					</p><p>Despite his short life, Weininger is best known for his controversial and influential work "Sex and Character," which explores the ideas of gender and sexuality. The work argues that all humans possess both masculine and feminine traits, and claims that the perceived distinctions between genders are artificial constructs perpetuated by society. Weininger's work was met with both acclaim and criticism, and his ideas continue to be debated by scholars to this day. He was also known for his radical views on Judaism and anti-Semitism, which sparked controversy during his lifetime and contributed to his tragic end.</p><p>Weininger's family was Jewish and he converted to Protestantism at the age of 23. His views on Judaism were complex and controversial. In "Sex and Character," Weininger argued that Jews were a "feminine" race and that their perceived feminine qualities were responsible for anti-Semitic prejudice. He saw Judaism as a religion that encouraged a "feminine" way of thinking and viewed Christianity as a religion that emphasized masculine virtues. These views have been widely criticized as misguided and offensive.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his work, Weininger's ideas had a significant impact on 20th-century thought. His ideas on gender and sexuality were influential for early feminists and helped challenge traditional notions of gender roles. Sigmund Freud was also influenced by Weininger's work, particularly his ideas on the duality of human nature. However, many of Weininger's ideas are now criticized for being essentialist and oversimplified.</p><p>In addition to his philosophical and literary work, Otto Weininger was also known for his academic achievements. He studied mathematics and philosophy at the University of Vienna, where he received his PhD at the young age of 21. Despite his intellectual prowess, Weininger struggled with mental health issues and was hospitalized for depression several times throughout his life. </p><p>Weininger's tragic end came at just 23 years old when he died by suicide in his family's apartment in Vienna. The exact reasons for his suicide are unclear, but it is widely believed that his struggles with mental illness, personal and professional disappointments, and societal rejection of his controversial ideas all contributed to his decision. Despite his short life, Otto Weininger's work continues to influence philosophical and cultural movements to this day.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in suicide.

(October 27, 1891-April 19, 1916			Tashkent)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a medical student who was known for his anti-Semitic views and beliefs. During World War I, Braunsteiner joined the Austrian Army and served on the Eastern Front. He was later taken prisoner by the Russian Army and sent to a POW camp in Tashkent, where he died of typhus at the age of 24. Despite his short life, Braunsteiner's legacy continues, as he is often referred to as a precursor to the Nazi ideology that emerged in Austria and Germany in the 1930s. Some historians have also noted his influence on the development of the "Sturmabteilung" or "SA," the Nazi Party's paramilitary organization.</p><p>Additionally, Karl Braunsteiner's personal writings were later discovered and published, providing insight into his extremist views and serving as a source for researchers studying the roots of anti-Semitism in Austria. In recent years, the legacy of Braunsteiner and his connections to Nazi ideology have been the subject of debate and controversy in Austria, particularly in regards to his role in shaping the political landscape of the country in the early 20th century. Overall, Karl Braunsteiner is remembered as a controversial figure in Austrian history whose radical beliefs left a lasting impact on the world.</p><p>Braunsteiner's anti-Semitic views could be traced back to his childhood and adolescence, during which time he was exposed to the writings of anti-Semitic authors, such as Georg von Schönerer and Karl Lueger. His university education, which began in 1911, further fueled his beliefs, as he joined the Pan-Germanic movement, a nationalist and anti-Semitic faction. Braunsteiner's extremist views and his involvement in far-right organizations ultimately led to his arrest in 1914 by the Austrian authorities. He was later released, and he joined the army to fight in World War I.</p><p>After Braunsteiner's death, his writings were seized by the Russian authorities, and some were later published. They outlined his belief in the superiority of the "Aryan" race and his admiration for Adolf Hitler. Many historians consider Braunsteiner to be an important precursor to Nazi ideology in Austria and a key figure in the development of the far-right movement in the country.</p><p>Today, there are ongoing debates about how best to remember Braunsteiner and his legacy in Austria. Some argue that he should be forgotten and that the focus should be on the millions of victims of the Holocaust, which was ultimately perpetrated by the Nazi Party. Others believe that it is important to study figures like Braunsteiner to better understand the roots of anti-Semitism and extremism in Austria and to prevent such views from gaining traction in the future.</p><p></p><p>
