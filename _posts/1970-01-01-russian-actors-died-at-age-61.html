							Mikhail Klimov began his acting career in 1904 as part of the troupe of the Moscow Art Theatre, one of the most influential and innovative theaters in Russia at the time. He quickly gained recognition for his dramatic performances and versatility playing a wide range of roles in plays by Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, and other prominent Russian playwrights. In addition to his work on stage, Klimov also appeared in several early silent films in the early 1910s, including "The Death Ray" (1916), one of the first sci-fi films made in Russia.</p><p>Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, Klimov continued to act in theater and also became involved in the film industry, working as a director and producer. However, his career was cut short by the Stalinist repression in the late 1930s, which led to the arrest and execution of many artists and intellectuals. In 1938, Klimov was arrested and charged with anti-Soviet activities, and was sentenced to ten years in a labor camp. He was released in 1940, but his health had been severely compromised by his imprisonment, and he died two years later in Tbilisi, Georgia. Despite his untimely death, Mikhail Klimov remains an important figure in Russian theater and film history, known for his sensitivity and range as an actor and his contributions to the development of Russian cinema.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=30919201" title="Wikipedia article about Mikhail Klimov">Mikhail Klimov on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Sergo Zakariadze</h2><p><strong>Sergo Zakariadze</strong>
