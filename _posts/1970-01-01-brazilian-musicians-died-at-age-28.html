					</p><p>Torquato Neto played an important role in the Tropicália movement, which was a cultural and artistic movement in Brazil during the late 1960s.

He was part of the Generation of 60, a group of Brazilian poets who sought to renew Brazilian poetry and bring it closer to contemporary international trends. He was also an active participant in the Cinema Novo movement, which sought to make socially engaged and politically committed films that portrayed the realities of life in Brazil.</p><p>Despite his short life, Torquato Neto left behind a significant body of work that continues to influence Brazilian culture and music. Several posthumous collections of his poetry have been published, and his songs have been covered by numerous artists over the years.

					</p><p>Yara Yavelberg was known for her activism and involvement in the Brazilian student movement during the 1960s and early 1970s.

The circumstances of their deaths remain unclear, as the official story provided by the military dictatorship was highly suspect.</p><p>Yara Yavelberg is remembered as a brave and intelligent woman who fought tirelessly for social justice and equality.
