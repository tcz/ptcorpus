He was also a skilled musician and played several instruments.</p><p>Tromp's controversial dismissal from the navy was a result of his feud with his superior officer, Johan de Witt, who accused Tromp of disobeying orders during the Battle of Lowestoft. However, many of his fellow sailors and politicians, including William III of Orange, supported him and believed that he had acted in the best interest of the Dutch navy.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his dismissal, Cornelis Tromp remained a respected and influential figure in Dutch society until his death in 1691.
