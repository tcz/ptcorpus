However, his involvement with the Nazi Party and his role in the war have remained a subject of debate among historians.</p><p>In addition to his military and political activities, Smilo Freiherr von Lüttwitz was also a published author. He wrote several books about his experiences in the military, including "Der Kampf um Berlin" (The Battle for Berlin) and "Durchbruch bei Stalingrad" (Breakthrough at Stalingrad).

Despite his connection to the Nazi regime, von Lüttwitz was known for his intelligence and his ability to adapt to changing circumstances on the battlefield. He was also highly respected by his fellow officers and by the soldiers under his command. Today, von Lüttwitz is remembered as a complex figure whose actions during World War II continue to be debated and studied by historians.</p><p>Moreover, Smilo Freiherr von Lüttwitz was also involved in the failed plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler in July 1944. Although he was not one of the ringleaders of the plot, he did offer his support and allowed some of the key conspirators to use his headquarters in Berlin as a base of operations. As a result of his involvement, von Lüttwitz was arrested and later sentenced to death. However, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after the war. In prison, von Lüttwitz remained defiant and unrepentant about his involvement in the plot, stating that it had been his duty as a soldier to try and overthrow Hitler before he could do any more damage to Germany. Despite his controversial actions, von Lüttwitz was known for his bravery and leadership both on and off the battlefield, and his legacy remains a complex and multifaceted one.</p><p></p><p>
