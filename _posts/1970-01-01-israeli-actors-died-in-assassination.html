							Juliano Mer-Khamis was born to a Jewish mother and an Arab Christian father in Nazareth, Israel. He grew up in a diverse environment which inspired his passion for promoting co-existence and understanding between different cultures. Mer-Khamis studied theater in Tel Aviv and changed his name to Juliano Mer for his acting career. He starred in several Israeli films and television shows before moving to London and then the United States to pursue further study and work in theater.</p><p>In 1982, Mer-Khamis returned to Israel and established the Freedom Theater in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. The theater aimed to empower the local community through artistic expression, especially among young people. Mer-Khamis directed many plays and documentaries, which focused on issues such as oppression, injustice, and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</p><p>Mer-Khamis faced many challenges during his career, including death threats and assassination attempts by extremist groups who opposed his work for peace and co-existence. Tragically, he was shot dead in 2011 by a masked gunman outside the Freedom Theater, leaving behind his wife and son. However, his legacy lives through the Freedom Theater and the many lives he touched through his art and activism.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=23328622" title="Wikipedia article about Juliano Mer-Khamis">Juliano Mer-Khamis on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/canadian-actors-died-in-esophageal-cancer.html' title='Canadian actors died in Esophageal cancer'><strong>Canadian actors died in Esophageal cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Canadian actors who died in Esophageal cancer</a></li><li><a href='/indian-musicians-died-at-age-54.html' title='Indian musicians died at age 54'><strong>Indian musicians died at age 54</strong> List of the top 10 Indian music stars who died when they were 54</a></li><li><a href='/estonian-actresses-died-in-2014.html' title='Estonian actresses died in 2014'><strong>Estonian actresses died in 2014</strong> List of the top 1 Estonian actresses who died in 2014</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/hongkongese-actors-born-in-1947.html' title='Hongkongese actors born in 1947'><strong>Hongkongese actors born in 1947</strong> List of the top 5 Hongkongese actors who were born in 1947</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-actors-died-in-aneurysm.html' title='Japanese actors died in Aneurysm'><strong>Japanese actors died in Aneurysm</strong> List of the top 2 Japanese actors who died in Aneurysm</a></li><li><a href='/finnish-actors-died-at-age-73.html' title='Finnish actors died at age 73'><strong>Finnish actors died at age 73</strong> List of the top 4 Finnish actors who died when they were 73</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
