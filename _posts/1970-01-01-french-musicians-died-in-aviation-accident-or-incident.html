						Saint-Exupéry is most famous for his novella "The Little Prince," which has been translated into over 300 languages and has sold over 200 million copies worldwide. He initially wrote it in New York City, where he moved in 1940 to escape the German occupation of France during World War II. Prior to his relocation, he worked as a mail pilot in South America, an experience that inspired several of his novels such as "Night Flight" and "Wind, Sand and Stars." Saint-Exupéry disappeared on July 31, 1944 during a reconnaissance mission over the Mediterranean Sea and was declared missing, but his remains were later found in 1998. In addition to his writing and aviation careers, Saint-Exupéry was also a talented artist who illustrated some of his books himself.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=63174" title="Wikipedia article about Antoine de Saint-Exupéry">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Carlos Gardel</h2><p><strong>Carlos Gardel</strong>
