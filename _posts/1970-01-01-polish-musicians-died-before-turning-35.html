personality.


					</p><p>Correction: Bronisław Malinowski (April 7, 1884 Poland - May 16, 1942 New Haven, Connecticut, United States) was a British social anthropologist of Polish origin.

He has been credited with revolutionizing the study of anthropology and shaping modern social science.</p><p>Malinowski was born in Krakow, Poland to a family of intellectuals.

He went on to study at the London School of Economics under the influential anthropologist, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown.</p><p>Malinowski is particularly known for his method of participant observation, in which researchers immerse themselves in the culture they are studying in order to gain a deep understanding of their subjects. This approach was a departure from previous methods in anthropology in which researchers studied their subjects from a distance.</p><p>Throughout his career, Malinowski conducted extensive fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands, off the coast of New Guinea. He spent several years living among the islanders and learning their language and customs. His studies culminated in the publication of his most famous work, Argonauts of the Western Pacific.

He continued to conduct fieldwork and publish extensively throughout his life, including his posthumously published diary, A Diary in the Strict Sense of the Term.</p><p>Malinowski's contributions to anthropology have had a lasting impact on the field, influencing generations of researchers and shaping our understanding of the complexities of culture and society.</p><p></p><p>
