									</h1><p>Here are 10 famous musicians from France died at 55:</p><h2>Antoine Henri Becquerel</h2><p><strong>Antoine Henri Becquerel</strong>
(December 15, 1852		Paris-August 25, 1908			Le Croisic)

	
		a.k.a. Antoine-Henri Becquerel

	
was
a French
physicist.


					</p><p>He was born into a family of notable scientists and scholars including his grandfather, Antoine César Becquerel, and his father, Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel. Antoine Henri Becquerel's work focused on the phenomenon known as radioactivity, the spontaneous emission of particles or radiation from the atomic nucleus of certain elements. </p><p>In 1896, Becquerel discovered radioactivity accidentally while experimenting with phosphorescent materials. He found that uranium salts emitted rays that could penetrate thick paper and cause a photographic plate to become fogged. This discovery paved the way for further research into radioactivity and the development of important applications, such as nuclear medicine and atomic energy. </p><p>In 1903, Becquerel was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics along with Marie and Pierre Curie. He died in 1908 at the age of 55 in his hometown of Le Croisic, France, from a stroke. Today, he is remembered as a pioneer in the field of atomic physics and for his contributions to the study of radioactivity.</p><p>Becquerel's early scientific work focused on optics and electricity, and he helped to develop the polarimeter, an instrument used to measure the rotation of polarized light. He later expanded his research to include the properties of phosphorescent materials and their interaction with light. Becquerel was a member of the French Academy of Sciences and served as professor of physics at the Museum of Natural History in Paris. In addition to his work on radioactivity, he also studied the properties of X-rays and their medical applications. Today, the becquerel (Bq), a unit measuring radioactive decay, is named in his honor.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Theodore Rousseau

	
was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>He was a prominent figure in the Barbizon School of landscape painting, which paved the way for the Impressionist movement. Rousseau's early artistic style was influenced by his love for the outdoors, and he often painted scenes of nature from direct observation. </p><p>In 1830, Rousseau entered the Atelier Suisse in Paris and began exhibiting his paintings at the annual Salon. He gained recognition for his landscapes featuring the Forest of Fontainebleau, and was a regular participant in the Salon for many years. </p><p>Rousseau was also an avid collector of Japanese art, which influenced his later works. Despite his success, Rousseau was a reclusive figure and was known for his harsh criticism of other artists. </p><p>In the latter part of his career, Rousseau suffered from mental illness and stopped painting altogether.

Rousseau's deep appreciation for the natural world is evident in his works, which were characterized by a realistic and emotional portrayal of the landscape.</p><p>Although Rousseau's early work was influenced by the Romantic movement, he later moved away from its emphasis on emotion and instead focused on the realistic portrayal of nature. His later works, often referred to as his "mature period," were known for their tonal subtlety and the use of muted colors.</p><p>Rousseau was well respected in his lifetime, and his influence can be seen in the works of many later artists, including those of the Impressionist movement. Despite his initial criticisms of the movement, many of his techniques, such as his use of bright colors and his emphasis on the play of light, had a significant impact on Impressionist artists like Claude Monet.</p><p>Today, Rousseau is remembered as one of the most important landscape painters of the 19th century, and his works continue to be admired by art enthusiasts around the world.</p><p></p><p>
