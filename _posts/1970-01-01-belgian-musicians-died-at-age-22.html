(January 26, 1922		Poland-September 15, 1944)


was
a Belgian
personality.


					</p><p>Mala Zimetbaum was a Belgian Polish Jew who was imprisoned in Auschwitz during the Holocaust. She became known for her fearlessness and defiance against Nazi tyranny. Despite the harsh conditions of the camp, she organized resistance movements and helped fellow prisoners to survive. She also became fluent in several languages and became a translator for the camp administration. In an attempt to escape with her partner, she disguised herself as a non-Jewish inmate and managed to briefly evade capture. Unfortunately, they were eventually caught and Mala was subjected to brutal torture by the Nazi guards. She ultimately died by her own hand, jumping to her death from the third floor of a building in the camp. Today, Mala is remembered as a symbol of courage and resistance against oppression.</p><p>Mala Zimetbaum was born in Poland in 1922, but she grew up in Belgium after her family emigrated when she was still a child. She was a talented and gifted linguist and had an interest in art and music. After Germany invaded Belgium, Mala was arrested and deported to Auschwitz in 1942, where she was assigned prisoner number 19880. Despite the inhumane and brutal conditions of the camp, she remained optimistic and determined to help those around her. Mala was known for performing music and plays for the prisoners, and for using her language skills to communicate with inmates from other countries.</p><p>Mala's escape attempt was not her first act of defiance against the Nazi regime. She was also involved in the resistance movement within the concentration camp and worked to sabotage Nazi efforts. However, her escape attempt was the most daring of her acts of bravery. She and her partner Edek Galinski managed to hide out in the woods for several days before being caught and brought back to the camp.</p><p>Mala's torture at the hands of the Nazi guards after her attempted escape was especially brutal. She was subjected to numerous rounds of torture and public humiliation, but she never gave up the names of her fellow resistance activists. Her death, while tragic, was a final act of defiance and control over her own fate.</p><p>Today, Mala Zimetbaum is remembered as an icon of resistance and bravery, and her story serves as a reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust and the ultimate triumph of the human spirit.</p><p></p><p>
