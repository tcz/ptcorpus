(May 6, 1893		Tui-July 13, 1936			Madrid)

	
		also known as Jose Calvo Sotelo

	
was
a Spanish
politician.


					</p><p>Jose Calvo Sotelo was a prominent Spanish politician and leader of the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) party during the early 20th century. Born in Tui, Galicia, in 1893, he went on to attend the University of Madrid, where he earned a degree in Law. Calvo Sotelo became known for his conservative views and his fervent opposition to left-wing political movements, including socialism and communism. During the tumultuous political climate of the 1930s in Spain, Calvo Sotelo was a vocal critic of the left-leaning government, and his assassination on July 13, 1936, by members of the Spanish police force is widely considered to be one of the pivotal events leading up to the Spanish Civil War. His tragic death and the subsequent escalation of violence in Spain ultimately led to the rise of the authoritarian regime of General Francisco Franco.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Calvo Sotelo was also a writer and journalist, contributing to several conservative newspapers and magazines. He was particularly interested in military history and wrote several books on the topic. Calvo Sotelo was also a member of the Spanish Academy of Jurisprudence and Legislation and served as a professor of Law at the University of Salamanca. Despite his controversial political views, Calvo Sotelo was known for his eloquence and his ability to communicate complex ideas to a wide audience. His death at the hands of the Spanish police was widely condemned both within Spain and internationally, and became a rallying cry for right-wing factions in the country. Today, Calvo Sotelo is remembered as a key figure in the lead-up to the Spanish Civil War and as a symbol of the political violence and instability that characterized this period of Spanish history.</p><p></p><p>

(November 12, 1651		Tepetlixpa-April 17, 1695			Mexico City)

	
		also known as Juana Inés de la Cruz, Juana Inés de Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana, Juana Inés de la Cruz Sister or Sor Juana

	
was
a Spanish
writer, mathematician, poet and nun.


					</p><p>Considered one of the most important literary figures in the Spanish language, Juana Inés de la Cruz was a self-taught polymath who fiercely advocated for women's rights to education and knowledge. Despite her social status and gender, she became the court poet for Viceregal Mexico in the 17th century and her works of literature, religious philosophy, and feminist thought were published throughout Europe. However, her activism and intellectual autonomy put her at odds with the Church, prompting her to abandon writing and retreat to the Convent of Santa Paula in Mexico City, where she spent the remainder of her life. Her legacy as a trailblazer for gender equality and intellectual freedom continues to inspire scholars, feminists, and poets to this day.</p><p>Born to a Criollo family in colonial Mexico, Juana Inés de la Cruz exhibited a thirst for knowledge from an early age. At the age of three, she taught herself to read and by adolescence, she was already fluent in Latin. She begged her mother to allow her to dress as a boy so that she could attend the university, but her request was denied. Instead, she convinced a group of local scholars to tutor her in a variety of subjects ranging from philosophy to mathematics. </p><p>Juana Inés de la Cruz moved to Mexico City in 1664, where she became a lady-in-waiting to the vicereine. In the viceregal court, she quickly became known for her wit and intelligence, and she began writing poetry and plays. Her literary accomplishments earned her the patronage of the vicereine, and she soon became the most celebrated writer in colonial Mexico. Her works addressed topics such as love, spirituality, and the struggles of women in a patriarchal society.</p><p>Despite her success, Juana Inés de la Cruz faced criticism from the Church for her secular writing and her resistance to take orders. In 1690, she published a manifesto defending women's education, titled "Reply to Sor Philotea." The letter was addressed to the Bishop of Puebla, who had criticized her for her lack of humility and obedience. In her response, Juana Inés de la Cruz argued that women had the right to pursue knowledge and that the Church's criticism was unjustified. The letter infuriated the Church hierarchy, and Juana Inés de la Cruz was forced to give up her books and writing tools. She died a few years later, at the age of 43, following an outbreak of plague in her convent.</p><p>Today, Juana Inés de la Cruz is celebrated as a feminist icon and a literary genius. Her works continue to be studied and admired for their complexity and insight into the human experience, and she is remembered as a woman ahead of her time who refused to be silenced by the societal norms of her era.</p><p></p><p>

(May 6, 1809		Valle de la Serena-May 3, 1853			Paris)

	
		also known as Juan Donoso Cortes

	
was
a Spanish
writer, politician, philosopher and diplomat.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the most significant conservative thinkers of the 19th century and his political and philosophical ideas influenced many of his contemporaries and later generations. Donoso Cortés was a staunch defender of the Catholic Church and was critical of liberal democracy, advocating instead for a strong, authoritarian government.</p><p>Early in his career, Donoso Cortés served in the Spanish government as a lawyer and diplomat. He was later appointed ambassador to Germany and Austria, where he became acquainted with many influential figures in the conservative movement. In 1849, he published his most famous work, "Essay on Catholicism, Liberalism and Socialism", which argued that these three ideologies were irreconcilable and that liberalism and socialism threatened the existence of Western civilization.</p><p>Donoso Cortés' ideas were highly controversial and aroused both admiration and opposition. He was admired by thinkers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Miguel de Unamuno, but also criticized by liberals and socialists. Despite his influence in his time, his work fell into obscurity after his death, only to be rediscovered and reappraised in the 20th century.</p><p>Donoso Cortés was born into a noble family and was educated at a seminary and the University of Salamanca, where he studied law. He was known for his intelligence from a young age and had a remarkable talent for languages, being fluent in Spanish, French, English, and German. Apart from his diplomatic career, he was also a prolific writer and contributed to various newspapers and literary journals.</p><p>In addition to his political and philosophical works, Donoso Cortés also wrote poetry and drama, with some of his works being staged in Madrid during his time. He was married twice, and his second wife was the daughter of a German diplomat whom he met during his time as an ambassador to Germany.</p><p>Donoso Cortés' legacy continues to inspire conservative thinkers and politicians in Spain and beyond. His ideas on the role of religion and the state, the dangers of liberalism and socialism, and the need for a strong government continue to resonate in modern debates. His work remains a significant intellectual contribution to the development of conservative thought in Europe.</p><p></p><p>
