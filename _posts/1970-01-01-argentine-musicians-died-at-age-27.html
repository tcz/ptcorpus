(August 29, 1985-August 27, 2013)

	
		also known as Héctor Arnaldo Sanabria or Hector Sanabria

	
was
an Argentine
football player.


					</p><p>Sanabria was born on August 29th, 1985 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He began his football career in the youth academy of Club Atlético Boca Juniors, one of the most prestigious clubs in Argentina. Sanabria made his professional debut for Boca Juniors in 2005 and played for the team until 2008, during which he won two major domestic and international titles. </p><p>In 2008, Sanabria transferred to Club Atlético Tigre, where he played until 2011. He later played for other teams in Argentina such as Club Atlético Huracán and Club Atlético San Telmo. Sanabria was known for his strong physical presence and his ability to score goals from midfield.</p><p>Sadly, Sanabria passed away on August 27th, 2013 at the age of 27 due to a heart attack. His death was a shock for the Argentine football community, and many of his teammates and fans paid tribute to him. Despite his short career, Sanabria's impact on Argentine football was significant, and he will always be remembered as a talented player who left us too soon.</p><p>Sanabria's death came as a surprise to many, as he was a young and seemingly healthy athlete. After his passing, it was discovered that he had a pre-existing heart condition that may have contributed to his heart attack. Sanabria's death prompted discussions about the importance of medical evaluations for athletes and raised awareness about heart conditions in young people. In honor of Sanabria, his former teams and supporters have held memorials and moments of silence during matches. Sanabria's family also set up a foundation in his name to promote the importance of heart health and support young athletes in need.</p><p>In addition to his football career, Sanabria was also known for his dedication to his family and his community. He was a devoted husband and father, and he often participated in local charity events and fundraisers. Sanabria's passion for helping others and his commitment to his loved ones were qualities that endeared him to many people, both on and off the field.</p><p>Sanabria's legacy in Argentine football continues to this day. His talent and work ethic inspired many young players, and his name is still remembered with great respect by fans of Boca Juniors, Tigre, and other teams he played for. Sanabria's untimely death was a tragedy, but his life and career will always be remembered as a testament to the power of dedication, hard work, and love.</p><p>After Sanabria's death, his former club Boca Juniors paid tribute to him by organizing a friendly match against Club Atlético Tigre, where Sanabria played from 2008 to 2011. The match was called "Homenaje a Héctor Sanabria" (Homage to Héctor Sanabria) and took place on September 9th, 2013, at the La Bombonera stadium in Buenos Aires. Before the game, a moment of silence was held in honor of Sanabria, and his family members and former teammates were invited to attend. The match ended with a 0-0 tie but was more about paying respect to Sanabria and his contributions to Argentine football.</p><p>Sanabria's unexpected death also led to new regulations in Argentine football regarding medical evaluations for players. The Argentine Football Association (AFA) implemented mandatory heart screenings for all players before the start of each season. The screenings include an electrocardiogram, an echo-cardiogram, and other tests to detect any underlying heart conditions that may put players at risk.</p><p>Sanabria's foundation, called "Héctor Sanabria Por los Niños" (Héctor Sanabria for the Children), continues to make a difference in the lives of young athletes and their families. The foundation provides support for children who are passionate about sports but do not have the financial means to pursue their dreams. It also promotes heart health and raises awareness about the importance of regular check-ups.</p><p>In conclusion, Héctor Sanabria was not only a talented football player but also a loving family man and community-oriented person. He may have had a short career, but his contribution to Argentine football goes beyond his achievements on the field. Sanabria's death was a tragedy, but it led to positive changes in the sport and inspired many to pursue their dreams while keeping their health in check.</p><p></p><p>

Cuzzani's works explored themes of power, corruption, and justice, often using satire and humor to criticize the political and social realities of his time. He was awarded the National Prize for Theater in 1984.</p><p>Cuzzani was born in Buenos Aires in 1922 and studied literature and theater at the Instituto Libre de Segunda Enseñanza.
