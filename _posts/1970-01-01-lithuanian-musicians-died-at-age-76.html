(November 20, 1890		Rusnė-February 24, 1967)

	
		also known as Otto Tolischus

	
was
a Lithuanian
journalist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his coverage of World War II and his work as a correspondent for The New York Times. Tolischus began his career in journalism in Germany in the 1920s and covered events such as the rise of the Nazi Party. He later moved to the United States and joined The New York Times in 1934. </p><p>During World War II, Tolischus reported from various fronts including the Eastern Front and North Africa. He was also present at the Yalta Conference in 1945 where he covered the negotiations between the leaders of the Allied powers. </p><p>After the war, Tolischus continued to work for The New York Times and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 for his coverage of the Marshall Plan. He retired in 1956 but continued to write and publish articles until his death in 1967.</p><p>Tolischus was born in Rusnė, a small town in Lithuania, which was then part of the Russian Empire. He studied at the University of Berlin and later worked as a correspondent for various German newspapers before moving to the United States in 1933. He joined The New York Times a year later, where his reporting on World War II earned him widespread recognition for his insightful analysis and vivid descriptions of the conflict. </p><p>Tolischus brought a unique perspective to his reporting, having grown up in a region that was caught between competing empires and later having witnessed the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. His reporting on the Soviet Union and the Eastern Front was particularly insightful, and he was fluent in both German and Russian, which allowed him to communicate effectively with sources and officials on all sides of the conflict. </p><p>In addition to his reporting on World War II, Tolischus was also known for his coverage of the post-war rebuilding efforts in Europe and the Cold War. He was a strong advocate for European integration and supported the creation of the European Economic Community, which laid the groundwork for the modern European Union. </p><p>Tolischus was a prolific writer and author of several books, including "There's Germany Between Us" (1941), which chronicled the relationship between the United States and Nazi Germany in the run-up to the war. He was known for his incisive commentary on world affairs and his commitment to journalism as a public service.</p><p>Tolischus was a staunch believer in the importance of objective reporting and was known for maintaining his journalistic integrity, even in the face of intense pressure and censorship. He once famously defied orders from his editors to tone down his reporting on the Nazi Party and continued to write critically about the regime, even as other journalists were being silenced or intimidated. Tolischus' reporting played a significant role in shaping public opinion about the war and the need for the United States to intervene. </p><p>In addition to his Pulitzer Prize, Tolischus received numerous other accolades for his work, including the George Polk Memorial Award and the Overseas Press Club's Edward Weintal Award. He was also honored by the governments of France, Italy, and West Germany for his contributions to journalism and his advocacy for European unity. Tolischus passed away in 1967 at the age of 76, but his legacy as a fearless and dedicated journalist continues to inspire generations of reporters and writers.</p><p></p><p>
