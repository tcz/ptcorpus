(February 8, 1911		Worcester-October 6, 1979			Boston)


was
an American
writer and poet.


					</p><p>She was best known for her vivid and descriptive poetry, which often explored themes of loss, love, and the beauty of the natural world. Bishop was also a prolific letter writer and wrote over 2,500 letters throughout her life, many of which have been compiled into published collections. Her most famous works include "One Art," "The Fish," and "In the Waiting Room." Bishop was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1956 and served as the poet laureate of the United States from 1949 to 1950. She also taught at a number of universities throughout her career, including Harvard, New York University, and the University of Washington. Despite struggling with alcoholism and depression throughout her life, Bishop is still widely regarded as one of the most important American poets of the 20th century.</p><p>Bishop was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, but lost both of her parents at a young age and was sent to live with her grandparents in Nova Scotia, Canada. She spent much of her childhood moving between Nova Scotia and the United States and had a difficult upbringing due to strained relationships with her family members. Bishop attended Vassar College, where she studied English and met Marianne Moore, who became a mentor to her.</p><p>During her lifetime, Bishop traveled extensively and spent many years living abroad in countries such as Brazil, France, and Canada. These experiences heavily influenced her writing, and she often wrote about her observations of foreign cultures and landscapes.</p><p>Bishop was openly gay, and her relationships with women were an important subject in her poetry. However, she struggled with being open about her sexuality during a time when homosexuality was extremely stigmatized in society.</p><p>After her death in 1979, Bishop's work continued to be widely praised and studied, and she remains an important figure in American literature. In addition to her poetry and letters, she also wrote a number of essays and translated the work of several Brazilian poets into English.</p><p>Bishop was known for her meticulous and deliberate approach to writing, often spending years on a single poem. She was highly regarded for her attention to detail and precision of language, and her poetry is characterized by its clarity and vivid imagery.</p><p>Throughout her life, Bishop struggled with alcoholism and depression, which often affected her writing. She also struggled with writer's block, which led to periods of inactivity in her career. Despite these challenges, Bishop continued to produce work that was widely praised for its depth and beauty.</p><p>In addition to her accolades and accomplishments, Bishop's personal life has also garnered significant attention over the years. She had a number of close relationships with women throughout her life, including the Brazilian architect Lota de Macedo Soares, with whom she lived for over a decade. Their relationship was tumultuous, and Bishop wrote extensively about their time together in her letters and poetry.</p><p>Today, Bishop is widely recognized as one of the most important poets of her generation. Her work continues to be studied and celebrated for its profound insight into the human experience and its exquisite use of language and imagery.</p><p>Despite her accomplishments, Bishop struggled with feelings of insecurity and self-doubt, often questioning the value of her own work. She was known to be highly self-critical and sometimes burned her own manuscripts out of frustration. Bishop also struggled with health problems throughout her life and was diagnosed with asthma at a young age, which often caused her difficulty breathing and limited her physical activity.</p><p>Bishop's writing style was characterized by its precision and attention to detail, with many of her poems featuring meticulous descriptions of nature and everyday life. She was a perfectionist when it came to her work, often spending weeks or even months revising a single poem until she was satisfied with it.</p><p>In addition to her writing, Bishop was also a talented visual artist and often incorporated her drawings and sketches into her letters and poems. Her visual art was heavily influenced by her travels and included a range of styles, from landscapes and portraits to abstract drawings and collages.</p><p>Despite her struggles with mental and physical health, Bishop remained a dedicated and prolific writer until the end of her life. She died in 1979 from a cerebral aneurysm at the age of 68, but her legacy as one of the greatest American poets of the 20th century lives on through her poetry, letters, and essays.</p><p></p><p>
