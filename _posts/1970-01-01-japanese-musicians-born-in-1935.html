		otherwise known as Takahata, Isao, Paku-san, Tetsu Takemoto or Takahata Isao

	
is
a Japanese
film director, animation director, film producer, screenwriter and translator.


						</p><p>He was one of the co-founders of the famed Japanese animation company, Studio Ghibli, alongside his longtime collaborator and friend, Hayao Miyazaki. Takahata is known for his contributions to classic animated films such as "Grave of the Fireflies," "Only Yesterday," and "The Tale of the Princess Kaguya." </p><p>In his early career, Takahata worked for Toei Animation, where he directed numerous popular animated TV shows and feature films. He later left Toei Animation and co-founded his own animation studio, which eventually evolved into Studio Ghibli. </p><p>Throughout his career, Takahata has received numerous awards and accolades for his contributions to the world of animation, including the prestigious Order of the Rising Sun from the Japanese government in 2015. While he passed away in 2018, his legacy and impact on the animation industry continue to be felt by fans and animators alike all around the world.</p><p>Takahata was born in Ujiyamada city, which is now called Ise, in Mie Prefecture, Japan. He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1959 with a degree in French literature. After completing his degree, he began working for Toei Animation, one of Japan's leading animation studios at the time. It was at Toei that he first met Miyazaki, with whom he would go on to form a lifelong partnership.</p><p>Takahata's work often explored serious themes, such as war, death, and societal pressures. His film "Grave of the Fireflies," which depicts the struggles of two siblings during the Kobe bombing of World War II, is considered a masterpiece of animation and a powerful anti-war statement. Takahata also directed "Only Yesterday," a film about a woman reflecting on her childhood, and "The Tale of the Princess Kaguya," a retelling of a traditional Japanese folk tale.</p><p>Despite his success and critical acclaim, Takahata remained somewhat of a reclusive figure, preferring to let his work speak for itself. However, those who worked with him remember him as a passionate and dedicated filmmaker who pushed the boundaries of what animation could achieve. His influence on the animation industry is still felt today, as many contemporary animators cite him as a major inspiration.</p><p></p><p>
