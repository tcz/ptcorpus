wrestler.


					</p><p>Born with the name Jean Emile, The French Angel began his wrestling career in the 1930s, gaining immense popularity due to his imposing physique and intimidating ring presence.

(May 29, 1897		Pokój, Opole Voivodeship-December 27, 1947			Braunschweig)


was
a German
engineer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on the development of liquid-fueled rockets. Winkler was one of the pioneers of rocketry in Germany and worked closely with other notable figures in the field such as Wernher von Braun. In 1932, he successfully launched the first liquid-fueled rocket, which reached an altitude of over 1,000 feet.</p><p>During World War II, Winkler worked on the development of rocket technology for the German army. After the war, he was briefly held as a prisoner of war by the British before being released. He returned to Germany and continued his work on rocketry, but died in a laboratory accident in 1947.</p><p>Winkler's contributions to rocket science were significant and helped lay the groundwork for the development of modern rockets and space exploration.</p><p>In addition to his groundbreaking work in rocketry, Johannes Winkler was also an accomplished engineer and inventor. He studied at the Technical University of Charlottenburg, where he earned a degree in mechanical engineering in 1922. After completing his studies, he worked for several companies in Germany and Switzerland, including Junkers and Siemens-Schuckert, where he gained experience in aeronautics and electrical engineering.</p><p>Winkler's interest in rocketry was sparked by a lecture he attended in 1925 on the work of American rocket scientist Robert Goddard. He became convinced that liquid-fueled rockets were the key to unlocking the potential of spaceflight and began experimenting with different designs in his spare time. He eventually developed a system that used a combination of liquid oxygen and gasoline as fuel, which was more efficient and powerful than previous designs.</p><p>Winkler's success in launching the first liquid-fueled rocket in 1932 was a major milestone in the history of space exploration. He went on to develop more advanced rockets, including the HW-2, which was used by the German army during World War II. Although his work was ultimately co-opted by the Nazi regime and used to devastating effect, Winkler himself was not a member of the Nazi Party and was more interested in the scientific and technical aspects of rocketry than in military applications.</p><p>Despite his tragic death at the age of 50, Johannes Winkler's legacy continues to live on in the field of rocket science. His pioneering work laid the foundation for the development of the modern space program, and his vision of using rockets to explore the cosmos has inspired generations of scientists and engineers.</p><p></p><p>
