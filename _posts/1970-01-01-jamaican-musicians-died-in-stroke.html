									</h1><p>Here are 3 famous musicians from Jamaica died in Stroke:</p><h2>Marcus Garvey</h2><p><strong>Marcus Garvey</strong>
(August 17, 1887		Saint Ann&#039;s Bay, Jamaica-June 10, 1940			London)


was
a Jamaican
journalist, writer and publisher.


					</p><p>He was a prominent activist and leader in the black nationalist and Pan-Africanism movements. Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League in 1914, which aimed to unite people of African descent and promote black self-reliance. He believed in the importance of economic independence for black people and encouraged entrepreneurship and the establishment of black-owned businesses. Garvey's ideas and teachings greatly influenced later civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Despite facing criticism and opposition from many, Garvey continued to inspire and empower people of African descent until his death in 1940.</p><p>Garvey was known for his powerful speeches, which emphasized the need for black people to unite and work together towards their own liberation. He believed in the concept of "Africa for Africans" and led the "Back to Africa" movement, which encouraged black people to return to Africa and establish a homeland. He founded the Black Star Line, a shipping company that aimed to connect black people throughout the world and transport goods to Africa, as well as The Negro World newspaper which spread his ideas and messages. Garvey's activism and teachings had a significant impact on the civil rights movement, particularly in the United States where his ideas were embraced by many in the black community. Despite being jailed and eventually deported by the US government, Garvey's legacy and vision continued to inspire generations of activists to come.</p><p>While Garvey was highly regarded for his civil rights work and activism, he also faced criticism from some in the black community, as well as from government officials who viewed him as a threat. In 1922, he was arrested and charged with mail fraud related to the selling of stock in the Black Star Line. He was eventually sentenced to five years imprisonment, but was released on probation after serving two years. Despite this setback, Garvey continued to advocate for black liberation and entrepreneurship upon his release.</p><p>Garvey's influence extended beyond North America, to the Caribbean and Africa as well. He spent time in London and worked to connect with the African diaspora there, as well as establishing a branch of the Universal Negro Improvement Association in Cape Town, South Africa.</p><p>Garvey's legacy continues to be celebrated and studied by scholars and activists. He is considered a pioneer of the black nationalist movement and a key figure in the history of African-American and African liberation movements.</p><p>In addition to his work with the Universal Negro Improvement Association and the Back to Africa movement, Garvey also played a significant role in advocating for political independence for African nations. He founded the African Communities League, which aimed to promote self-government and independence for African countries. Garvey also played a role in the founding of the African Legion, which was a paramilitary organization that aimed to support and defend the interests of people of African descent. </p><p>Garvey's ideas regarding black self-reliance and economic independence continued to inspire others long after his death. The Black Power movement of the 1960s and 70s drew heavily from Garvey's teachings, and many leaders of that movement considered themselves to be following in his footsteps. In addition, Garvey's emphasis on the importance of entrepreneurship and self-sufficiency continues to be relevant to this day in the context of discussions around economic justice and empowerment in black communities. </p><p>Garvey also left a notable cultural legacy. His phrase "One God, One Aim, One Destiny" became a popular slogan among black nationalists, and he is often credited with popularizing the colors of black, red, and green as symbols of pan-Africanism. His ideas and teachings have been referenced and honored in numerous works of literature, music, and film.</p><p>Garvey's impact on the civil rights movement can still be seen today. He inspired generations of African Americans to take pride in their identity and to fight against oppression. His teachings on self-reliance and economic independence continue to inspire black entrepreneurs and business leaders. Garvey's call for unity among people of African descent remains relevant, and his vision of a homeland in Africa for black people has influenced the development of modern-day movements such as Afrofuturism. Even after his death, Garvey's legacy continues to inspire people around the world to fight for equality, justice, and liberation.</p><p></p><p>
