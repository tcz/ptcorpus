However, when Joseph died in 1790, Leopold ascended to the throne.</p><p>As emperor, Leopold was known for his efforts to modernize the Holy Roman Empire and to improve the lives of its citizens.

(April 5, 1470		Romania-July 20, 1514)

	
		a.k.a. Gyorgy Dozsa

	
was
a Hungarian
personality.


					</p><p>György Dózsa was a nobleman and soldier who led a peasant revolt against the ruling class in Hungary in the early 16th century. He is most famous for his leadership of the "Dózsa rebellion" in 1514, which started as a protest against the abusive treatment of peasants by the nobility but quickly turned into a full-fledged uprising. Dózsa's peasant army fought fiercely for several weeks, but their lack of training and weaponry eventually led to their defeat. Dózsa was captured and subjected to a gruesome execution: he was seated on a red-hot iron throne and forced to wear a crown of red-hot iron before being torn apart by horses. Despite his brutal end, Dózsa's legacy lived on as a symbol of Hungarian resistance to oppression.</p><p>György Dózsa was born in Transylvania to a noble family. He had a successful military career and was known for his bravery and leadership skills. During his service in the Ottoman-Habsburg Wars, he witnessed the harsh conditions of the peasants and the corruption of the nobility. These experiences made him sympathetic to the plight of the lower classes and sparked his desire to fight for their rights.</p><p>The Dózsa rebellion, which he led, was one of the largest and deadliest uprisings in Hungary. The peasant army, which numbered in the tens of thousands, captured several towns and castles before being defeated by the better-equipped and trained forces of the nobility. Despite the failure of his rebellion, Dózsa's actions inspired others to continue his fight for social justice.</p><p>In addition to being a military leader, Dózsa was also a poet and philosopher. He wrote several works that expressed his views on the nature of power, justice, and the human condition. Although his writings were not widely known during his lifetime, they gained popularity after his death and were later used to inspire the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.</p><p>Today, György Dózsa is regarded as a national hero in Hungary and is celebrated for his fight against oppression and tyranny. Many streets, parks, and schools in Hungary are named in his honor, and his legacy continues to inspire those who fight for social justice and equality.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of execution.

(December 20, 1852		Keszthely-January 13, 1897			Vienna)


was
a Hungarian
pilot.


					</p><p>Schwarz was born in Keszthely, Hungary, on December 20, 1852. He studied engineering and became a draftsman in a shipyard in Budapest. After gaining experience in the shipbuilding industry, he began to design and build airships, becoming a pioneer in aviation.</p><p>In 1896, Schwarz completed a prototype of his airship, which was made of aluminum and had a cigar-shaped body. The rigid structure allowed for greater stability than other balloons of the time.</p><p>Unfortunately, Schwarz died before he could see the success of his design. His airship was later modified and flown by several other pilots, including Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, who credited Schwarz with inspiring his own airship designs. Today, David Schwarz is remembered as one of the earliest pioneers of aviation.</p><p>Schwarz's airship design was revolutionary, as it was one of the first to feature an aluminum frame. This made the airship lighter and more durable than previous models made with wooden frames. Schwarz's design also included a motor for propulsion, making it one of the few airships of the time that could be controlled and steered. </p><p>Despite his pioneering work, Schwarz struggled to gain financial backing for his airship designs. He faced opposition from government officials who believed that air travel was a dangerous and impractical idea. Nevertheless, Schwarz persisted in his work and continued to refine his designs until his untimely death in 1897. </p><p>After his death, his widow attempted to continue his work, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Schwarz's legacy, however, lived on through the work of other aviation pioneers, including Ferdinand von Zeppelin. Today, he is remembered as one of the earliest and most important figures in the history of aviation.</p><p></p><p>
