(December 19, 1910		Havana-August 9, 1976			Havana)

	
		also known as Jose Lezama Lima

	
was
a Cuban
writer and novelist.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the most important figures of Cuban literature of the 20th century, and his novel Paradiso is considered a masterpiece of Latin American literature. Lezama Lima was part of a literary movement in Cuba known as "el grupo Orígenes," which aimed to revive Cuban culture and literature by incorporating elements of European modernism and surrealism. Lezama Lima also worked as a journalist and a professor of literature, and he was a key figure in a cultural scene that included artists such as Wifredo Lam and Cintio Vitier. His writing explores themes such as sexuality, spirituality, and the Cuban identity, and his style has been praised for its lyricism and complexity. Lezama Lima's influence on Cuban literature continues to be felt today, and he is widely regarded as one of the most challenging and rewarding writers of the Spanish language.</p><p>In addition to Paradiso, Lezama Lima also wrote a number of other influential works, including his poetry collection La Fijeza (The Fixity) and his essay collection La Expresión Americana (The American Expression). He was known for his extensive knowledge of literature, philosophy, and art, and his writing is often characterized by its intertextuality and allusions to works from a variety of fields. Despite his literary fame, Lezama Lima remained a relatively private person throughout his life, and he did not publish many of his works until later in life. After his death, his papers and manuscripts were donated to the Cuban National Library, where they have been studied and celebrated by scholars and writers alike. Today, Lezama Lima's legacy continues to inspire new generations of writers and thinkers, both in Cuba and beyond.</p><p>Lezama Lima was born into an upper-middle-class family in Havana, and he spent most of his formative years immersed in a rich cultural environment. His parents were both avid readers, and they encouraged his interests in literature and the arts from a young age. Lezama Lima attended the University of Havana, where he studied law and philosophy, but he was more interested in literature and soon abandoned his studies to pursue a career as a writer.</p><p>In the 1940s, Lezama Lima became involved in the cultural scene in Havana, where he met other writers and artists who shared his interest in avant-garde and experimental forms of expression. Together with a group of fellow writers, including Eliseo Diego, Fina García Marruz, and Virgilio Piñera, he founded the literary magazine Orígenes, which became an important platform for the development of a new Cuban literary aesthetic.</p><p>In the following years, Lezama Lima continued to publish his writing in a variety of formats, including poetry, essays, and literary criticism. However, it was his mammoth novel, Paradiso, published in 1966, which cemented his reputation as a major literary figure. The novel is a complex, sprawling work that combines elements of myth, history, and philosophy with a richly imagined, semi-autobiographical narrative.</p><p>Lezama Lima's writing was deeply informed by his own experiences of growing up in Havana, and he was particularly interested in exploring the intersections of race, class, and sexuality in Cuban society. His work is often regarded as a reflection of the complex cultural and political realities of Cuba in the mid-20th century, and his influence on subsequent generations of Cuban writers and artists cannot be overstated.</p><p>Lezama Lima's writing was heavily influenced by his Catholic upbringing, as well as his interest in Eastern philosophy and mysticism. He saw literature as a means of exploring the profound mysteries of existence, and his work often dealt with themes of spirituality, transcendence, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world. Lezama Lima's writing also reflected his own struggles with his sexuality, which he saw as an essential aspect of his identity. His frank treatment of queer themes in his writing was groundbreaking for its time, and he has since been recognized as a pioneering queer writer in Latin America.</p><p>Despite his literary acclaim, Lezama Lima faced significant obstacles during his lifetime, including censorship by the Cuban government and struggles with financial insecurity. He was also plagued by health problems throughout his life, including severe hypertension and diabetes. Lezama Lima died in 1976, at the age of 65, leaving behind a legacy of literary and intellectual brilliance that continues to inspire readers and writers around the world.</p><p>After his death, several posthumous works by Lezama Lima were published, including Oppiano Licario, a novel that he had been working on for over 20 years. The novel, which was unfinished at the time of his death, was edited and published by his literary executor, Ambrosio Fornet. Oppiano Licario is a highly experimental work that combines a range of literary genres and styles, and it has been hailed as a masterpiece of Cuban literature. Lezama Lima's influence on literature in Latin America and beyond has continued to grow in the years since his death, and he has been the subject of numerous critical studies and academic conferences. In 2010, on the centenary of his birth, several events were held in Havana and elsewhere to celebrate his life and work. Today, Lezama Lima is remembered as one of the greatest writers of the Spanish language, and his legacy continues to inspire readers and writers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
