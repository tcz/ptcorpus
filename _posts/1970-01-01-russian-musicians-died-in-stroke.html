						Eduard Khil was widely known for his viral hit song "Trololo," originally performed in 1976. The word "trololo" is actually nonsensical and was used as a placeholder for the lyrics in the song. However, the melody and Khil's unique vocalizations made it a hit and the song became known as "The Trololo Song" or "The Russian Rickroll." </p><p>Before becoming a singer, Khil studied at the Leningrad Conservatory and won several awards for his performances. He initially began his music career as a jazz singer and later transitioned into pop music. Khil also performed in a number of Soviet films and television shows throughout his career.</p><p>In 2010, Khil's "Trololo" video resurfaced online and went viral, making him an internet sensation at the age of 76. He later went on to perform the song on a number of talk shows and even released a new version of it in 2012.</p><p>Despite the success of "Trololo," Khil continued to release music and perform throughout his career. He was awarded the Order of Merit for the Fatherland in 2009 for his contribution to Russian music. Khil passed away in 2012 at the age of 77.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=26423558" title="Wikipedia article about Eduard Khil">Eduard Khil on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/venezuelan-musicians-died-at-age-32.html' title='Venezuelan musicians died at age 32'><strong>Venezuelan musicians died at age 32</strong> List of the top 1 Venezuelan music stars who died when they were 32</a></li><li><a href='/greek-actors-died-in-1964.html' title='Greek actors died in 1964'><strong>Greek actors died in 1964</strong> List of the top 2 Greek actors who died in 1964</a></li><li><a href='/dutch-actors-died-before-turning-40.html' title='Dutch actors died before turning 40'><strong>Dutch actors died before turning 40</strong> List of the top 2 Dutch actors who died before they turned 40</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/dutch-musicians-died-at-age-79.html' title='Dutch musicians died at age 79'><strong>Dutch musicians died at age 79</strong> List of the top 27 Dutch music stars who died when they were 79</a></li><li><a href='/egyptian-musicians-died-at-age-50.html' title='Egyptian musicians died at age 50'><strong>Egyptian musicians died at age 50</strong> List of the top 2 Egyptian music stars who died when they were 50</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-at-age-49.html' title='Famous actors died at age 49'><strong>Famous actors died at age 49</strong> List of the top 7 Famous actors who died when they were 49</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
