a Cameroonian
actor, dancer and choreographer.



						</p><p>He spent much of his childhood in Congo-Brazzaville, where he was exposed to traditional Congolese music and dance as well as modern dance styles. He later moved to the United States and became a prominent figure in the Bay Area dance scene, co-founding the Fua Dia Congo dance company and later founding his own company, the Malonga Casquelourd Center for the Arts. He also appeared in several films and television shows, including "The Color Purple" and "Walker, Texas Ranger." Casquelourd was a respected teacher and mentor, and his work helped to bridge the gap between African and African-American dance traditions. He passed away in 2003 at the age of 55.</p><p>Casquelourd's work was deeply rooted in his African heritage and he was known for incorporating traditional African dance and music into his performances. He was also a skilled drummer and played a significant role in keeping African drumming alive in the San Francisco Bay Area. In addition to his work as a performer and choreographer, he worked as a cultural ambassador, traveling throughout the United States and Africa to teach and promote African dance and culture. In recognition of his contributions, the city of Oakland renamed a street near his arts center "Malonga Casquelourd Way" in his honor. To this day, his legacy lives on through the Malonga Casquelourd Center for the Arts, which continues to provide a platform for African and African-American artists to showcase their work.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/bosnian-actors-died-at-age-29.html' title='Bosnian actors died at age 29'><strong>Bosnian actors died at age 29</strong> List of the top 1 Bosnian actors who died when they were 29</a></li><li><a href='/czech-actors-born-in-1923.html' title='Czech actors born in 1923'><strong>Czech actors born in 1923</strong> List of the top 10 Czech actors who were born in 1923</a></li><li><a href='/belgian-actors-died-in-1969.html' title='Belgian actors died in 1969'><strong>Belgian actors died in 1969</strong> List of the top 1 Belgian actors who died in 1969</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/mexican-musicians-died-at-age-68.html' title='Mexican musicians died at age 68'><strong>Mexican musicians died at age 68</strong> List of the top 17 Mexican music stars who died when they were 68</a></li><li><a href='/english-actors-died-in-2003.html' title='English actors died in 2003'><strong>English actors died in 2003</strong> List of the top 15 English actors who died in 2003</a></li><li><a href='/turkish-musicians-died-at-age-46.html' title='Turkish musicians died at age 46'><strong>Turkish musicians died at age 46</strong> List of the top 2 Turkish music stars who died when they were 46</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
