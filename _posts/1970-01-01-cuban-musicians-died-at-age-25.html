(March 14, 1937		Santa Clara-April 3, 1962			Manhattan)


was
a Cuban
professional boxer.


					</p><p>Benny Paret was a welterweight fighter who had a successful career in the ring. He won the world welterweight championship twice, and he was known for his aggressive fighting style. However, his career came to a tragic end on March 24, 1962, during a televised fight against Emile Griffith. Griffith landed a series of intense punches that caused Paret to collapse, hitting his head on the mat. He was hospitalized and died ten days later due to severe brain injuries. This incident brought widespread attention to the dangers of boxing and sparked debates over the sport's safety.</p><p>The aftermath of Paret's death led to significant changes in the regulation of boxing. The New York State Athletic Commission was criticized for not stopping the fight and for allowing Paret to go back into the ring after being knocked down numerous times. The incident also led to changes in the way boxing matches were televised, with a delay being introduced to allow officials to stop a fight if necessary. Emile Griffith was greatly affected by the incident and carried the weight of Paret's death for the rest of his life. In 1995, he was interviewed about the fight and broke down in tears, saying he never meant to kill anyone. Paret's death remains a tragic reminder of the danger and brutality that can be present in sports.</p><p>After Benny Paret's death, his wife and daughter found themselves in a financially precarious situation. To help support them, the boxing community raised money through charity events and fundraisers. The World Boxing Council later established an annual award in Paret's honor, called the "Benny Paret-Diogenes Ponce Award." The award is given to recognize acts of courage and sportsmanship in boxing.</p><p>Paret's death also inspired a song by folk singer Bob Dylan, titled "Who Killed Davey Moore?" The song questions the responsibility of those involved in boxing for the death of fighters like Paret. The lyrics include the line, "who killed Davey Moore/Why an' what's the reason for?" which later became a rallying cry for those advocating for safer conditions for boxers.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his death, Benny Paret remains one of the most successful and celebrated Cuban boxers of all time. He is remembered for his aggressive fighting style and his two world welterweight championship victories. His death, however, also serves as a poignant reminder of the dangers inherent in contact sports and the importance of regulating them appropriately.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by injuries sustained in boxing.
