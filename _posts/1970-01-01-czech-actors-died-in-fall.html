							Hrabal was a key figure in Czech literature, known for his experimental style and use of stream-of-consciousness narrative technique. He began his writing career in the 1950s, but it wasn't until the publication of his novel "Closely Watched Trains" in 1965 that he gained widespread recognition. The book was later adapted into an Academy Award-winning film in 1967. Hrabal continued to write prolifically throughout his life, often drawing on his own experiences as inspiration. He was also known for his love of cats and was often photographed with his feline companions. In addition to writing, Hrabal also worked as an actor in several Czech films, including "The Firemen's Ball" and "Closely Watched Trains". He died in 1997 after falling from a fifth-story window of a Prague hospital, but his legacy as a pioneering and influential Czech writer lives on to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=65130" title="Wikipedia article about Bohumil Hrabal">Bohumil Hrabal on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/thai-musicians-died-at-age-48.html' title='Thai musicians died at age 48'><strong>Thai musicians died at age 48</strong> List of the top 1 Thai music stars who died when they were 48</a></li><li><a href='/russian-actors-born-in-1977.html' title='Russian actors born in 1977'><strong>Russian actors born in 1977</strong> List of the top 5 Russian actors who were born in 1977</a></li><li><a href='/guinea-bissauan-musicians-died-at-age-64.html' title='Guinea-Bissauan musicians died at age 64'><strong>Guinea-Bissauan musicians died at age 64</strong> List of the top 1 Guinea-Bissauan music stars who died when they were 64</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/czechoslovakian-musicians-died-before-turning-20.html' title='Czechoslovakian musicians died before turning 20'><strong>Czechoslovakian musicians died before turning 20</strong> List of the top 2 Czechoslovakian music stars who died before 20</a></li><li><a href='/irish-musicians-died-in-melanoma.html' title='Irish musicians died in Melanoma'><strong>Irish musicians died in Melanoma</strong> List of the top 1 Irish music stars who died in Melanoma</a></li><li><a href='/czechoslovakian-actresses-died-in-1992.html' title='Czechoslovakian actresses died in 1992'><strong>Czechoslovakian actresses died in 1992</strong> List of the top 1 Czechoslovakian actresses who died in 1992</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
