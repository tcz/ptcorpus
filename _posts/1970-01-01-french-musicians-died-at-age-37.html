physician.


					</p><p>During his relatively short life, Duchesne made several important contributions to the field of medicine. He is best known for his discovery of the antibiotic properties of a particular strain of mold, which he called "penicillium glaucum". This discovery predated Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin by over 30 years, but unfortunately, Duchesne's work was largely overlooked at the time.</p><p>In addition to his groundbreaking research on antibiotics, Duchesne also made important contributions to the study of tuberculosis, particularly in the area of immunology. His work helped to establish the importance of the cellular immune response in fighting this disease.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Duchesne's career was cut short by his illness. He died at the age of 37, but his legacy lived on through his research and the work of those he inspired. Today, he is considered one of the great pioneers of modern medicine, and his contributions continue to influence medical research and practice around the world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by tuberculosis.
