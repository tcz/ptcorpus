					</p><p>Most famous for his novel, "Les Amours du chevalier de Faublas", which broke social conventions and was banned soon after its publication in 1787. He was also involved in the French Revolution, serving as a deputy in the National Convention and later the Council of the Five Hundred. Louvet de Couvrai was a member of the Girondin faction, which wanted to institute a constitutional monarchy and opposed the radical Montagnards. He was arrested during the Reign of Terror in 1793 and sentenced to death, but managed to escape and went into hiding. After the fall of Maximilien Robespierre, he returned to public life and continued to be involved in politics until his death.</p><p>As a member of the French Revolution, Louvet de Couvrai was an advocate for the rights of women and slaves. He wrote articles and speeches on these topics and was seen as a progressive thinker for his time. He also worked towards the abolition of the death penalty, a cause he supported passionately. After the Revolution, Louvet de Couvrai continued to write and published several more novels and plays. However, he struggled financially and died in poverty at the age of 37, leaving behind a legacy as a writer and political activist.</p><p>Despite his controversial works, Louvet de Couvrai's contribution to French literature and advocacy for social justice makes him a significant figure in the intellectual and political movements of his time. His literary works, including his play "La Caverne" and his political writings, such as his pamphlets on women's rights, continue to inspire and inform modern-day movements.

Despite his tragedies and hardships in life, Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvrai remains a significant figure in the French literary and political landscape to this day.</p><p>In addition to his political and literary pursuits, Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvrai was also a supporter of the arts. He was a passionate advocate for the theater and was involved in the establishment of the Théâtre de la République, which was created to promote the works of French playwrights during the Revolution. Louvet de Couvrai also wrote several successful plays himself, including "La Chaumière indienne" and "Le Bon fils". He was a close friend of the actor Talma, who starred in many of his productions.</p><p>Louvet de Couvrai's personal life was also marked by scandal. He had several affairs, including one with the famous actress Mademoiselle Raucourt. He also fathered a child out of wedlock, which caused him many legal and financial troubles. Despite these difficulties, Louvet de Couvrai remained a committed advocate for personal freedom and the rights of individuals to pursue their own happiness.</p><p>Today, Louvet de Couvrai is remembered as an important figure in French literature and history. His literary works continue to be studied and admired, and his political writings and activism have inspired generations of thinkers and activists.

(May 30, 1874		Paris-April 12, 1912)

	
		also known as Dr. Ernest Duchesne

	
was
a French
physician.


					</p><p>During his relatively short life, Duchesne made several important contributions to the field of medicine. He is best known for his discovery of the antibiotic properties of a particular strain of mold, which he called "penicillium glaucum". This discovery predated Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin by over 30 years, but unfortunately, Duchesne's work was largely overlooked at the time.</p><p>In addition to his groundbreaking research on antibiotics, Duchesne also made important contributions to the study of tuberculosis, particularly in the area of immunology. His work helped to establish the importance of the cellular immune response in fighting this disease.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Duchesne's career was cut short by his illness. He died at the age of 37, but his legacy lived on through his research and the work of those he inspired. Today, he is considered one of the great pioneers of modern medicine, and his contributions continue to influence medical research and practice around the world.</p><p>Duchesne was born in a family of doctors, with his father being a prominent surgeon. From a young age, he showed a strong interest in medicine and pursued it as his career. He studied at the Sorbonne, where he obtained degrees in natural sciences and medicine. After completing his studies, Duchesne joined the French Army and served as a medical officer during the First World War. It was during this time that he made his groundbreaking discovery of the antibiotic properties of penicillium glaucum.</p><p>Despite the recognition he received from his colleagues, Duchesne's work went largely unrecognized for many years. It was only after the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in the 1920s that Duchesne's contribution to the field of antibiotics was finally acknowledged.</p><p>In addition to his medical research, Duchesne was also interested in the arts and culture. He was an accomplished piano player and a passionate collector of antique books and manuscripts.</p><p>Despite his short life, Duchesne's work had a profound impact on the field of medicine. Today, he is remembered as a trailblazer in the study of antibiotics and a pioneer in the fight against tuberculosis. His legacy continues to inspire researchers and medical professionals around the world.</p><p>After Duchesne's death, his work on penicillium glaucum was largely forgotten. It wasn't until the 1930s and 1940s that his work was rediscovered and his contributions to the field were fully recognized. In 1944, a year after Fleming was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of penicillin, Duchesne was posthumously awarded the Prix Montyon by the French Academy of Sciences for his pioneering work on antibiotics.</p><p>Despite his relatively short life, Duchesne's legacy has endured. In 1995, the International Society of Chemotherapy established the Duchesne Memorial Lecture, which is given annually in honor of his groundbreaking work in the field of antibiotics. Additionally, in 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the site of Duchesne's former laboratory in Paris, commemorating his contributions to the field of medicine.</p><p>Today, Duchesne serves as a reminder of the power of scientific inquiry, and the importance of recognizing the contributions of those who have come before us. His legacy stands as a testament to the enduring impact of scientific discovery, and the potential for one individual to make a lasting difference in their field.</p><p>Despite his groundbreaking research, Duchesne's discovery was largely overlooked at the time. This was partly due to the fact that he was only 24 years old when he published his findings, and partly because he was not affiliated with a prominent institution. Additionally, his research was conducted on guinea pigs rather than humans, which made it difficult for other physicians to replicate his results.</p><p>Despite the lack of recognition during his lifetime, Duchesne's contribution to the field of antibiotics was groundbreaking. His discovery paved the way for the development of penicillin and other antibiotics, which have saved countless lives over the past century.</p><p>Duchesne's legacy has also had a lasting impact on the field of immunology. His work on tuberculosis helped to establish the importance of the cellular immune response in fighting this disease, which has informed research on other infectious diseases as well.</p><p>Today, Duchesne is recognized as a trailblazer in the field of medicine, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of scientists and researchers. His work serves as a reminder of the importance of perseverance and dedication in the pursuit of scientific discovery.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by tuberculosis.

(August 23, 1867		Chaville-February 12, 1905			Paris)


was
a French
novelist.


					</p><p>He was a prominent figure in the Symbolist movement and is best known for his short stories, which were highly praised by writers such as Jorge Luis Borges, Stefan Zweig, and Paul Valéry. Schwob was a friend and collaborator of Oscar Wilde and translated some of his works into French. In addition to his literary pursuits, Schwob also worked as a librarian and was instrumental in establishing the Bibliothèque de la Ville de Paris (City Library) as one of the premier libraries in France. Despite his early death at the age of 37 from bone cancer, Marcel Schwob left a lasting legacy in French literature and is considered a major influence on the Surrealist and Modernist movements.</p><p>Schwob's literary works often explored themes of the occult, crime, and other macabre subjects. His most famous work, "The Book of Monelle," is a loosely autobiographical novel about his relationship with a young girl named Monelle who serves as a muse of sorts for the author. Schwob was also known for his mastery of various literary styles, experimenting with different forms of writing such as the epistolary novel and the fable. In addition to his literary contributions, Schwob was a political activist who was involved in anarchist circles in Paris. Despite facing censorship and persecution for his political beliefs, Schwob remained committed to social justice and fought against the injustices of his time. Today, he is remembered as one of the most innovative and influential writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p><p>Schwob was born to a wealthy Jewish family and spent much of his childhood traveling around Europe with his parents. He was fluent in several languages, including English, German, Italian, and Spanish, which allowed him to translate works from a variety of different cultures. As a young man, he studied at the École des Chartes in Paris, where he developed his love of literature and history. He later became a professor of French literature at the University of Rennes, but resigned from his position due to his opposition to the French government's treatment of the Dreyfus Affair.</p><p>Throughout his life, Schwob struggled with poor health and financial difficulties, which limited his ability to produce a large body of work. Nevertheless, his short stories, novels, and essays remain highly regarded for their innovative style and themes. In his writing, Schwob often blurred the lines between reality and fantasy, creating works that were both haunting and surreal. His influence can be seen in the work of later writers, such as Jorge Luis Borges, who considered Schwob to be one of his primary influences.</p><p>Despite his impact on French literature, Schwob remained relatively unknown outside of literary circles until the 20th century. Today, his works continue to be read and studied by scholars and literature lovers around the world.</p><p>One notable aspect of Marcel Schwob's style was his use of intertextuality, or referencing and alluding to other texts within his own work. This technique is particularly evident in his short stories, which often drew on historical figures, myths, and legends to create a rich tapestry of literary references. Schwob was also interested in the art of translation, and saw translation not just as a means of rendering a text in another language, but as a way of engaging with and interpreting the original work. This approach to translation is evident in his own translations of works by Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, and other authors.Schwob's legacy has been celebrated in a number of ways, including the establishment of the Marcel Schwob Prize for French literature in his honor. His work has also been adapted into various forms, such as a stage production of "The Book of Monelle" by the British theatre company Shared Experience. Despite his relatively short career, Marcel Schwob left a lasting impression on the literary world, and his innovative style and approach to storytelling continue to inspire writers and readers today.</p><p></p><p>
