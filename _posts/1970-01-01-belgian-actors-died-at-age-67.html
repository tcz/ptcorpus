							Boon was born in Aalst, a small town in the Flemish region of Belgium. He grew up in poverty and left school at the age of 16 to work as a blacksmith apprentice. Despite his lack of formal education, Boon began writing at a young age and became one of the most prolific and influential writers of Flemish literature. He wrote dozens of books, including novels, short stories, and essays, many of which were controversial for their explicit sexual content and social criticism.</p><p>Boon's most famous novel is "De Kapellekensbaan" (The Chapel Road), which was published in 1953. The book is a sprawling, poetic epic about life in a fictional Flemish town and is considered one of the most important works of Flemish literature of the 20th century. Other notable works by Boon include "Mijn Kleine Oorlog" (My Little War), which is a semi-autobiographical account of his experiences during World War II, and "Dagboek 1964-1969" (Diary 1964-1969), which is a collection of his personal notes and observations.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Boon was also a celebrated actor and appeared in several films and television shows. He was known for his outspoken leftist views and his commitment to social justice. Boon died in 1979 at the age of 67, but his legacy as a pioneering writer and activist continues to inspire generations of Flemish and Belgian artists.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=381846" title="Wikipedia article about Louis Paul Boon">Louis Paul Boon on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/belgian-musicians-died-at-age-52.html' title='Belgian musicians died at age 52'><strong>Belgian musicians died at age 52</strong> List of the top 9 Belgian music stars who died when they were 52</a></li><li><a href='/turkish-actors-died-in-1994.html' title='Turkish actors died in 1994'><strong>Turkish actors died in 1994</strong> List of the top 2 Turkish actors who died in 1994</a></li><li><a href='/pakistani-musicians-died-at-age-25.html' title='Pakistani musicians died at age 25'><strong>Pakistani musicians died at age 25</strong> List of the top 4 Pakistani music stars who died when they were 25</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/austrian-musicians-died-at-age-76.html' title='Austrian musicians died at age 76'><strong>Austrian musicians died at age 76</strong> List of the top 26 Austrian music stars who died when they were 76</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-actors-died-in-2011.html' title='Canadian actors died in 2011'><strong>Canadian actors died in 2011</strong> List of the top 10 Canadian actors who died in 2011</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-2002.html' title='Famous actors died in 2002'><strong>Famous actors died in 2002</strong> List of the top 50 Famous actors who died in 2002</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
