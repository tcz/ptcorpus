						</p><p>Milovanoff was born into an aristocratic family in Saint Petersburg and spent the early years of her life in Russia. However, due to political unrest and the Russian Revolution, she and her family were forced to flee to Constantinople (now Istanbul), Turkey. From there, Milovanoff continued her education before eventually moving to Paris where she pursued a career in acting. </p><p>Milovanoff was best known for her work in French cinema during the 1920s and 1930s. She starred in a number of films, including "Le Brasier Ardent" (1923), "La Madone des Sleepings" (1928), and "Le Collier de Montserrat" (1930). Her talent and beauty garnered her many admirers, and she was also something of a fashion icon in Paris during this time. </p><p>Despite her success, Milovanoff's personal life was often tumultuous. She was married several times and had a reputation for being difficult to work with. Following the German occupation of France during World War II, Milovanoff moved to Switzerland, where she lived until her death in 1957. Her legacy as an actor, however, continues to be celebrated today.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/australian-actresses-died-at-age-21.html' title='Australian actresses died at age 21'><strong>Australian actresses died at age 21</strong> List of the top 1 Australian actresses who died when they were 21</a></li><li><a href='/dutch-actors-died-in-esophageal-cancer.html' title='Dutch actors died in Esophageal cancer'><strong>Dutch actors died in Esophageal cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Dutch actors who died in Esophageal cancer</a></li><li><a href='/danish-actresses-died-at-age-55.html' title='Danish actresses died at age 55'><strong>Danish actresses died at age 55</strong> List of the top 2 Danish actresses who died when they were 55</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/chinese-actors-died-in-2001.html' title='Chinese actors died in 2001'><strong>Chinese actors died in 2001</strong> List of the top 1 Chinese actors who died in 2001</a></li><li><a href='/swedish-actors-died-in-1988.html' title='Swedish actors died in 1988'><strong>Swedish actors died in 1988</strong> List of the top 3 Swedish actors who died in 1988</a></li><li><a href='/dutch-actors-died-in-cancer.html' title='Dutch actors died in Cancer'><strong>Dutch actors died in Cancer</strong> List of the top 4 Dutch actors who died in Cancer</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
