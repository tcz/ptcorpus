(April 19, 1882		São Borja-August 24, 1954			Catete Palace)

	
		otherwise known as Getulio Vargas or Getúlio Dornelles Vargas

	
was
a Brazilian
lawyer and politician.


					</p><p>Vargas served as the President of Brazil for two separate terms, first from 1930-1945 as a dictator and then from 1951-1954 as a democratically elected president. During his tenure as a dictator, Vargas enacted policies aimed at modernizing Brazil's economy and strengthening the power of the central government. He also presided over the creation of several important government institutions, including the national oil company Petrobras.</p><p>Despite his authoritarian tendencies, Vargas was also a popular leader who enjoyed support from Brazil's working class and rural poor. He pursued policies aimed at improving their economic situation and expanding access to education and other social programs. Over time, however, Vargas's rule became increasingly controversial, and he faced strong opposition from many political factions.</p><p>Following his overthrow in 1945, Vargas spent several years in exile before being re-elected to the presidency in 1950. During his second term, he faced mounting criticism from both the left and the right, and ultimately chose to take his own life rather than face impeachment. Vargas's legacy is complex: he is remembered as a populist leader who fought for the rights of the disenfranchised, but also as an authoritarian who suppressed dissent and violated civil liberties.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by suicide.
