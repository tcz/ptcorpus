(May 24, 1920		Munich-August 8, 1944)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Friedrich Klausing was a German resistance fighter and member of the anti-Nazi group "Weiße Rose" or "White Rose". Along with his sister, Anneliese, he distributed anti-Nazi leaflets at the University of Munich during World War II. He was arrested in February 1943 and executed the following year at the age of 24. Today, Klausing and his fellow White Rose members are remembered as heroes who stood up against the atrocities of the Nazi regime.</p><p>Before his involvement in the White Rose resistance movement, Friedrich Klausing was studying medicine at the University of Munich. He became disillusioned with the Nazi regime's actions and propaganda, and was inspired to take action against Hitler's regime after seeing the Allied bombing of Munich in 1942. </p><p>Klausing and his sister Anneliese worked with other members of the White Rose group, including Sophie and Hans Scholl, to write and distribute leaflets criticizing the Nazi government and calling for resistance. Their efforts were part of a broader movement of students and intellectuals who sought to resist Hitler's regime from within Germany.</p><p>Klausing was arrested by the Gestapo in February 1943 along with other members of the White Rose group. He was interrogated and tortured but refused to reveal the names of his colleagues or renounce his beliefs. He was ultimately sentenced to death and executed in August 1944.</p><p>In the years since his death, Klausing has been recognized as a hero of the German resistance and a symbol of opposition to Nazi tyranny. The White Rose movement remains an important part of Germany's cultural and historical heritage, and Friedrich Klausing's bravery and sacrifice continue to inspire those fighting for freedom and justice around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(January 29, 1922		Gdańsk-July 4, 1946			Biskupia Górka)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Gerda Steinhoff was a German Nazi concentration camp guard during World War II. She served as a SS Aufseherin at the Stutthof concentration camp near Gdańsk, Poland, where she was responsible for overseeing the brutal persecution, torture, and killings of thousands of prisoners, many of whom were Jewish. In April 1946, Steinhoff was tried and convicted of war crimes by the Polish government and sentenced to death by hanging along with 10 other Stutthof personnel. At her trial, Steinhoff claimed that she was only following orders and was unaware of the true extent of the atrocities being committed. Despite this, she was executed on July 4, 1946, at the Biskupia Górka execution site. Her hanging was one of the first war crimes trials and executions to be carried out in the aftermath of World War II.</p><p>It is believed that Gerda Steinhoff was born in Gdańsk (then known as Danzig), Poland, to German parents. After completing her education, she joined the Nazi Party and became a member of the SS. In 1944, Steinhoff was assigned to the Stutthof concentration camp, which was located near her hometown. During her time at the camp, she was known for her cruelty towards the prisoners, and it is said that she took pleasure in beating and torturing them.</p><p>After the war ended and the Allies liberated the concentration camps, the Polish government set up a special commission to investigate war crimes at Stutthof. Steinhoff and 10 other Stutthof personnel were arrested and charged with crimes against humanity. At her trial, Steinhoff attempted to justify her actions by claiming that she was following orders and was unaware of the true nature of the atrocities being committed. However, her defense was not successful, and she was found guilty and sentenced to death.</p><p>Gerda Steinhoff's execution became a symbol of justice for the victims of the Holocaust and other war crimes. However, it is important to note that many other perpetrators of the Holocaust and other war crimes were never brought to justice. Today, Gerda Steinhoff's story serves as a reminder of the horrors that human beings are capable of inflicting upon each other and the importance of never forgetting the lessons of the past.</p><p></p><p>
						She died caused by hanging.

(October 30, 1887		Jelenia Góra-January 16, 1912			Berlin)


was
a German
novelist.


					</p><p>Georg Heym was not only a novelist, but also a poet and playwright. He was part of the Expressionist movement and is considered one of its most important representatives. Heym's work is known for its dark and surreal imagery, and he often explored themes such as death and decay. Heym's literary career was short-lived, as he died at the age of 24 while attempting to save a friend from drowning in a frozen lake. Despite his young age, he made a significant contribution to German literature and continues to be studied and celebrated today.</p><p>Georg Heym was born in Jelenia Góra, in what is now Poland. He grew up in a middle-class family and studied law at university. However, he quickly became disenchanted with his studies and turned to writing instead. Heym's literary career began in 1909 with the publication of his first collection of poetry, Der ewige Tag (The Eternal Day).</p><p>Heym's second collection of poems, Umbra Vitae (The Shadow of Life), published in 1912, was a departure from his earlier work in that it focused on more apocalyptic themes. Heym believed that the end of the world was imminent and that art had a duty to reflect this impending doom. This belief is reflected in his most famous work, the play Der Dieb (The Thief), which was published posthumously in 1914.</p><p>Heym's work was not widely recognized during his lifetime, and it was only after his death that he began to gain a reputation as one of the leading voices of the Expressionist movement. Today, Heym is celebrated for his unique blend of surrealism and social commentary, and his works continue to be studied and performed by scholars and artists alike.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by drowning.

(October 7, 1923		Feldberger Seenlandschaft-December 13, 1945			Hamelin)


was
a German
politician.


					</p><p>This is incorrect. Irma Grese was actually a female SS guard at the Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps during the Holocaust. She was known for her cruelty towards prisoners, often beating and torturing them. She was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Belsen trial, and was subsequently sentenced to death by hanging on December 13, 1945.

was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a leftist militant and a member of the anarchist group "2nd of June Movement" in West Berlin during the 1970s. Rauch was involved in several terrorist attacks, including the bombing of a police station in 1971. He was eventually tracked down by the police and killed during a shootout in a café in Schöneberg. Rauch's death sparked widespread controversy and led to protests and riots in West Berlin. Today, he is remembered as a symbol of the radical leftist movement in Germany during the Cold War era.</p><p>Georg von Rauch was born into a wealthy family but chose to reject his privileged background and became involved in left-wing activism at an early age. He participated in student protests in the late 1960s, which were part of a broader youth movement in West Germany that challenged the conservative government and the status quo. Rauch joined the 2nd of June Movement, which was named after the day of the 1967 shooting of an unarmed student by a police officer in West Berlin. The group was committed to armed struggle against the state and the capitalist system.</p><p>Rauch was known among his comrades for his dedication, bravery, and ideological commitment. He was involved in several bank robberies and bombings, including the attack on the police station in which one officer was killed and several others injured. Rauch's involvement in such violent acts made him a prime target of the authorities, who saw the 2nd of June Movement as a serious threat to national security.</p><p>Rauch's death at the age of 24 was a major blow to the left-wing movement in West Germany. His funeral was attended by thousands of mourners, who saw him as a martyr for the cause of social justice and revolutionary change. The 2nd of June Movement continued to carry out attacks in the years following Rauch's death, but it gradually lost support and influence as the political climate in Germany shifted in the 1980s. Today, Georg von Rauch is remembered as a controversial figure who embodied the radicalism and idealism of a generation that sought to challenge the established order and build a more just society.</p><p></p><p>
