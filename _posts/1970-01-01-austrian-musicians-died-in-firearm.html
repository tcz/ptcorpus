						Anton Webern was part of the Second Viennese School alongside Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. He studied music theory and composition with Schoenberg and eventually became his disciple. Webern's compositions were characterized by their brevity, often lasting only a few minutes, and their highly structured, serialist approach to composition. He also conducted and taught music throughout his career. Webern's life and career were cut short when he was accidentally shot and killed by an American army soldier shortly after the end of World War II. Despite his short career and tragic death, Webern is widely regarded as one of the most important composers of the 20th century.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=65676" title="Wikipedia article about Anton Webern">Anton Webern on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/motswana-musicians-died-at-age-59.html' title='Motswana musicians died at age 59'><strong>Motswana musicians died at age 59</strong> List of the top 1 Motswana music stars who died when they were 59</a></li><li><a href='/finnish-actors-died-at-age-47.html' title='Finnish actors died at age 47'><strong>Finnish actors died at age 47</strong> List of the top 1 Finnish actors who died when they were 47</a></li><li><a href='/belgian-musicians-died-at-age-78.html' title='Belgian musicians died at age 78'><strong>Belgian musicians died at age 78</strong> List of the top 24 Belgian music stars who died when they were 78</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/german-actors-died-in-1973.html' title='German actors died in 1973'><strong>German actors died in 1973</strong> List of the top 5 German actors who died in 1973</a></li><li><a href='/english-actors-died-in-cerebral-thrombosis.html' title='English actors died in Cerebral thrombosis'><strong>English actors died in Cerebral thrombosis</strong> List of the top 1 English actors who died in Cerebral thrombosis</a></li><li><a href='/dutch-musicians-died-in-lung-cancer.html' title='Dutch musicians died in Lung cancer'><strong>Dutch musicians died in Lung cancer</strong> List of the top 4 Dutch music stars who died in Lung cancer</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
