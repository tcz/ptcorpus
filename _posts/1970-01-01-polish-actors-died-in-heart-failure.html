						</p><p>He began his acting career in the early 1920s in Poland and eventually moved to Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), Russia in 1927 where he continued his career on stage and in film. Adashevsky was known for his performances in classical plays, particularly in the works of William Shakespeare. He worked with some of the most renowned theater directors of his time and became a respected figure in Soviet theater. In addition to his stage work, Adashevsky appeared in over 50 films throughout his career. He was awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR in 1950 and continued to act until his death in 1987.</p><p>Adashevsky was born into a Polish-Jewish family and grew up in Kalisz, Poland. He initially trained to become a lawyer but ultimately decided to pursue a career in acting. He studied at the Warsaw School of Drama and earned his stage debut in 1918. For a brief time, he was a member of the Vilna Troupe, a Jewish theater company known for its experimental productions.</p><p>After moving to Leningrad in 1927, Adashevsky quickly became a prominent figure in St. Petersburg's theater scene. He worked with directors like Nikolai Akimov and Georgy Tovstonogov on productions of classics like "Hamlet" and "King Lear". In 1941, when the city was besieged by the German army during World War II, Adashevsky and his colleagues continued to perform in makeshift theaters despite the danger.</p><p>Throughout his film career, Adashevsky appeared in a variety of genres, including dramas, comedies, and historical epics. He often portrayed wise or fatherly characters, but also had the range to play villains and antiheroes. Some of his most notable films include "The Great Citizen", "The Return of Vasili Bortnikov", and "The Marriage".</p><p>Adashevsky was married twice and had two children. His son, Pyotr Adashevsky, also became an actor. Konstantin Adashevsky died in Leningrad in 1987 at the age of 90. He is remembered as an accomplished actor who made significant contributions to both Polish and Soviet theater and film.</p><p>Despite being born into a Jewish family, Adashevsky was a lifelong atheist and did not practice any religion. He was also known to be an avid collector of books and had a personal library containing over 10,000 volumes. In addition to his work in acting, Adashevsky also taught at the Leningrad State Institute of Theater, Music, and Cinematography for several years. He was a respected mentor to many aspiring actors and directors. In 1967, Adashevsky was awarded the Order of Lenin, one of the highest civilian awards in the Soviet Union. He continued to perform on stage and screen well into his 80s, and remained a beloved figure in the theater community until his death.</p><p>Adashevsky's contributions to theater were not limited to acting alone. He also dabbled in directing and worked as an artistic director for theaters in Leningrad. He directed his first play, "Richard III", in 1944 and went on to direct several more productions over the years. As an artistic director, he was responsible for selecting plays and overseeing their production. He held this position at various theaters throughout Leningrad and was known for his keen eye for talent.</p><p>Adashevsky's legacy continues to live on in the many actors and directors he mentored over the years. His influence on Soviet theater and film cannot be understated, and his performances in classics like "Hamlet" and "King Lear" are still regarded as some of the best in Russian theater history. His dedication to the craft of acting and his tireless efforts to promote theater as an art form have earned him a place in the pantheon of great actors and directors.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-2011.html' title='American actors died in 2011'><strong>American actors died in 2011</strong> List of the top 50 American actors who died in 2011</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actors-died-in-2014.html' title='Indian actors died in 2014'><strong>Indian actors died in 2014</strong> List of the top 13 Indian actors who died in 2014</a></li><li><a href='/german-actors-born-in-1927.html' title='German actors born in 1927'><strong>German actors born in 1927</strong> List of the top 13 German actors who were born in 1927</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/czechoslovakian-actors-died-in-1981.html' title='Czechoslovakian actors died in 1981'><strong>Czechoslovakian actors died in 1981</strong> List of the top 3 Czechoslovakian actors who died in 1981</a></li><li><a href='/south-korean-musicians-died-at-age-80.html' title='South Korean musicians died at age 80'><strong>South Korean musicians died at age 80</strong> List of the top 1 South Korean music stars who died when they were 80</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actors-died-at-age-46.html' title='Indian actors died at age 46'><strong>Indian actors died at age 46</strong> List of the top 3 Indian actors who died when they were 46</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
