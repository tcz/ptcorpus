		also known as Cheng Gu

	
was
a Chinese
poet, essayist and novelist.


					
			
		His child
		is
		
		Gu Mu Er.

						</p><p>Gu Cheng was a prominent figure in the Chinese literary scene during the early 1980s. Some of his notable works include the poetry collections "The Sea" and "The Grass". He also wrote several novels and essays, commenting on the social and political issues of the time. </p><p>Gu Cheng left China with his wife Xie Ye in 1987, as part of a wave of Chinese intellectuals seeking greater artistic and personal freedom overseas. They first settled in New Zealand, where they had a son, Gu Mu Er. However, their relationship deteriorated and ended in a tragic murder-suicide, with Xie Ye killing their son before taking her own life. Gu Cheng subsequently took his own life, leaving behind a legacy of poignant and influential writing.</p><p>Gu Cheng was born into a family of artists and writers in Beijing. His father, Gu Gong, was a well-known painter, and his mother, Zhang Zhaohe, was a writer and translator. Growing up in this environment, Gu Cheng developed a love of literature and an appreciation for the arts.</p><p>Gu Cheng began writing at a young age and became involved in the literary scene while still in high school. After the Cultural Revolution, he attended the prestigious Beijing Language and Culture University, where he studied literature.</p><p>In the early 1980s, Gu Cheng became one of the key figures in the Chinese literary movement known as the "Misty Poets". This group of writers was known for their avant-garde, experimental style, which often veered away from traditional Chinese poetic forms.</p><p>In addition to his literary work, Gu Cheng was also active in social and political issues. He was critical of the Chinese government and its policies, and he expressed his views openly in his writing.</p><p>After leaving China, Gu Cheng and his wife Xie Ye settled in Auckland, New Zealand, where they had a son, Gu Mu Er. Gu Cheng continued to write and publish, but his personal life became increasingly turbulent. His relationship with Xie Ye was strained, and they separated several times before the tragic events that led to their deaths.</p><p>Despite the tragic end to his life, Gu Cheng's legacy lives on through his writing. He is remembered as one of China's greatest and most influential writers of the 20th century.</p><p>Gu Cheng's writing was marked by a sense of melancholy and a deep appreciation for the natural world. The sea and the grass, in particular, were recurring themes in his poetry. He also experimented with different literary forms, such as prose poetry, and incorporated elements of traditional Chinese culture into his work. </p><p>Gu Cheng's impact on Chinese literature was significant. His writing represented a departure from the more rigid, traditional forms of poetry that had dominated Chinese literature for centuries. His works were influential in shaping the "Misty Poetry" movement and inspiring a new generation of experimental poets.</p><p>After Gu Cheng's death, his literary contributions continued to be celebrated. In 1995, he was posthumously awarded the Chinese Literature Media Award for his poetry, and in 1999, a collection of his poems was included in the Chinese Literature Classics series. Today, his works continue to be widely read and studied both in China and around the world.</p><p></p><p>
