(January 29, 1905		New York City-July 4, 1970			New York City)


was
an American
artist, painter and visual artist.


					</p><p>Newman is best known for his abstract expressionist paintings, particularly his large works which feature "zips," or vertical lines dividing the canvas. He was largely self-taught as an artist, and began seriously exploring painting in the late 1930s. His work was influenced by the abstract styles of other artists of his time, including Mark Rothko and Ad Reinhardt. Newman's paintings were initially met with mixed reviews, but he became increasingly recognized as a leading figure in the art world in the 1950s and 1960s. Today, his works are widely celebrated for their elemental, graphic quality and for their contribution to the development of abstract expressionism.</p><p>In addition to his painting, Newman was a prolific writer and art theorist. He often published essays and manifestos discussing the importance of abstract art, and was a founding member of the Artists' Club, a forum for discussing new developments in the art world. Newman also had a deep interest in myth and primitive art, which he believed could provide a framework for understanding modern art. In the 1960s, he began experimenting with sculpture as well, creating large, monolithic works that echoed the scale and simplicity of his paintings. Today, his works are featured in major museums across the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate Modern in London. Newman is considered one of America's most important abstract expressionist painters.</p><p></p><p>

		children,
		Iris Careen von Braun, Peter Constantine von Braun and Margrit Cécile von Braun.

						</p><p>Von Braun was one of the leading figures in the Nazi rocket program during World War II, and was responsible for designing and developing the V-2 rocket. After the war, he surrendered to the Americans and was brought to the United States to work on the development of rockets for the U.S. military. He played a key role in the development of the Saturn V rocket, which was used in the Apollo program to send astronauts to the moon. Von Braun was a prolific author, and wrote several books on space exploration and rocketry during his career. Despite his contributions to space exploration, von Braun's involvement in the Nazi regime has been a source of controversy throughout his life and after his death.</p><p>Von Braun was born in Wyrzysk, then in the German Empire (now in Poland). He grew up in a family of aristocrats and was inspired by space exploration at a young age. After completing his education in Germany, he began working for the German Army in developing rocket technology. During World War II, von Braun oversaw the development of the V-2 rocket, which was used to attack London and other Allied cities. Following the war, he was recruited by the United States military as part of Operation Paperclip, which aimed to bring top German scientists to the United States to work on the space program.</p><p>Von Braun went on to work for NASA, where he played a key role in developing the Saturn V rocket. He was also instrumental in the Apollo program, which successfully landed astronauts on the moon. His work on rocket technology helped to establish the United States' position as a leader in space exploration.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, von Braun faced criticism for his involvement in the Nazi regime during the war. Some of his colleagues accused him of mistreating forced laborers who worked on the V-2 rocket, and he was never fully exonerated from his wartime activities. Nevertheless, his contributions to the field of rocket science continue to be celebrated, and he remains a controversial and complex figure in the history of space exploration.</p><p></p><p>

was
an American
writer.


					</p><p>Cotton Mather was a prominent Puritan minister, theologian, and scholar who played an important role in the cultural and intellectual development of colonial New England. He wrote over 400 works, including sermons, religious tracts, and historical accounts, and was a strong advocate for the use of science and medicine in the treatment of illness. Mather also gained notoriety for his involvement in the Salem witch trials, during which he advocated for the execution of those accused of witchcraft. Despite his controversial legacy, Mather was a celebrated figure in his own time, and his writings helped shape the religious and intellectual landscape of early America.</p><p>Mather was born into a family of notable New Englanders, with his father and three grandfathers all having served as ministers. He graduated from Harvard College at the age of 15 and went on to receive his master's and doctorate degrees from the same institution. Mather's interests were wide-ranging and included topics such as medicine, natural history, and biblical studies. He corresponded with many of the leading intellectuals of his day, both in Europe and in the American colonies.</p><p>One of Mather's most important works was "Magnalia Christi Americana," a chronicle of the history of New England from its founding to the late 17th century, which included biographies of notable figures such as John Winthrop and Increase Mather, Cotton's father. Mather also wrote extensively on religious subjects, including sermons and treatises on topics such as the nature of God and the importance of faith.</p><p>Mather's involvement in the Salem witch trials has overshadowed much of his other work. He initially supported the trials and even vigorously defended their legality, but later expressed regret for his role in the affair. Despite this, Mather's reputation suffered in the wake of the trials, and he was often criticized for his involvement.</p><p>Despite his sometimes controversial legacy, Mather was widely respected during his lifetime and remained a prominent figure in New England intellectual circles until his death. His works were influential in shaping the religious and intellectual landscape of early America, and many of them remain important historical documents to this day.</p><p></p><p>
