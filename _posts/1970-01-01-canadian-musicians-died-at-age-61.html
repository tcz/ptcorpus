						</p><p>Layton was the leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) of Canada from 2003 until his death in 2011.

After his death, he was remembered fondly by politicians and citizens from across the political spectrum for his commitment to his values and his dedication to public service.</p><p>Layton was born into a family of politicians - his grandfather, also named Jack Layton, was a cabinet minister in the Duplessis government in Quebec. Layton himself entered politics at the young age of 22, when he was elected president of his student union. After completing his PhD in political science at York University, he became a professor at Ryerson University in Toronto. He was first elected to Toronto City Council in 1982, and became known for his advocacy for affordable housing and public transit.

(December 24, 1879		Montreal-November 18, 1941			Montreal)

	
		also known as Emile Nelligan

	
was
a Canadian
writer and poet.


					</p><p>Despite publishing only a small body of work, Nelligan is considered one of the most important poets in Canadian literature. He was known for his intense and emotional verse, which was influenced by the French Symbolist movement. Nelligan's most famous work is the collection of poems entitled "Paysages tristes" (Sad Landscapes), which he published at the age of 20. However, his troubled mental state eventually led to him being institutionalized at the age of 21 and he spent the majority of his life in mental institutions. Despite this, his work has had a lasting impact on Canadian literature and he remains a celebrated figure in Quebec culture.</p><p>Nelligan was born in Montreal to a family of Irish and French Canadian descent. He began writing poetry from a young age and was known for his prodigious talent. At the age of 16, he began studying at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, but dropped out after a year to focus on his writing. In 1899, he published his first collection of poetry, "Juvenilia," which drew critical acclaim and established his reputation as a promising new voice in Canadian literature.</p><p>However, Nelligan's mental health began to deteriorate shortly thereafter. He experienced increasingly frequent episodes of psychosis and delirium, and was ultimately committed to a mental institution in 1899 at the age of 21. Despite brief periods of remission, he was never able to fully recover and remained institutionalized for the rest of his life. </p><p>During his time in the institution, Nelligan continued to write poetry prolifically, yet struggled to gain recognition for his work. It was only after his death in 1941 that his poetry began to be rediscovered and celebrated as a major contribution to Canadian literature.</p><p>Today, Nelligan is remembered as one of the most talented and important poets in the history of Quebec and Canadian literature. His work continues to resonate with readers for its emotional intensity, striking imagery, and visionary lyricism, and has inspired generations of writers and artists.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1793-July 15, 1854			St. François Xavier, Manitoba)


was
a Canadian
personality.


					</p><p>He is known for his role as a Métis leader and his involvement in the Pemmican War, also known as the Battle of Seven Oaks. Grant is considered one of the key figures in the Métis Nation's history for his leadership in establishing a provisional government in 1816. He was also instrumental in securing land rights for the Métis through negotiations with the Hudson's Bay Company. In addition to his efforts as a leader and negotiator, Grant was an entrepreneur who established a successful fur trading business. He is remembered as a pioneering figure in the history of Western Canada and is celebrated for his contributions to the Métis Nation.</p><p>Cuthbert Grant was born in Fort La Reine, present-day Manitoba, to a Scottish father and Cree mother. He grew up speaking both English and Cree and developed a deep understanding and appreciation for both cultures. In 1812, at the age of 19, Grant began working as a fur trader for the North West Company. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled negotiator and leader among the Métis community.</p><p>In 1816, Grant led the Métis in establishing a provisional government, known as the Métis National Committee. The committee was formed in response to the Hudson's Bay Company's attempts to increase their control over the fur trade and limit the Métis' access to pemmican, a staple food for the fur traders. The committee asserted Métis sovereignty over the Red River Valley and negotiated directly with the Hudson's Bay Company to secure rights to the land.</p><p>Grant's leadership during the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816 solidified his position as a key figure in Métis history. During the battle, a group of Métis and First Nations people clashed with the Hudson's Bay Company over access to pemmican. The confrontation resulted in the deaths of 21 people, including the governor of the colony of Assiniboia. While Grant was not directly involved in the violence, he was present during the incident and its aftermath.</p><p>After the battle, Grant continued to work as a fur trader and established his own successful business. He also played a crucial role in negotiating the terms of the Treaty of Fort Garry in 1870, which secured Métis land rights in the Red River Valley.</p><p>Today, Cuthbert Grant is remembered as an important figure in Métis history and a symbol of Métis resistance and resilience. His legacy continues to inspire and inform the Métis Nation's ongoing struggles for self-determination and recognition.</p><p></p><p>
