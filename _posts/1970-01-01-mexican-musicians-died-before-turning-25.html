At the time of his death, he was preparing for a rematch with Azumah Nelson, a fight many boxing fans were eagerly anticipating. Despite his relatively short career, Sanchez's impact on boxing continues to be felt even today. Many boxers have cited him as one of their greatest inspirations, and his style in the ring is still studied and emulated by young boxers hoping to make a name for themselves in the sport. In addition to his work with the Salvador Sanchez Foundation, a biographical film about his life titled "Salvador" was released in 1986. The film starred James Belushi, who played Sanchez's manager and friend.
