							Valentino was born in Castellaneta, Italy and immigrated to the United States in 1913. He began his career as a dancer in New York City before moving to Hollywood to pursue acting. He quickly became a heartthrob and sex symbol in silent films, starring in hit movies such as "The Sheik" and "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse." Valentino was known for his exoticism and sensuality on screen, which drew criticism from conservative groups. He was also fiercely private about his personal life, which only fueled rumors and speculation. Valentino died tragically at the age of 31 from complications of peritonitis, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most iconic and beloved actors in Hollywood history.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=45396" title="Wikipedia article about Rudolph Valentino">Rudolph Valentino on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/filipino-actresses-died-in-1998.html' title='Filipino actresses died in 1998'><strong>Filipino actresses died in 1998</strong> List of the top 1 Filipino actresses who died in 1998</a></li><li><a href='/bulgarian-actors-born-in-1972.html' title='Bulgarian actors born in 1972'><strong>Bulgarian actors born in 1972</strong> List of the top 5 Bulgarian actors who were born in 1972</a></li><li><a href='/albanian-actors-died-in-1999.html' title='Albanian actors died in 1999'><strong>Albanian actors died in 1999</strong> List of the top 1 Albanian actors who died in 1999</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/slovak-actors-died-at-age-73.html' title='Slovak actors died at age 73'><strong>Slovak actors died at age 73</strong> List of the top 2 Slovak actors who died when they were 73</a></li><li><a href='/hungarian-actors-died-in-1999.html' title='Hungarian actors died in 1999'><strong>Hungarian actors died in 1999</strong> List of the top 3 Hungarian actors who died in 1999</a></li><li><a href='/pakistani-actors-died-in-2005.html' title='Pakistani actors died in 2005'><strong>Pakistani actors died in 2005</strong> List of the top 2 Pakistani actors who died in 2005</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
