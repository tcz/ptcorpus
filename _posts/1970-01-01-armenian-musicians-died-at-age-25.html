an Armenian
personality.


					</p><p>Margaryan was a young man who studied at the Yerevan State University in Armenia. He was an accomplished athlete and had won multiple medals in wrestling and judo. He was also fluent in multiple languages, including Armenian, Russian, English, and Hungarian. Margaryan was working on his Ph.D. in computer science and was a promising student with a bright future ahead of him.</p><p>Unfortunately, his life was cut short when he was brutally murdered in his dormitory room in Budapest by Ramil Safarov, an Azerbaijani army officer. The murder was committed during a NATO-sponsored training program for military officers from Armenia, Azerbaijan, and other countries, and Margaryan was the only Armenian participant.</p><p>The shocking murder sent shockwaves throughout the Armenian community, which regarded the killing as an act of hate and aggression towards their nation. The incident strained diplomatic relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan and received international attention.</p><p>Despite the tragedy, Margaryan's legacy lives on, and he is remembered for his talent, intelligence, and his untimely death as a victim of hate.</p><p>Following Gurgen Margaryan's murder, there were several protests and demonstrations held by the Armenian community, demanding justice for Margaryan and his family. The perpetrator, Ramil Safarov, was eventually arrested and sentenced to life in prison in Hungary for the murder. In a shocking turn of events, however, Safarov was later extradited to Azerbaijan in 2012, where he was immediately pardoned by the Azerbaijani government and given a hero's welcome upon his return. This move was widely condemned internationally and seen as a slap in the face to the Armenian community.</p><p>In memory of Gurgen Margaryan, the Armenian government established an annual scholarship program in his name to support young Armenians pursuing higher education in the field of computer science. Margaryan's family also started a foundation in his name aimed at promoting peace and tolerance between different cultures and nations.</p><p>Gurgen Margaryan's tragic death has become a symbol of the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan and a reminder of the importance of working towards peaceful solutions and promoting understanding and tolerance among different communities.</p><p></p><p>
