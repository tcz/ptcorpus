Moór died at the age of 68 in Chardonne, Switzerland.</p><p>Moór's interest in music and engineering began at a young age. He studied music in Vienna and then at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, where he also obtained a degree in engineering. Moór's Moór System for piano keyboards was patented in 1901 and was widely adopted by many famous pianists, including Claude Debussy, who praised the system's ability to produce greater harmonic clarity and faster finger agility.</p><p>In addition to his music and engineering work, Moór was also an entrepreneur.
