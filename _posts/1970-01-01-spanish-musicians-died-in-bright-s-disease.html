						Isaac Albéniz was born in Camprodon, Catalonia, Spain, and began studying piano at a young age with his father, who was also a musician. His family moved to Paris when he was a child, and he continued his musical education there. Albéniz composed his first works at the age of seven and gave his first public performance as a pianist at the age of nine. He later traveled extensively throughout Europe and South America, performing as a concert pianist and composing music inspired by his travels.</p><p>Albéniz was known for his use of Spanish folk melodies and rhythms in his compositions, which were influenced by the traditional music of his homeland. His most famous work is the suite for piano, Iberia, which consists of twelve pieces inspired by different regions of Spain. Albéniz also composed operas, chamber music, and orchestral works, though he is primarily remembered for his piano music.</p><p>Albéniz's influence on Spanish music is far-reaching, and his works have been arranged for various instruments and ensembles. He died of Bright's disease at the age of 48, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire musicians and audiences around the world.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=15208" title="Wikipedia article about Isaac Albéniz">Isaac Albéniz on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/georgian-actors-died-in-1995.html' title='Georgian actors died in 1995'><strong>Georgian actors died in 1995</strong> List of the top 1 Georgian actors who died in 1995</a></li><li><a href='/mexican-musicians-died-in-hemiplegia.html' title='Mexican musicians died in Hemiplegia'><strong>Mexican musicians died in Hemiplegia</strong> List of the top 1 Mexican music stars who died in Hemiplegia</a></li><li><a href='/pakistani-actresses-died-in-2002.html' title='Pakistani actresses died in 2002'><strong>Pakistani actresses died in 2002</strong> List of the top 1 Pakistani actresses who died in 2002</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/pakistani-actors-died-at-age-44.html' title='Pakistani actors died at age 44'><strong>Pakistani actors died at age 44</strong> List of the top 1 Pakistani actors who died when they were 44</a></li><li><a href='/bulgarian-musicians-died-at-age-47.html' title='Bulgarian musicians died at age 47'><strong>Bulgarian musicians died at age 47</strong> List of the top 1 Bulgarian music stars who died when they were 47</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-musicians-born-in-1987.html' title='Japanese musicians born in 1987'><strong>Japanese musicians born in 1987</strong> List of the top 50 Japanese  music stars who died in who were born in 1987</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
