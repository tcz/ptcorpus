						Scotty, whose real name was David Scott, was born on February 11, 1949, in Kingston, Jamaica. He started his career as a performer in the mid-1960s, working as a disc jockey for several sound systems in Jamaica. Scotty gained popularity in the 1970s with his unique singing style, which blended soulful vocals and toasting (a form of Jamaican rap).</p><p>In 1972, Scotty released his debut album "Schooldays," which was followed by "Unbelievable Sounds" in 1973. However, it was his appearance on the soundtrack for the cult classic film "The Harder They Come" in 1972, with his hit song "Draw Your Brakes," that cemented his place in reggae history.</p><p>Scotty continued to release music throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including the album "The Jiffy Cornbread Experience" in 1982. He also collaborated with other reggae artists such as The Crystalites, The Aggrovators, and The Skatalites.</p><p>Scotty passed away on February 27, 2003, at the age of 54. However, his music continues to be influential to this day, as many contemporary reggae artists cite him as a major inspiration.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=6129702" title="Wikipedia article about Scotty">Scotty on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/egyptian-actors-died-in-emphysema.html' title='Egyptian actors died in Emphysema'><strong>Egyptian actors died in Emphysema</strong> List of the top 1 Egyptian actors who died in Emphysema</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-actors-died-in-2000.html' title='Canadian actors died in 2000'><strong>Canadian actors died in 2000</strong> List of the top 7 Canadian actors who died in 2000</a></li><li><a href='/greek-actors-died-in-1977.html' title='Greek actors died in 1977'><strong>Greek actors died in 1977</strong> List of the top 2 Greek actors who died in 1977</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/german-actors-died-in-1998.html' title='German actors died in 1998'><strong>German actors died in 1998</strong> List of the top 9 German actors who died in 1998</a></li><li><a href='/irish-musicians-died-at-age-70.html' title='Irish musicians died at age 70'><strong>Irish musicians died at age 70</strong> List of the top 17 Irish music stars who died when they were 70</a></li><li><a href='/french-actors-died-in-2013.html' title='French actors died in 2013'><strong>French actors died in 2013</strong> List of the top 12 French actors who died in 2013</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
