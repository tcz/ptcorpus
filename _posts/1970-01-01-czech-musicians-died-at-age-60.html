		a.k.a. Bohumir Smeral

	
was
a Czech
personality.


					</p><p>He was a Marxist politician who co-founded the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, which later split into the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Czech Social Democratic Party. Šmeral was a strong advocate for the rights of the working class and believed in the power of revolutionary socialism to create a more just society. He was imprisoned multiple times for his political activities, but continued to fight for his ideals throughout his life. Šmeral eventually moved to the Soviet Union, where he died in 1941.</p><p>After the foundation of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Šmeral served as its chairman from 1921 to 1925. During this time, he participated in several international communist activities and served as a delegate to the Comintern. In addition to his political activities, Šmeral was also a prolific writer, penning several books and articles on topics such as Marxist theory and the history of the working class movement in Czechoslovakia.

After the Czechoslovak Republic was founded in 1918, the party became one of the leading political forces in the country. However, Šmeral's advocacy of a more radical socialist agenda eventually led to a split in the party, with some members forming the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.</p><p>Despite his imprisonment and trials, Šmeral continued to work for the cause of communism and socialism. In 1937, he was expelled from the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia for his opposition to the party's tactics, but he remained committed to the socialist cause.</p><p>In March 1939, Germany occupied Czechoslovakia and Šmeral was forced to flee to the Soviet Union. He died in Moscow in 1941, after suffering a heart attack.</p><p>Šmeral's legacy continues to be contested, with some seeing him as a courageous and principled fighter for workers' rights, while others view him as a misguided ideologue who contributed to the rise of communism in Czechoslovakia. Regardless of one's opinion of him, however, there is no denying Šmeral's impact on Czechoslovakian politics and his role in shaping the country's history.</p><p></p><p>
