						</p><p>Andrew III of Hungary, also known as Andrew the Venetian, was the King of Hungary and Croatia from 1290 until his death in 1301. He was the son of Stephen the Posthumous and the grandson of King Béla IV. Andrew became king after a disputed succession following the death of his cousin, Ladislaus IV. He faced several challenges during his reign, including wars with neighboring countries and internal struggles with the nobility. </p><p>Andrew was known for his patronage of the arts and sciences and is credited with establishing the first university in Hungary, the University of Pécs. He was also a supporter of the Dominican Order and is said to have been buried in their habit. </p><p>Despite having only one child, Elizabeth of Töss, Andrew III had many illegitimate children, some of whom became significant figures in the politics of the Kingdom of Hungary. Andrew’s legacy is still debated among historians, with some praising his contributions to culture and education, while others criticize his leadership style and inability to unite the kingdom.</p><p>Andrew III was born in Venice on April 5, 1265, where his mother, Tomasina Morosini, sought refuge after her husband's death. He spent much of his early life in Venice and was raised in the Italian court. In 1278, at the age of 13, he was declared Duke of Slavonia by his grandfather, King Béla IV. After his grandfather's death, Andrew's father, Stephen the Posthumous, was proclaimed king, but he died a few months later, leaving Andrew as the only legitimate heir to the throne.</p><p>Andrew's ascension to the throne was not without controversy, as his cousin, Ladislaus IV, had named his own successor before his death. Andrew's claim to the throne was supported by the powerful Árpád dynasty and by the Pope, who saw him as a potential ally in the ongoing struggle against the Byzantine Empire.</p><p>As king, Andrew faced several challenges, including wars with neighboring countries, such as Austria and Poland, and internal struggles with the nobility. He attempted to strengthen the monarchy by curbing the power of the nobles, but his efforts were largely unsuccessful.</p><p>Andrew was a patron of the arts and sciences and is credited with establishing the first university in Hungary, the University of Pécs. He was also a supporter of the Dominican Order and is said to have been buried in their habit.</p><p>Andrew III died on January 14, 1301, in Buda, Hungary, at the age of 35. Despite having only one legitimate child, Andrew had many illegitimate children, some of whom became significant figures in the politics of the Kingdom of Hungary. His legacy is still debated among historians, with some praising his contributions to culture and education, while others criticize his leadership style and inability to unite the kingdom.</p><p>During his reign, Andrew III also faced a threat from a group of Czech and German miners known as the Cistercian Order, who rebelled against the Kingdom of Hungary in a series of uprisings. Andrew III sent troops to suppress the revolts, but they were ultimately unsuccessful. The Cistercian Order was eventually defeated by a coalition of Hungarian nobles, led by the powerful magnate, Amade Aba.</p><p>Andrew III was known for his interest in astrology and the occult, and he was rumored to have consulted with astrologers and fortune tellers to help guide his decisions. He was also known for his love of hunting and falconry, and for his patronage of artists and writers. One of his most significant cultural contributions was the commissioning of the famous Anjou Bible, a lavish illuminated manuscript that is now housed in the National Library of Hungary.</p><p>Despite his mixed legacy, Andrew III is remembered as an important figure in Hungarian history and as one of the few kings who attempted to modernize the country and establish a strong centralized government. His reign marked the end of the Árpád dynasty and the beginning of a new era in Hungarian history.</p><p></p><p>
