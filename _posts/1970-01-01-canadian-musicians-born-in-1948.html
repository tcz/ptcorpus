(April 14, 1948		Montreal-March 7, 1983			Paris)

	
		also known as Vivier, Claude

	
was
a Canadian
composer.


						</p><p>He studied at Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal followed by a period of study in Europe before settling in Paris in the mid-1970s. </p><p>Vivier's music is characterized by his use of unconventional instruments and his exploration of spirituality in his compositions. He was openly gay and his works often dealt with themes of homosexuality and death. </p><p>Tragically, Vivier was murdered in his Parisian apartment in 1983 at the age of 34 by a man he had picked up at a bar. Despite his early death, he is considered one of the most important composers of his generation and his works continue to be performed and studied around the world.</p><p>Vivier's early works were heavily influenced by the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, and he later incorporated the musique concrète techniques he learned while studying with Gilles Tremblay. His compositions often featured mystical, otherworldly elements and incorporated a diverse range of instruments such as the maracas and gamelan. Vivier was also known for experimenting with unconventional vocal techniques, such as throat singing and overtone singing.</p><p>Shortly before his death, Vivier composed his final work, "Glaubst du an die Unsterblichkeit der Seele" ("Do you believe in the immortality of the soul"), which was inspired by his own personal experiences and beliefs about death and the afterlife. The piece was premiered posthumously in 1983 and has since become one of his most recognized works.</p><p>In addition to his music, Vivier was also an accomplished poet and writer, and many of his writings were incorporated into his compositions. His legacy continues to inspire contemporary composers, and his music has been featured in numerous festivals and performances worldwide, solidifying his place as one of the most important and innovative composers of the 20th century.</p><p>Vivier's personal life was just as fascinating as his music. Despite being openly gay at a time when it was not widely accepted, he was known for his charisma and charm. He had many relationships throughout his life, including a brief fling with German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, who was a major influence on Vivier's style. Vivier also had a complicated relationship with his mother, who he once said was "the only person on this planet I both hate and love." Despite their rocky relationship, Vivier's mother played a significant role in his life, first introducing him to music by taking him to see operas as a child.</p><p>In addition to his musical accomplishments, Vivier was also known for his eccentric personality and love of travel. He often went on long journeys to exotic locations such as Bali and India, where he would immerse himself in the local culture and draw inspiration for his compositions. His travels also provided him with an escape from his tumultuous personal life and a chance to explore his spirituality.</p><p>Since his death, Vivier's music has continued to gain recognition and acclaim, with many contemporary composers citing him as a major influence. His unique style and willingness to experiment with unconventional instruments and vocal techniques continue to inspire new generations of musicians. In 2017, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra released an album featuring several of Vivier's works, further cementing his legacy as one of Canada's most important cultural figures.</p><p>Vivier's legacy has also been celebrated through various honors and awards. In 1982, he was awarded the Prix Serge-Garant, a prestigious prize for Canadian composers. The following year, after his death, he was posthumously awarded the Calixa-Lavallée Award, which recognizes outstanding contributions to Canadian music. In 2002, the Canadian Music Centre established the Claude Vivier Award, which is awarded annually to a Canadian composer under the age of 35.In 2014, the Canadian Opera Company produced a double-bill of Vivier's two one-act operas, Kopernikus and Musik für das Ende, to great critical acclaim. The production was hailed as a "musical revelation" and "a tremendous homage to a unique composer."Vivier's contributions to the world of contemporary classical music are immeasurable, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of composers and performers. Though his life was cut tragically short, his artistic vision and unique voice have left an indelible mark on the history of music.</p><p>Vivier's death was a shocking and tragic event that still remains somewhat of a mystery. At the time of his murder, he had been living in a small apartment in Paris, where he had invited a man he had met at a bar to come stay with him. The man, who has never been identified and was known only as "The Phantom Killer," later claimed that Vivier had made sexual advances towards him and that he had killed Vivier in self-defense. The truth behind the killer's motives and the circumstances surrounding the murder may never be fully known.</p><p>Despite the tragic nature of his death, Vivier's life and work continue to resonate with audiences around the world. His innovative compositions, use of unusual instrumentation, and exploration of spirituality and sexuality have cemented his place as one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century. Today, his music remains as fresh and vibrant as it did when he first introduced it to the world over three decades ago, serving as a testament to the enduring power of his creative vision.</p><p></p><p>
