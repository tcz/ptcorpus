(July 12, 1852		Buenos Aires-July 3, 1933			Buenos Aires)

	
		also known as Hipolito Yrigoyen

	
was
an Argentine
politician, teacher, farmer, lawyer and police commissioner.


					</p><p>He was the first president of Argentina elected by popular vote and served two non-consecutive terms: 1916-1922 and 1928-1930. Yrigoyen was a champion of democracy and fought against authoritarianism and corruption in Argentine politics. During his presidency, he implemented important social reforms, such as establishing a minimum wage and an eight-hour work day. He also supported women's suffrage, which was granted in 1947, after his death. Yrigoyen was known for his austere lifestyle, and was a frugal and honest politician who earned the respect and admiration of many Argentines. However, his second presidency was cut short by a military coup led by General Jose Felix Uriburu, who accused him of being too old and weak to govern. Yrigoyen died three years later, at the age of 80, and was buried with honors in Buenos Aires. His legacy remains an important part of Argentine history, and he is considered one of the most influential political leaders of his time.</p><p>Yrigoyen's political career began in 1889, when he was elected to the Buenos Aires City Council. He later served as a national deputy and senator, and helped found the Radical Civic Union (UCR) in 1891. Yrigoyen's popularity grew steadily over the years, and he was seen as a symbol of hope for the working classes and the urban poor. His first presidency was marked by economic growth and social progress, but also by political tensions and conflicts with the military and the conservative elites.</p><p>Yrigoyen's second presidency was marked by economic crisis and social unrest, as well as by accusations of corruption and authoritarianism. Some historians argue that he became increasingly isolated and out of touch with the people during his second term, and that he failed to address the underlying problems of the Argentine society, such as inequality, poverty and political polarization. However, Yrigoyen's supporters claim that he was the victim of a conspiracy by the conservative forces, who wanted to regain control of the government and reverse the reforms of the Radical period.</p><p>After his death, Yrigoyen became a mythic figure in Argentine politics, and his image was used by various political parties and movements to legitimize their claims of representing the people's will. Yrigoyen's legacy also inspired other Latin American leaders, such as Getulio Vargas in Brazil and Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States, who implemented similar programs of social reform and democratic inclusion. Today, Yrigoyen is remembered as a pioneer of Argentine democracy and as a beacon of hope for social justice and political participation.</p><p>Yrigoyen was born into a wealthy family and received a good education in Buenos Aires, which included studying law at the University of Buenos Aires. However, he developed sympathy for the poor and marginalized, and became involved in social and political activism at an early age. He worked as a teacher and farmer in the countryside, where he saw firsthand the exploitation and poverty suffered by the rural workers. Later, he served as a police commissioner in Buenos Aires, where he tried to improve the living conditions and security of the city's residents.</p><p>Yrigoyen was a strong advocate of the rule of law and civil liberties, and fought against the arbitrary powers of the state and the church. He also championed the cause of workers' rights and social welfare, and believed that the government had a responsibility to ensure economic and social justice for all citizens. In this sense, he was a precursor of the modern welfare state, and believed that social harmony and economic prosperity required a fair distribution of resources and opportunities.</p><p>Yrigoyen's political platform was based on four pillars: political democracy, economic liberalism, social justice, and national sovereignty. He believed that these principles were interdependent and complementary, and that only by promoting them together could Argentina become a modern and prosperous nation. Yrigoyen's advocacy of women's suffrage was part of his broader vision of equal rights and opportunities for all citizens, regardless of gender, race or class.</p><p>Yrigoyen's personal life was marked by tragedy and personal sacrifice. He lost his wife and daughter in a tragic accident in 1898, which left him devastated and emotionally scarred. He never remarried or had children, and devoted his life to public service and political activism. Yrigoyen's austere lifestyle and humble demeanor earned him the respect and affection of the Argentine people, who saw him as a model of integrity and simplicity.</p><p>Yrigoyen's legacy continues to influence Argentine politics and society, and his name is often invoked by politicians and activists of different ideological stripes. Although his ideas and policies have been criticized and debated over the years, his commitment to democracy, social justice, and national sovereignty remains an important source of inspiration for those who seek to build a more inclusive and equitable society in Argentina and beyond.</p><p>During his presidency, Yrigoyen also implemented important cultural policies, such as supporting the arts and promoting education. He founded the National Council of Education and created educational programs for rural areas and indigenous communities, which had been neglected by the previous governments. He also supported the preservation of Argentina's cultural heritage, and established museums and libraries to showcase the country's history and traditions. Yrigoyen was a firm believer in the power of culture to unite and inspire diverse communities, and saw it as an essential component of national identity and pride.</p><p>In addition to his domestic policies, Yrigoyen also pursued a balanced foreign policy, which sought to promote Argentine interests and influence in the region and the world. He established diplomatic relations with many countries, including the United States and the Soviet Union, and played a key role in the establishment of the League of Nations. Yrigoyen was a strong advocate of regional integration and solidarity, and believed that Latin American nations should work together to address common challenges and opportunities. He also opposed foreign intervention and imperialism, and championed the sovereignty and independence of all nations.</p><p>Yrigoyen's political philosophy was rooted in the principles of liberalism and progressivism, and he believed that democracy and social reform were inseparable. He saw politics as a tool for social change and empowerment, and believed that the government had a duty to protect the rights and interests of the people. Yrigoyen's legacy remains a source of inspiration and debate in Argentine politics and society, and his ideas continue to shape the country's vision of itself and its place in the world.</p><p></p><p>
