							During his career, Yılmaz Güney created a number of critically acclaimed films that tackled topics like social justice, poverty, and government corruption. He was also known for his groundbreaking portrayal of working-class individuals, and was a prominent figure in the wave of cinema that emerged in Turkey during the 1960s and 1970s, known as the "New Turkish Cinema". However, his political activism and outspokenness frequently brought him into conflict with the Turkish government, and he was imprisoned multiple times throughout his life. In fact, he famously wrote his novel "The Ugly King" while serving a prison sentence. In 1981, he managed to escape to France with the help of his wife, where he continued to work on films until his death from lung cancer in 1984. Despite the challenges he faced, Yılmaz Güney is still remembered by many as a pioneering figure in Turkish cinema who helped to bring important social and political issues to the forefront of public consciousness.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=1377091" title="Wikipedia article about Yılmaz Güney">Yılmaz Güney on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/british-actresses-died-in-adrenal-cancer.html' title='British actresses died in Adrenal cancer'><strong>British actresses died in Adrenal cancer</strong> List of the top 1 British actresses who died in Adrenal cancer</a></li><li><a href='/russian-actresses-died-in-1969.html' title='Russian actresses died in 1969'><strong>Russian actresses died in 1969</strong> List of the top 1 Russian actresses who died in 1969</a></li><li><a href='/pakistani-musicians-died-at-age-42.html' title='Pakistani musicians died at age 42'><strong>Pakistani musicians died at age 42</strong> List of the top 7 Pakistani music stars who died when they were 42</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swedish-actors-died-in-cerebral-hemorrhage.html' title='Swedish actors died in Cerebral hemorrhage'><strong>Swedish actors died in Cerebral hemorrhage</strong> List of the top 1 Swedish actors who died in Cerebral hemorrhage</a></li><li><a href='/cuban-actors-died-in-1963.html' title='Cuban actors died in 1963'><strong>Cuban actors died in 1963</strong> List of the top 1 Cuban actors who died in 1963</a></li><li><a href='/mexican-actresses-died-at-age-43.html' title='Mexican actresses died at age 43'><strong>Mexican actresses died at age 43</strong> List of the top 1 Mexican actresses who died when they were 43</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
