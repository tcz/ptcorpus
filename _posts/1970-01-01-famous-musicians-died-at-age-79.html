(May 30, 1814		Bruges-February 14, 1894			Liège)

	
		a.k.a. Eugene Charles Catalan

	
was
a Belgian
scientist and mathematician.


					</p><p>Catalan is best known for his work in number theory, particularly in the field of Diophantine equations. He is credited with formulating the Catalan conjecture, which states that 8 and 9 are the only consecutive perfect powers. This conjecture was proven to be true in 2002 by British mathematician Preda Mihăilescu. </p><p>In addition to mathematics, Catalan was also interested in linguistics and wrote several books on the subject. He was fluent in several languages, including French, Dutch, German, English, and Russian. Throughout his career, Catalan held academic positions in both Belgium and France and was a member of several scientific societies, including the Royal Society of Sciences and Arts of Belgium and the London Mathematical Society. </p><p>Catalan's legacy continues to be felt in the world of mathematics, as many of his ideas and discoveries remain influential to this day. The Catalan numbers, a sequence of integers that appear in various combinatorial problems, were named in his honor. Additionally, his work in Diophantine equations has led to important developments in algebraic number theory and other branches of mathematics.</p><p>Catalan was born in Bruges, Belgium, in 1814. His father was a French soldier who had settled in Belgium after the Napoleonic Wars. Catalan showed an early aptitude for mathematics and was largely self-taught in the subject. He went on to study engineering at the University of Liège and later became a professor of mathematics at the same institution. Catalan also worked as a mining engineer and was involved in the development of Belgium's coal industry.</p><p>Catalan's contributions to mathematics were broad and significant, ranging from the theory of polygonal numbers to the study of Bernoulli numbers. He was particularly interested in the properties of prime numbers and spent much of his career exploring their behavior. In addition to mathematics and linguistics, Catalan also had a keen interest in music and played the piano.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Catalan struggled financially for much of his life. He was never able to secure a permanent teaching position and often had to rely on grants and stipends to support himself. In 1864, he was awarded the Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques by the Académie des Sciences in Paris, but the prize money was not enough to alleviate his financial difficulties.</p><p>Catalan remained active in mathematics until his death in 1894. His contributions to the field helped lay the foundation for modern number theory and his work continues to inspire mathematicians to this day.</p><p></p><p>
