Hess's law states that the enthalpy change of a chemical reaction is independent of the pathway taken between the initial and final states. This principle is now widely used in chemical thermodynamics. Hess also made important contributions to the study of organic chemistry, including the discovery of the compound sulfovanillin. In addition to his scientific work, Hess was also an active proponent of liberal political ideals and was involved in the 1848 revolutions in Europe.</p><p></p><p>
