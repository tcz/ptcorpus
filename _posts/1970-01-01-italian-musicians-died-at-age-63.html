was
an Italian
personality.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Jean Alphonse Turretin.

						</p><p>Francis Turretin was a Protestant theologian who is best known for his extensive work "Institutes of Elenctic Theology." He was born into a family of Protestant refugees who had fled from Italy to Geneva, and it was in this city where he was educated and began his career in theology. Turretin was a prominent figure in the Reformed tradition, and through his work, he helped to establish the theological framework of Reformed Protestantism. He served as a professor of theology at the Academy of Geneva for over 30 years, and his lectures were known for their erudition and rigor. Turretin's work was influential in shaping the thought of subsequent generations of theologians, and his ideas continue to be discussed and debated within Reformed circles today.</p><p>His "Institutes of Elenctic Theology" is a seminal work that covers the entire spectrum of Christian theology, from the nature of God and the Trinity to the sacraments and eschatology. It is renowned for its rigorous logic and logical structure. In it, Turretin set out a comprehensive defense of the Reformed doctrine of predestination, which states that God has chosen from eternity those whom he will save and whom he will damn. While controversial in some quarters, this doctrine has been central to Reformed theology for centuries.</p><p>Turretin was deeply involved in the theological controversies of his day, and he played an important role in the debates over the nature of the Lord's Supper and the relationship between God's sovereignty and human free will. He was also a prolific writer of theological tracts, and his writings were widely read throughout Europe and the United States.

(April 5, 1581		Genoa-August 2, 1644			Venice)


was
an Italian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a prominent painter of the Baroque period and was often referred to as il prete genovese, meaning "the Genoese priest". </p><p>Strozzi's artistic career began in Rome, where he was initially trained in the workshop of Federico Barocci. It was here that Strozzi was exposed to the emerging style of Caravaggio, which had a profound impact on his own artistic style. </p><p>In the early 17th century, Strozzi returned to his hometown of Genoa, where he painted some of his most celebrated works, including several altarpieces and a series of portraits. Strozzi's unique style was characterized by his use of strong contrasts of light and shade, dramatic compositions, and his ability to capture the emotional intensity of his subjects.</p><p>After spending several years in Genoa, Strozzi moved to Venice in 1631, where he continued to paint until his death in 1644. Strozzi's legacy is still felt today, and his works can be found in museums and collections around the world.</p><p>Strozzi's life was not without controversy, however, as he was known for his rebellious spirit and his involvement in several scandals throughout his career. He was twice expelled from the painter's guild in Genoa, once for illicit relations with a noblewoman and once for stabbing a fellow artist in a dispute over a commission. Despite these setbacks, Strozzi remained a popular artist and was highly esteemed by his contemporaries, including the poet Giambattista Marino, who wrote a tribute to him in 1632. Today, Strozzi is considered one of the most important members of the Caravaggisti movement, which sought to emulate Caravaggio's style in their own works. His innovative use of light and shadow, combined with his skill at capturing the inner lives of his subjects, has ensured his lasting influence on the world of art.</p><p></p><p>
