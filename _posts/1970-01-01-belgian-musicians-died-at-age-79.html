									</h1><p>Here are 25 famous musicians from Belgium died at 79:</p><h2>Franz Cumont</h2><p><strong>Franz Cumont</strong>
(January 3, 1868		Aalst-August 20, 1947			Woluwe-Saint-Pierre)


was
a Belgian
scientist and archaeologist.


					</p><p>He focused his research on the religions of the ancient Near East, particularly the Mithraic mysteries of the Roman Empire. Cumont's most famous work was "The Mysteries of Mithra," which became a classic text in the field of religious studies. He also made important contributions to the study of astrology, publishing several works on the subject, including "Astrology and Religion Among the Greeks and Romans." In addition to his scholarly work, Cumont also served as the director of the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels. His legacy continues to influence the study of ancient religions and astrology to this day.</p><p>Cumont was born in Aalst, Belgium, and received his education in Ghent and Liège. He earned his doctorate in philology and history from the University of Ghent in 1889. After completing his degree, Cumont traveled extensively throughout Europe and the Middle East, where he conducted research on the roots of various belief systems. His travels enabled him to develop a unique perspective on the historical and cultural context of these religions. Cumont was a prolific writer and his works were translated into several languages, making him a leading authority on ancient religion and astrology. Aside from his scholarly work, Cumont was also active in politics, and he served in the Belgian Senate from 1932 to 1936. Despite his accomplishments, Cumont's legacy was somewhat overshadowed by the rise of new archaeological and historical methods in the decades following his death. Nevertheless, his contributions continue to be studied and discussed by scholars in the field.</p><p>Cumont's research on the Mithraic mysteries of the Roman Empire led him to conclude that these ancient beliefs were likely influenced by the practices of the Persian god Mithra. He also discovered a number of important Mithraic monuments and artifacts during his travels, which he brought back to Belgium for further study. In addition to his extensive research on religion, Cumont was also interested in the history of science, particularly the role of astrology in ancient societies. His work on this subject helped to shed light on the ways in which ancient people understood the cosmos and their place within it. Despite the challenges he faced during his career, including the destruction of many historical sites during World War I, Cumont remained dedicated to his work and continued to publish influential texts until his death in 1947. Today, he is widely regarded as one of the most important scholars in the field of ancient religion and his work continues to inspire new research and discoveries.</p><p></p><p>

(May 30, 1814		Bruges-February 14, 1894			Liège)

	
		a.k.a. Eugene Charles Catalan

	
was
a Belgian
scientist and mathematician.


					</p><p>Catalan is best known for his work in number theory, particularly in the field of Diophantine equations. He is credited with formulating the Catalan conjecture, which states that 8 and 9 are the only consecutive perfect powers. This conjecture was proven to be true in 2002 by British mathematician Preda Mihăilescu. </p><p>In addition to mathematics, Catalan was also interested in linguistics and wrote several books on the subject. He was fluent in several languages, including French, Dutch, German, English, and Russian. Throughout his career, Catalan held academic positions in both Belgium and France and was a member of several scientific societies, including the Royal Society of Sciences and Arts of Belgium and the London Mathematical Society. </p><p>Catalan's legacy continues to be felt in the world of mathematics, as many of his ideas and discoveries remain influential to this day. The Catalan numbers, a sequence of integers that appear in various combinatorial problems, were named in his honor. Additionally, his work in Diophantine equations has led to important developments in algebraic number theory and other branches of mathematics.</p><p>Catalan was born in Bruges, Belgium, in 1814. His father was a French soldier who had settled in Belgium after the Napoleonic Wars. Catalan showed an early aptitude for mathematics and was largely self-taught in the subject. He went on to study engineering at the University of Liège and later became a professor of mathematics at the same institution. Catalan also worked as a mining engineer and was involved in the development of Belgium's coal industry.</p><p>Catalan's contributions to mathematics were broad and significant, ranging from the theory of polygonal numbers to the study of Bernoulli numbers. He was particularly interested in the properties of prime numbers and spent much of his career exploring their behavior. In addition to mathematics and linguistics, Catalan also had a keen interest in music and played the piano.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Catalan struggled financially for much of his life. He was never able to secure a permanent teaching position and often had to rely on grants and stipends to support himself. In 1864, he was awarded the Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques by the Académie des Sciences in Paris, but the prize money was not enough to alleviate his financial difficulties.</p><p>Catalan remained active in mathematics until his death in 1894. His contributions to the field helped lay the foundation for modern number theory and his work continues to inspire mathematicians to this day.</p><p>In addition to his work in number theory and linguistics, Catalan also made contributions to geometry and algebraic geometry. He studied the properties of polyhedra and investigated the relationship between Diophantine equations and algebraic curves. Catalan also wrote on the topic of magic squares, a type of square grid filled with numbers, in which the sums of the numbers in each row, column and diagonal are the same. </p><p>Catalan was highly respected as a mathematician during his lifetime and was awarded numerous honors for his work. In addition to the Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques, he was also a member of the Academies of Science in Brussels, Paris, Rome and St. Petersburg. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Cambridge, Göttingen, and St. Andrews.</p><p>Catalan's personal life was marked by tragedy. He lost three children to an outbreak of cholera in 1866, and his wife died of cancer in 1873. Despite these hardships, Catalan remained dedicated to his work and continued to publish papers and solve mathematical problems until his death at the age of 79.</p><p></p><p>
