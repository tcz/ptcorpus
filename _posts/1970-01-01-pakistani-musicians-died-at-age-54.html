		also known as بھٹو بينظير, First lady Benazir Bhutto or Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto

	
was
a Pakistani
politician.


					
			
		She had
		three
		children,
		Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Bakhtawar Bhutto Zardari and Asifa Bhutto Zardari.

						</p><p>Bhutto was the first woman to be elected as the Prime Minister of Pakistan, serving two non-consecutive terms from 1988-1990 and then from 1993-1996. She was a prominent advocate for women's rights and democracy in Pakistan, working to advance the cause of democracy despite being persecuted and imprisoned by military dictatorships. Bhutto was also known for her strong stance against Islamic extremism, and faced numerous assassination attempts throughout her career as a result. She was assassinated in a suicide attack while campaigning for the 2008 Pakistani general election. The attack shocked the world and led to widespread protests and violence in Pakistan. Her death is mourned to this day, and she remains an iconic figure in Pakistani politics.</p><p>In addition to her political career, Bhutto was also a prolific author, publishing several books including her autobiography "Daughter of the East". She was educated at Harvard University and the University of Oxford, where she studied politics, philosophy, and economics. Bhutto came from a politically active family, with her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto also serving as Prime Minister of Pakistan before being overthrown in a military coup. Despite facing opposition and criticism for the legacy of her family's political history, Bhutto remained a strong and inspirational leader for many in Pakistan and around the world. Her legacy continues to inspire and influence politics in Pakistan, particularly in the realm of women's empowerment and democracy.</p><p>Benazir Bhutto's family had a long and complicated history in Pakistani politics. Her grandfather had helped found the All-India Muslim League, while her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had served as president and prime minister of Pakistan, before he was overthrown in a 1977 military coup. In 1984, Benazir's brother Shahnawaz was also found dead under mysterious circumstances in France, which some believe was an assassination in retaliation for their family's political activities.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Bhutto remained determined to fight for democracy and women's rights in Pakistan. She founded the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in 1967, while still a student at Oxford, and later became its chairperson following her father's death in 1979. Her rise to power was not without its challenges, however. She was removed from office in 1990 by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan on charges of corruption, and was again dismissed in 1996, this time by President Farooq Leghari.</p><p>Bhutto spent much of her career in and out of exile, facing accusations of corruption and other crimes. She returned to Pakistan in 2007, after President Pervez Musharraf granted her amnesty on the corruption charges, and began campaigning for the upcoming general election. However, her life was cut short when she was assassinated in a suicide attack in Rawalpindi on December 27, 2007, while campaigning for the PPP. The identity of the attackers remains unknown, and there is still debate in Pakistan about who was responsible for Bhutto's death.</p><p>In addition to her political achievements, Bhutto was also known for her love of the arts and literature. She was an accomplished poet, and her works were published in several collections. She was also fluent in several languages, including English, Urdu, and French. Her legacy continues to inspire people around the world, and Pakistanis maintain a deep respect and admiration for her contributions to their country.</p><p></p><p>
						She died caused by assassination.
