						</p><p>Gorky was born in the Ottoman Empire and his family immigrated to the United States in 1920 to escape the Armenian Genocide. He studied art in Boston and eventually moved to New York City where he became a prominent member of the Abstract Expressionist movement. Gorky's work was influenced by his Armenian heritage, as well as European modernism, particularly the work of Surrealist artists. He created abstracted forms and shapes that were often biomorphic and organic in nature, exploring themes of identity, memory, and trauma. Despite struggling with personal tragedies such as a studio fire that destroyed much of his work and a battle with cancer, Gorky continued to create art until his death by hanging at the age of 44. His work has had a lasting impact on the modern art world and has been celebrated for its emotional depth, symbolism, and innovation.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of suicide.
