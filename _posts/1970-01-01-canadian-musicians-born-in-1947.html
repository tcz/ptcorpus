In the 1950s and 1960s, he worked with a number of prominent architectural firms and also maintained his own practice.

He served as the chair of the Department of Architecture at Yale and was later appointed dean of the School of Architecture. He also taught at a number of other universities and was widely admired for his ability to inspire and challenge his students.</p><p>Despite his numerous achievements, Paul Rudolph's reputation suffered in the years following his death. Many of his buildings were demolished or fell into disrepair, and his style fell out of favor as architects moved towards more austere and minimalist approaches. However, in recent years, there has been a renewed interest in Rudolph's work, and many of his buildings have been restored or reevaluated for their architectural significance.</p><p></p><p>
