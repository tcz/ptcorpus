Munch was also known for his prints and drawings, and his work has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world.</p><p>In addition to his artistic contributions, Munch was also an important figure in the modernist art movement and influenced many other artists of his time. He continued to create art until his death in 1944 at the age of 80.</p><p>Munch's work was often criticized during his lifetime for being too emotionally charged and controversial.
