(November 27, 1903		Oslo-October 5, 1976			Coral Gables)


was
a Norwegian
physicist, engineer and chemist.


					</p><p>He is most well-known for his work in the field of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. Onsager made significant contributions to the development of the theory of phase transitions, especially in the study of the Ising model. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1968 for his contributions to the field of thermodynamics. Onsager also made important contributions to the study of electrolyte solutions and the behavior of polymers. He earned his undergraduate degree from the Norwegian Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. from Yale University. Onsager worked at several universities, including Duke University and Yale University, before joining the faculty at the University of Miami in 1952. He remained there until his death in 1976.</p><p>Onsager was born in Norway and grew up in a family of prominent scientists and engineers. His father was a chemical engineer and his mother was a mathematician. Onsager showed an early aptitude for mathematics and science, and after completing his undergraduate degree, he began to focus on theoretical physics. During his time at Yale, Onsager worked closely with the physicist J. Willard Gibbs, who had made significant contributions to the field of thermodynamics. Onsager's work in the area of phase transitions and critical phenomena helped to bridge the gap between the theoretical models proposed by Gibbs and their experimental observations. </p><p>In addition to his contributions to science, Onsager was known for his love of music and literature. He was fluent in several languages and was an accomplished pianist. Onsager was also an active member of the Quakers, and his religious beliefs were a major influence on his work and life. He was married and had three children. </p><p>Onsager's legacy in the field of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics is significant. His work on the Ising model, which describes the behavior of magnetized materials, remains an important area of study in physics. Onsager's statistical mechanics approach to understanding the properties of materials has also been applied to other fields, including economics and social science. Onsager's contributions to science were recognized with numerous awards and honors, including the National Medal of Science in 1976. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important physicists of the 20th century.</p><p>Onsager's work on electrolyte solutions was also groundbreaking. He developed a mathematical model to describe the behavior of ions in a solution, which is now known as the Onsager equation. This model is still widely used in the study of electrochemistry and has applications in fields such as materials science and biochemistry. Onsager was a highly respected physicist and his work had a profound impact on the scientific community. He was a member of several scientific organizations, including the National Academy of Sciences and the American Physical Society. Onsager's contributions to science were not limited to his research, he also served as an editor for several scientific journals and wrote many influential papers and books. Onsager was a dedicated teacher and mentor and his influence can still be felt in the work of many modern physicists.</p><p></p><p>
