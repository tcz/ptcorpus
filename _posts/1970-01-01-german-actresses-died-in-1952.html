							Wolle began her acting career in Berlin in 1913 and appeared in over 70 films throughout her career. She was known for her roles in silent films, including "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" (1920) and "Varieté" (1925), as well as her work in sound films, such as "Der Mann, der Sherlock Holmes war" (1937). She was also a successful stage actor, known for her performances in plays by Bertolt Brecht and other prominent German playwrights. Despite her success, Wolle faced significant challenges during World War II, as her Jewish heritage made her a target of persecution by the Nazi regime. She was ultimately forced to flee Germany in 1938 and lived in Switzerland and the United States before returning to Munich in 1950. Wolle died two years later at the age of 61.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=28839256" title="Wikipedia article about Gertrud Wolle">Gertrud Wolle on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/polish-actresses-died-in-1992.html' title='Polish actresses died in 1992'><strong>Polish actresses died in 1992</strong> List of the top 2 Polish actresses who died in 1992</a></li><li><a href='/english-actresses-died-in-2000.html' title='English actresses died in 2000'><strong>English actresses died in 2000</strong> List of the top 7 English actresses who died in 2000</a></li><li><a href='/czechoslovakian-actresses-died-in-1970.html' title='Czechoslovakian actresses died in 1970'><strong>Czechoslovakian actresses died in 1970</strong> List of the top 1 Czechoslovakian actresses who died in 1970</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/english-musicians-died-in-cardiovascular-disease.html' title='English musicians died in Cardiovascular disease'><strong>English musicians died in Cardiovascular disease</strong> List of the top 3 English music stars who died in Cardiovascular disease</a></li><li><a href='/malaysian-actresses-died-in-2014.html' title='Malaysian actresses died in 2014'><strong>Malaysian actresses died in 2014</strong> List of the top 1 Malaysian actresses who died in 2014</a></li><li><a href='/jamaican-musicians-died-in-brain-tumor.html' title='Jamaican musicians died in Brain tumor'><strong>Jamaican musicians died in Brain tumor</strong> List of the top 1 Jamaican music stars who died in Brain tumor</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
