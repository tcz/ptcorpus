He was a leading figure in the Nagybánya artists' colony, which was instrumental in developing the Hungarian plein-air painting style. Hollósy was also a professor at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts, where he influenced a generation of Hungarian artists. His work often featured rural Hungarian life, and he was known for his use of vivid colors and expressive brushstrokes. Despite his success, Hóllósy struggled with alcoholism and died in poverty.</p><p></p><p>

(August 23, 1908		Kislovodsk-March 15, 1970			Paris)


was
an Armenian
playwright.


					</p><p>Arthur Adamov often associated with the avant-garde movement was known for his absurdist plays and his groundbreaking techniques in theater. Born to an Armenian family in Russia, he had to flee to France during the Russian Revolution. He studied philosophy in Paris, where he also became a part of the thriving literary scene of the time. Adamov's works often dealt with the themes of identity, isolation, and self-destruction. He was a member of the theater of the absurd alongside other notable playwrights such as Samuel Beckett and Eugene Ionesco. Among his most famous works are "Ping Pong," "The Physicists," and "The Invasion," which explored the dehumanizing effects of technology and modernization. While Adamov's works received critical acclaim in his lifetime, he experienced personal troubles, including addiction to drugs, that led to his tragic death at the age of 61. However, his contributions to the world of theater have left a lasting impact on the form and inspired generations of writers and creative practitioners.</p><p></p><p>
