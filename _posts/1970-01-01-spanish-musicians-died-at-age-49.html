(June 9, 1887		Placetas-June 3, 1937			Alcocero de Mola)


was
a Spanish
personality.


					</p><p>Mola was a general in the Spanish Republican Army during the Spanish Civil War. He later joined the Nationalist faction and became one of General Franco's most trusted commanders. Mola was known for his aggressive tactics and was the mastermind behind the Nationalist uprising in 1936 that sparked the Spanish Civil War. His death in a plane crash in 1937, just months before the end of the war, was a serious blow to the Nationalist cause. Mola is remembered as one of the most important figures in Spanish military history.</p><p>Mola was born into a military family and began his career as a cadet at the Toledo Infantry Academy. He participated in the Rif War in Morocco and was later appointed as the military governor of Pamplona. During the early days of the Spanish Civil War, Mola was appointed as the military governor of Navarre and used his position to organize the Nationalist forces in the region.</p><p>Under Mola's leadership, the Nationalist forces employed brutal tactics, including the execution of Republican sympathizers and the bombing of civilian targets. Despite this, Mola was considered a brilliant military strategist and was credited with several key victories during the war. He was also responsible for the creation of the Nationalist Fifth Column, a network of sympathizers who worked behind Republican lines to sabotage their war effort.</p><p>Mola's death in a plane crash was a major setback for the Nationalist cause. It is speculated that his plane was sabotaged by Republican agents, although this was never proven. Franco later declared Mola a national hero and his death was used as a rallying cry for Nationalist forces during the final months of the war. Today, Mola is remembered as a controversial figure, praised for his military prowess but criticized for his brutal tactics and role in sparking the Spanish Civil War.</p><p>Mola was also known for his political views, as he was a staunch conservative and fervent supporter of the nationalist cause. He viewed the Republican government as a threat to Spanish unity, and saw the Nationalist uprising as a necessary step to protect the country from communism and anarchism. Mola's reputation as a strong leader and devout Catholic also endeared him to many supporters of the Nationalist cause.</p><p>Despite his military accomplishments, Mola's legacy is not without controversy. His use of brutal tactics and the involvement of the Nationalist Fifth Column in the war contributed to a climate of violence and fear across Spain. Mola's death also remains shrouded in mystery, with some historians questioning whether it was truly an accident or if he was targeted by political enemies.</p><p>Overall, Emilio Mola's life and career illustrate the complex political and social factors that led to the Spanish Civil War, as well as the devastating impact of the conflict on Spain and its people. While his tactics and beliefs may be controversial, Mola remains an important figure in Spanish history and his legacy continues to resonate in the country today.</p><p>Mola's influence on the Nationalist cause was not limited to his military tactics alone. He also played a key role in shaping the political ideology of the movement, advocating for a return to traditional Spanish values and a rejection of liberal democracy. Mola was a vocal opponent of communism, anarchism, and other leftist movements, which he believed were a threat to Spanish identity and culture. </p><p>In addition to his military and political activities, Mola was also a prolific writer, producing several books and articles on military strategy and Spanish history. His memoirs, published posthumously, provide valuable insights into the thinking and actions of Nationalist commanders during the Spanish Civil War. </p><p>Although Mola's legacy remains controversial, his contributions to Spanish history cannot be ignored. His military tactics, political ideology, and literary works all played a significant role in the development of modern Spain. Today, Mola is remembered both as a hero to some and a villain to others, but his impact on the country and its people continue to be felt.</p><p></p><p>
