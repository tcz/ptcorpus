(January 31, 1914		Newark-February 2, 1981			Red Bank)

	
		otherwise known as Mayor Hugh Joseph Addonizio

	
was
an Italian
politician.


					</p><p>He served as the 33rd Mayor of Newark, New Jersey from 1962 to 1970. Addonizio was known for his efforts to revitalize the city during his time as mayor, though his administration was also marred by charges of corruption. He was later indicted and found guilty on charges of conspiracy and extortion related to his time in office, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Addonizio died in 1981 at the age of 67. Despite the scandal surrounding his later years, he remains an important figure in the history of Newark and of Italian-American politicians in the United States.</p><p>During his time as mayor, Addonizio implemented several initiatives aimed at revitalizing Newark, including the construction of new buildings and development of public spaces such as parks and plazas. However, his administration was also marked by allegations of bribery, extortion, and other forms of corruption. In 1967, Newark experienced a period of civil unrest known as the Newark riots, in which 26 people were killed and over 700 were injured. Some critics have suggested that Addonizio's policies may have contributed to the underlying tensions that led to the riots. </p><p>After his conviction and imprisonment, Addonizio's reputation suffered greatly, and his name became synonymous with political corruption in Newark. However, supporters have pointed out that he was not the only Newark politician to be implicated in corruption scandals, and that his contributions to the city should not be overlooked. Today, Addonizio's legacy remains a subject of debate, with some viewing him as a symbol of the challenges facing urban areas in the mid-20th century, and others seeing him as a reminder of the importance of holding public officials accountable for their actions.</p><p>Addonizio grew up in Newark and attended local schools, including Seton Hall University. After working as an insurance salesman, he began his political career as a member of the Newark City Council, where he served for several years before being elected mayor.</p><p>In addition to his efforts to revitalize Newark, Addonizio was also known for his support of civil rights and for his advocacy on behalf of Italian-Americans. During his tenure as mayor, he appointed several African-American officials to positions of power in the city government and supported the desegregation of schools in Newark.</p><p>Despite his efforts to improve the city, Addonizio's legacy has been overshadowed by the corruption charges that arose during his time in office. In addition to his own conviction, several of his colleagues and associates were also found guilty of various crimes, and the scandals that rocked Newark during the 1960s and 70s tarnished the city's reputation for years to come.</p><p>Overall, Addonizio's story is a complex one that speaks to the challenges and complexities of urban politics in the mid-20th century. Though his reputation has been sullied by the scandals that marked his later years, his contributions to Newark and his efforts to address the pressing issues facing the city should not be forgotten.</p><p></p><p>
