(May 6, 1879		Lysá nad Labem-December 12, 1952			Prague)

	
		otherwise known as Bedrich Hrozny

	
was
a Czechoslovakian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a linguist and professor of ancient Near Eastern studies at Charles University in Prague. Hrozný was known for deciphering the ancient Hittite language, which had been a mystery for decades. His breakthrough came in 1915, when he published a paper demonstrating that Hittite was an Indo-European language. This discovery revolutionized the field of linguistics and helped establish the study of ancient Anatolian languages. Hrozný also made contributions to the study of Sumerian and Assyrian languages. In addition to his linguistic work, he was involved in politics and served in the Czechoslovakian parliament. Hrozný died in Prague in 1952, leaving behind a legacy as one of the foremost scholars of ancient languages.</p><p>Hrozný was born into a family of Czech teachers and grew up bilingual in Czech and German. He attained his education from Charles University in Prague, where he also later taught, and from the University of Berlin, Germany. During World War I, Hrozný worked as a war correspondent for several Czech and German newspapers. He was awarded the Legion of Honour, the highest decoration in France, for his work during the war. In 1933, Hrozný was appointed the director of the Oriental Institute at the University of Prague, where he continued to teach and conduct research until his retirement in 1949. Despite being a renowned scholar, Hrozný remained modest and dedicated to his work throughout his career. His contributions to the world of linguistics have had enduring significance and continue to inspire scholars today.</p><p>Hrozný's work on the Hittite language was groundbreaking, as it helped to reveal the relationships between different ancient cultures and their languages. His findings were also used to identify and translate other ancient languages, including the Luwian language, which he played a significant role in deciphering. Hrozný's work deeply impacted the way linguistics was approached, as he advocated for the comparative method, which involves comparing languages to identify similarities and differences.</p><p>Apart from his contributions to linguistics, Hrozný was a respected public figure in his home country. He was actively involved in politics and social issues, advocating for the rights of ethnic minorities and promoting cultural exchange between different communities. Hrozný was also passionate about archaeology and led numerous expeditions to excavate ancient sites in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq.</p><p>Despite facing adversity throughout his life, including anti-Semitic persecution during World War II, Hrozný persevered and continued his work, leaving behind a rich legacy of academic research and public service. He was known not only for his intellectual accomplishments but for his humility and kindness, making him a beloved figure in both academic and public spheres.</p><p></p><p>
