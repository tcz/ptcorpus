							Violet Hopson was born in Port Augusta, South Australia, and began her acting career in her hometown's amateur theatrical productions. She then moved to London, where she initially worked as a governess before landing her first professional acting job. Hopson went on to star in numerous British silent films, including "For the Term of His Natural Life" (1927) and "The First Born" (1928), and was dubbed the "Queen of the British Screen" by the press. She retired from acting in the early 1930s and went on to live a private life in Kensington, London, where she passed away in 1973 at the age of 85. Despite her immense talent as an actor, Hopson remains relatively unknown today, and her contributions to the early film industry are often overlooked.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=31827694" title="Wikipedia article about Violet Hopson">Violet Hopson on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-2000.html' title='Famous actors died in 2000'><strong>Famous actors died in 2000</strong> List of the top 50 Famous actors who died in 2000</a></li><li><a href='/american-actresses-in-caracas.html' title='American actresses in Caracas'><strong>American actresses in Caracas</strong> List of the top 5 American actresses who live in or lived in Caracas</a></li><li><a href='/british-actors-died-in-1997.html' title='British actors died in 1997'><strong>British actors died in 1997</strong> List of the top 24 British actors who died in 1997</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/canadian-actresses-died-in-reckless-driving.html' title='Canadian actresses died in Reckless driving'><strong>Canadian actresses died in Reckless driving</strong> List of the top 1 Canadian actresses who died in Reckless driving</a></li><li><a href='/hongkongese-actresses-died-in-brain-cancer.html' title='Hongkongese actresses died in Brain Cancer'><strong>Hongkongese actresses died in Brain Cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Hongkongese actresses who died in Brain Cancer</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actresses-died-in-1969.html' title='Indian actresses died in 1969'><strong>Indian actresses died in 1969</strong> List of the top 2 Indian actresses who died in 1969</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
