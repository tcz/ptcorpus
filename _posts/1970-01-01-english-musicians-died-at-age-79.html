was
an English
singer.


					</p><p>He was considered one of the greatest tenors of the nineteenth century, known for his pure and powerful voice, as well as his dramatic performances. Reeves made his professional debut at the age of 19 and quickly became a star, performing in concerts and operas throughout Europe and America. He was particularly known for his interpretations of songs by composers such as Rossini, Verdi, and Mozart. Reeves was also celebrated for his philanthropy, often performing benefit concerts for various charities. He was honored with many awards during his career, including a knighthood in 1888. Despite retiring from public performance in 1891, Reeves continued to teach and write about singing techniques until his death in 1900.</p><p>Reeves was born in Shooter's Hill, London as the son of a musician. His natural talent was spotted early on, and he began his formal music training at the age of 14. His first major break came in 1846 when he was invited to sing on tour with the legendary Italian soprano Giulia Grisi. The tour was a great success, and Reeves earned critical acclaim for his performances.</p><p>Throughout the 1850s and 1860s, Reeves continued to tour Europe and America, performing in operas and concerts. His popularity soared, and he became one of the highest-paid performers in the world. He was widely regarded as the preeminent tenor of his time and was often compared to his contemporary, the great Italian tenor Enrico Caruso.</p><p>In addition to his singing career, Reeves was a passionate advocate for music education. In 1873, he established the Reeves Vocal School in London, which trained hundreds of aspiring singers throughout its years of operation. He also wrote several instructional books on singing technique, including the widely read "The Art of Singing." </p><p>Reeves's life was not without tragedy, however. His wife died young, and he struggled with alcoholism for many years. He eventually retired from public performance in 1891 due to health concerns but continued to work as a teacher and writer until his death in 1900.

He frequently performed benefit concerts for working-class charities and was an early member of the Royal Society of Musicians, an organization that provided financial assistance to musicians in need. In 1870, he helped to organize a charity concert for the families of workers killed in the Franco-Prussian War.</p><p>Despite his dedication to his craft, Reeves was known for his modesty and kindness. He was a popular figure among his colleagues and was often sought out for advice on singing technique. Reeves was also an avid collector of art and antiquities, and his collection was sold at auction following his death.</p><p>Reeves's legacy lived on after his death, with several of his pupils going on to become successful singers in their own right.

(June 13, 1884		Blundellsands-February 12, 1964			Tunis)

	
		also known as Gerald Brousseau Gardner, Scire or Gerald Brosseau Gardner

	
was
an English
writer and novelist.


					</p><p>He was also the founder of the modern Wiccan movement, which he popularized in his books "Witchcraft Today" and "The Meaning of Witchcraft". Gardner was born into an affluent family and traveled extensively throughout his life, spending time in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. He had a keen interest in the occult and was initiated into several esoteric organizations, which influenced his development of Wicca. Gardner's brand of Wicca, known as Gardnerian Wicca, emphasizes the worship of a dual deity, the Horned God and the Goddess, and places great importance on the practice of magic and ritual. Despite some controversy surrounding his claims and practices, Gardner's influence on contemporary paganism and the acceptance of Wicca as a legitimate religious movement cannot be overstated.</p><p>Gardner's involvement in the occult and esoteric practices began in the 1930s when he was introduced to the New Forest coven, a group of individuals who practiced witchcraft in secret. He became a member of the coven and was eventually initiated into their practices. In the 1940s, Gardner began to develop his own form of witchcraft, which he called the "Craft of the Witches".</p><p>In addition to his involvement in Wicca, Gardner was also active in the naturist and nudist movements, and he wrote several books on the subject. He was a member of the English Folk Dance and Song Society and was interested in preserving traditional songs and dances. Gardner was also an accomplished amateur archaeologist, and he conducted excavations at several sites in Great Britain.</p><p>Despite his large influence on modern Wicca, Gardner himself remains something of an enigma. Some scholars have called into question his claims about the origins of Wicca, and others have suggested that he may have fabricated some aspects of his life story. Nevertheless, his contributions to the development of modern pagan religions are widely recognized, and he is revered by many in the Wiccan and broader pagan community.</p><p>Gardner was known for his eccentric personality and colorful life. He was a man of many interests, and aside from his involvement in the occult and esoteric practices, he also enjoyed deep-sea fishing, beekeeping, and bee venom therapy, which he believed had healing properties. Gardner lived in various places throughout his life, including Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Malaysia, Borneo, and Gibraltar, where he worked as a customs officer. He retired from his job in 1936 and returned to England, where he devoted himself full-time to his esoteric pursuits.</p><p>During World War II, Gardner served as an air raid warden and continued to practice witchcraft in secret. After the war, he became more open about his beliefs and worked to promote Wicca as a legitimate spiritual path. He founded several covens and initiated numerous individuals into the Craft of the Witches.</p><p>Gardner's legacy continues to inspire and influence modern paganism, witchcraft, and neopagan religions. His books on Wicca, which were published in the 1950s and 60s, are still in print today and have been translated into numerous languages. Gardner's writings and teachings have sparked a revival of interest in traditional witchcraft, and his ideas have inspired countless practitioners of the Craft around the world.</p><p></p><p>

an English
politician and theologian.


					
			
		He had
		six
		children,
		Mary Williams, Mercy Williams, Providence Williams, Joseph Williams, Daniel Williams and Freeborn Williams.

						</p><p>Williams is perhaps best known for his role in founding the colony of Rhode Island and advocating for religious freedom and separation of church and state. In 1635, he was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony due to his beliefs, and went on to purchase land from the Narragansett tribe and establish the settlement of Providence. He also founded the first Baptist church in America, and was a champion for the rights of Native Americans. Additionally, Williams wrote several influential works on politics and religion, including "The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution" and "The Key into the Language of America".</p><p>After founding the colony of Rhode Island, Williams continued to be an important figure in colonial politics. He served as the colony's president and even traveled to England to obtain a charter for the colony. Despite opposition from other colonies and the English government, Rhode Island remained a haven for religious minorities and a beacon of religious freedom. Williams also played a key role in negotiating treaties with Native American tribes in the region, earning their respect and trust. His writings and philosophy of religious tolerance and individual liberty had a profound impact on the development of American political thought and the formation of the United States Constitution. Today, Williams is remembered as a pioneering advocate for freedom of conscience and one of the most important figures in American history.</p><p>In addition to his political and theological accomplishments, Roger Williams was also a linguist and scholar. He learned several Native American languages, including Narragansett, and used his knowledge to translate the Bible and other documents into these languages. He also translated pamphlets from English into the language of the Narragansett people, helping to facilitate communication and understanding between the Native American tribes and the colonists.</p><p>Williams' commitment to religious liberty extended to his views on gender equality. He believed that women should be allowed to participate equally in religious and political life, a radical idea for his time. Williams' wife Mary also played an active role in the founding and administration of Providence and the Rhode Island colony.</p><p>Despite being banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Williams maintained friendships with many of its prominent figures, including John Winthrop and Thomas Dudley. He also corresponded with leading intellectuals of his day, such as John Milton and Roger Boyle.</p><p>Williams' legacy continues to be celebrated in Rhode Island, where he is honored with a statue and a national memorial. His influence can also be seen in the modern-day concept of the separation of church and state, a principle that he championed over three hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>

(May 10, 1900		Wendover-December 7, 1979			Cambridge)


was
an English
astronomer.


					</p><p>She was the first woman to be appointed as a full-time professor at Harvard College Observatory. Payne-Gaposchkin was best known for her groundbreaking work in the field of astrophysics, particularly her discovery of the chemical composition of stars. In 1925, she developed the theory that stars were made up primarily of hydrogen and helium, rather than the previously believed theory that stars were made up of the same materials as the Earth. Her discovery revolutionized the field of astrophysics and cemented her as one of the most important figures in the history of astronomy. Payne-Gaposchkin was also a prominent advocate for women in academia and worked tirelessly to improve the opportunities available to women in science.</p><p>She was born in Wendover, England, and showed an early interest in science. Payne-Gaposchkin enrolled at the University of Cambridge in 1919 but was not awarded a degree because at that time Cambridge did not grant degrees to women. She then moved to the United States to attend Radcliffe College and eventually earned a Ph.D. in astronomy from Harvard in 1925. Payne-Gaposchkin was initially hired as a technical assistant at Harvard College Observatory but quickly rose through the ranks to become a professor in 1956.</p><p>In addition to her scientific accomplishments, Payne-Gaposchkin was a humanist and a devoted teacher. She wrote several popular science books, including "The Dyer's Hand," which describes her life and work in astrophysics. Her dedication to scientific inquiry and the advancement of women in science inspired generations of astronomers to come. Today, she is remembered as a pioneering figure in the study of stars and a trailblazer for women in academia.</p><p>Furthermore, Payne-Gaposchkin received many accolades throughout her career. In 1934, she became the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in astronomy from Radcliffe College. She also received numerous awards, including the Henry Norris Russell Prize from the American Astronomical Society in 1976, and the Trailblazer Award from the National Women's History Project in 1994. Payne-Gaposchkin was also the first woman to be elected as an officer of the American Astronomical Society.</p><p>Payne-Gaposchkin's contributions to astronomy continue to be studied and honored today. In 2018, the International Astronomical Union named a crater on the planet Mercury in her honor. Additionally, in 2020, Google paid tribute to her with a Google Doodle on what would have been her 117th birthday.</p><p>Despite facing discrimination as a woman in a male-dominated field, Payne-Gaposchkin's contributions to astronomy and her advocacy for women in science serve as a reminder of the importance of diversity and inclusion in STEM fields.</p><p></p><p>

(February 22, 1924		Bath-April 17, 2003			Wallingford, Oxfordshire)


was
an English
psychologist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on reasoning and the development of the Wason selection task, which is widely used to study logical reasoning in psychology. As a young man, Wason served in the British Army during World War II, where he became interested in psychology. After the war, he studied philosophy and psychology at University College London, where he earned his PhD. Wason spent most of his academic career at University of Edinburgh, where he was a professor of psychology. He published numerous articles and books on topics such as reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Wason was also known for his unconventional approach to teaching, often using humor and real-life examples to engage his students.</p><p>In addition to his work on reasoning, Wason also made important contributions to the study of problem-solving and decision-making behavior. He is particularly well known for his research on the confirmation bias, which refers to the tendency for people to seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs and to ignore information that contradicts them. Wason's work on this topic helped to shed light on the ways in which people process information and make decisions.</p><p>Outside of his academic work, Wason had a strong interest in music and was an accomplished pianist. He also enjoyed gardening and birdwatching. Wason was married with two children and lived in Oxfordshire until his death in 2003. Today, he is remembered as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century, and his work continues to be studied and applied in a wide range of fields, including cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction.</p><p>Wason's development of the Wason selection task was a groundbreaking contribution to the field of cognitive psychology. The task presents participants with a set of four cards, each with a different shape on one side and a number on the other. Participants are asked to determine which cards they would need to turn over to test a particular rule, such as "If a card has an even number on one side, then its opposite side is a vowel." Through his research, Wason found that people consistently struggled with this task, often making incorrect choices that reflected a failure to consider all relevant information. This led Wason to explore the underlying mechanisms of reasoning and decision-making, in order to better understand how people arrive at their conclusions.</p><p>Throughout his career, Wason worked to develop a more comprehensive understanding of human cognition and behavior. He was known for his willingness to challenge prevailing ideas and to explore new avenues of research. His work on the confirmation bias, for example, challenged the traditional view of scientific inquiry as a process of hypothesis testing, suggesting that people often prefer to gather evidence that supports their existing beliefs rather than pursuing truly objective investigation. This insight has had important implications for fields such as political science, economics, and sociology.</p><p>Wason's contributions to psychology and cognitive science were recognized with many honors and awards over the course of his career. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1981 and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1978. He was also the recipient of the American Psychological Association's prestigious William James Award in 1991. Despite his many achievements, Wason remained humble and committed to his work, earning the respect and admiration of colleagues and students alike.</p><p></p><p>
