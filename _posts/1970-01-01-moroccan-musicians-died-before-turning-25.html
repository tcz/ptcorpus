He was particularly interested in Surrealism and its relationship to the Moroccan artistic tradition. His paintings and drawings were often exhibited alongside his literary works.</p><p>Towards the end of his life, Khaïr-Eddine returned to his birthplace of Tafraout, where he built a home and lived with his family.
