		also known as Arthur Eric Rowton Gill

	
was
a British
graphic designer.


					</p><p>In addition to graphic design, Eric Gill was also a sculptor, engraver, typographer, and writer. He is known for his typographic designs for book covers, such as his work on the Golden Cockerel Press editions, as well as his typeface designs, including Gill Sans and Perpetua. Gill's work was often controversial due to his personal life, which included allegations of sexual abuse and incest. Despite this, his work remains influential in the field of graphic design, and his typefaces are still widely used today. Gill's most famous public sculpture is probably the Prospero and Ariel in Broadcasting House, London.</p><p>Eric Gill was born in Brighton, England, into a family of nonconformist ministers. He studied at the Chichester Technical and Art School and later at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. After his studies, Gill moved to Ditchling, where he set up a workshop that became an important center for the Arts and Crafts movement. </p><p>Gill's early work was strongly influenced by the movement, but he later developed a more modernist style, particularly in his typography. His most significant commission as a sculptor was the Stations of the Cross for Westminster Cathedral. </p><p>Gill wrote extensively on art, design, and his philosophy of life. His most famous work, "An Essay on Typography," is still considered a classic of design writing. </p><p>In addition to his design work, Gill was also an active member of the Catholic Church and a proponent of distributism, an economic theory that emphasizes the importance of local production and small-scale ownership.</p><p>Today, Gill's legacy is recognized through his influence on modern typography and his reputation as a major figure of twentieth-century design. However, his controversial personal life has also prompted a rethinking of his work and contribution to the field.</p><p></p><p>

was
a British
politician.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Thomas Grenville and William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville.

						</p><p>George Grenville served as the Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1763 to 1765. He was known for his role in implementing the Stamp Act, which was a tax on printed materials in the American colonies. This act was met with significant resistance from the colonists and helped fuel the tensions that led to the American Revolution. Grenville also worked to improve the British navy and reduce government spending. He was a controversial figure during his time and faced significant opposition from other politicians. After his time as Prime Minister, Grenville continued to be active in politics until his death in 1770.</p><p>Grenville was born into a political family and received his education at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He was first elected to Parliament in 1741 and quickly became known for his fiscal conservatism and strong support of the British navy. In 1754, he was appointed treasurer of the navy and later became the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1761.</p><p>During his tenure as Prime Minister, Grenville's government passed several controversial measures, including the aforementioned Stamp Act and the Currency Act, which restricted the use of paper money in the colonies. These measures were aimed at reducing the British national debt and increasing revenue, but they ultimately proved to be counterproductive as they contributed to the growing animosity between the colonies and the British government.</p><p>Grenville was known as a hardworking and principled politician but was also considered to be uncompromising and inflexible. His rigid adherence to his policies and reluctance to form coalitions with other political factions contributed to his downfall as Prime Minister.</p><p>Despite his political setbacks, Grenville continued to be an influential figure in British politics and was instrumental in the formation of the Rockingham Whig group, which opposed the policies of his successor, Lord North. He died in 1770 after collapsing in the House of Lords while delivering a speech.</p><p></p><p>

(June 8, 1729		Norbury Park-January 27, 1788			London)


was
a British
personality.


					</p><p>He served as the Governor of the Province of North Carolina from 1765 to 1771, and later as Governor of the Province of New York from 1771 to 1774. Prior to his governorship, Tryon led a successful military career, serving in various capacities during the Seven Years' War. He is perhaps best known for his role in suppressing the Regulator Movement in North Carolina, which was a rebellion by farmers against corrupt officials in the colonial government. During his time in New York, Tryon was involved in the controversy surrounding the New York Stamp Act, which was among the events leading up to the American Revolution. After his time as Governor, Tryon returned to England, where he continued his military career and was eventually promoted to the rank of general.</p><p>Tryon was born into a wealthy family and received a strict education in England, where he studied law at the Inner Temple. However, his passion for military service led him to join the British Army, and he quickly rose through the ranks due to his abilities as a commander and strategic thinker. In addition to his military achievements, Tryon was also an accomplished artist and architect, with a particular interest in designing and building grand homes.</p><p>Despite his successes, Tryon's governorships were marred by controversy and opposition from colonists who felt that he was abusing his power or neglecting their needs. His efforts to exert control over American colonies and suppress rebellions ultimately contributed to the escalation of tensions between Great Britain and the colonies, which eventually led to the American Revolution. Nonetheless, Tryon remained loyal to the British crown and continued to serve in the military until his retirement.</p><p>Today, Tryon's legacy is mixed, with some historians viewing him as a capable leader who was dedicated to his duties, while others see him as a symbol of British oppression and colonial control. His impact on American history, however, cannot be denied, as he played a significant role in the events leading up to the American Revolution and the eventual creation of the United States.</p><p></p><p>
