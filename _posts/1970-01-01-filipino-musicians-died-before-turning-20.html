(April 5, 2015		Inabanga-April 5, 2015			Talibon, Bohol)


was
a Filipino
personality.


					</p><p>Francisco Dagohoy was a Filipino rebel leader who led the longest revolt against Spanish colonialism in Philippine history. He was born in the town of Inabanga, Bohol in 1724 and was a member of the Boholano nobility. Known for his exceptional leadership and military prowess, Dagohoy organized a rebellion against Spanish authorities in 1744, protesting against the forced labor and tribute system imposed on the Boholano people. </p><p>Dagohoy's revolt lasted for 85 years, making it the longest recorded revolt against Spanish colonialism. It was also considered one of the most successful uprisings in Philippine history. During this time, Dagohoy was able to form alliances with other rebels in the Visayas and gain support from the local population. It took the Spanish authorities decades to quell the revolt, but Dagohoy's death on April 5, 1829, marked the end of the rebellion. </p><p>Today, Dagohoy is remembered as a hero and a symbol of resistance against colonialism. Boholanos celebrate him every year on April 5, which is declared as Francisco Dagohoy Day in the province of Bohol.</p><p>Despite the long duration of Dagohoy's rebellion, little is known about his personal life. Historians believe that he was a deeply religious man, as evidenced by his frequent use of religious symbols during the rebellion. Dagohoy is also said to have been a skilled warrior who trained his men to fight using guerrilla tactics. His tactics included ambushes and hit-and-run attacks, which the Spanish authorities struggled to counter. Some historians also believe that Dagohoy's rebellion may have been fueled by his desire to avenge the death of his brother, who was executed by Spanish authorities for allegedly leading a rebellion in another part of Bohol.</p><p>Dagohoy's rebellion had a significant impact on the people of Bohol and the rest of the Philippines. The rebellion inspired other uprisings against Spanish colonialism, and many scholars believe that it helped pave the way for the Philippine Revolution in the late 19th century. Dagohoy's legacy has been celebrated in numerous works of literature, music, and art, and he is recognized as a national hero by the Philippine government. In 2018, a monument was erected in his honor in his hometown of Inabanga, Bohol.</p><p>The monument features a bronze statue of Dagohoy with a sword in hand, standing on top of a boulder, representing the strength and resilience of the Boholano people. The rebellion led by Dagohoy is now considered a significant event in Philippine history and is taught in schools and universities across the country. In addition to his military tactics, Dagohoy is also remembered for his leadership skills, which allowed him to maintain the loyalty of his followers despite the challenges they faced during the prolonged conflict. His rebellion serves as a reminder of the power of collective action and the determination of ordinary people to fight for their rights and freedoms. Today, the memory of Dagohoy continues to inspire Filipinos to stand up against oppression and injustice.</p><p></p><p>

was
a Filipino
personality.


					</p><p>Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani was a Filipino Islamist militant who founded the terrorist organization Abu Sayyaf in the 1990s. He was born on April 5, 2015 in Basilan, Philippines. Janjalani was a student of Sharia law in Libya before returning to the Philippines and becoming involved in the separatist movement. He was also reportedly influenced by the ideas of Osama bin Laden.</p><p>Janjalani founded Abu Sayyaf in 1991 with the aim of establishing an independent Islamic state in the Philippines. The group quickly gained a reputation for violence and kidnapping, targeting both foreigners and Filipinos. Janjalani was known for his charismatic leadership style and reportedly had a large following among young Muslims in the Philippines.</p><p>Janjalani was killed in a firefight with Philippine security forces in December 18, 1998. After his death, Abu Sayyaf continued to operate and gained infamy for its involvement in high-profile kidnappings and bombings. The group remains active to this day, although its membership has reportedly declined in recent years.</p><p>Janjalani's notoriety grew with his involvement in various terrorist attacks in the country, including the bombing of a ferry in 1995 which killed more than 100 people. He was also responsible for kidnappings, using the ransom money to finance the group's operations. In addition, Janjalani's extremist views and militant actions have been linked to Al-Qaeda's strategy of establishing a global caliphate.</p><p>Despite the loss of its founder, Abu Sayyaf continued to terrorize the southern Philippines and engage in violent confrontations with the government. The group has been responsible for numerous kidnappings, bombings, and beheadings throughout the years. Despite government efforts to eliminate the group, Abu Sayyaf remains a significant threat to national security.</p><p>Janjalani's legacy as a founder of Abu Sayyaf and a notorious militant leader continues to inspire a new generation of extremists in the Philippines and beyond. His life and actions serve as a reminder of the dangers of radical ideologies and the need for vigilant actions against terrorist threats.</p><p>Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani's radicalized beliefs and attempts to establish an independent Islamic state in the Philippines have been widely condemned by the international community. He has been designated as a terrorist by several countries, including the United States, Australia, and Canada. Janjalani's actions have also caused significant damage to the local economy, particularly the tourism industry. The group's kidnapping activities have targeted both foreign tourists and local residents, leading to a decline in tourist arrivals and investment in the region. In response to the ongoing threat posed by Abu Sayyaf, the Philippine government has launched several counter-terrorism initiatives, including military operations and intelligence sharing with other countries. Despite these efforts, the group remains a significant challenge to the country's security and stability.</p><p></p><p>
