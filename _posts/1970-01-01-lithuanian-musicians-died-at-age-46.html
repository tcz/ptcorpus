(July 15, 1609		Vilnius-January 19, 1656)


was
a Lithuanian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a nobleman, politician and military commander, recognized for his bravery and leadership in battles against Swedish, Russian and Ukrainian forces. Sapieha was also known for his scholarly pursuits and patronage of the arts, with a vast collection of books, manuscripts, and artworks. He was educated at the Universities of Vilnius, Padua and Pisa, and was fluent in several languages, including Latin, Italian, and French. Sapieha served as the Grand Hetman of Lithuania, the highest military and political position in the Commonwealth, from 1646 until his death. He played a pivotal role in the defense of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Deluge, a devastating period of invasion and occupation by neighboring powers. Sapieha is regarded as one of the greatest military leaders in Lithuanian history, and his legacy is celebrated to this day.</p><p>Sapieha came from one of the most prominent noble families in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Sapieha family. His military achievements included the successful defense of the fortress at Smolensk against Russian forces in 1633 and leading a decisive victory over a much larger Swedish army at the Battle of Kiejdany in 1651. He was also instrumental in negotiating the Treaty of Kardis with Russia in 1661, which brought an end to the Thirteen Years' War.</p><p>In addition to his military prowess, Sapieha was a devoted patron of the arts and sciences. He commissioned the building of several magnificent palaces and churches, including the Holy Trinity Church in Vilnius, and collected rare books and manuscripts that formed the basis of the Sapieha Library in Vilnius. Sapieha was also a prolific writer, and his works on military strategy and tactics were widely read and respected throughout Europe.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Sapieha's life was not without controversy. He was implicated in a conspiracy against the King of Poland in 1655 and was briefly imprisoned before being released and allowed to resume his duties as Grand Hetman. He died the following year, aged just 46, but his legacy lived on, and he was remembered as one of the most celebrated Renaissance figures of his time.</p><p></p><p>
