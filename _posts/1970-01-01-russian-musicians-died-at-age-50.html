(May 18, 1868		Tsarskoye Selo-July 17, 1918			Yekaterinburg)

	
		otherwise known as Nikolay Alexandrovich Romanov, Bloody Nicholas, Nicholas II, Czar Nicholas II, Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarevich Nicholas II, Nikolay II, Tsar Nikolaj II, Nicky, Nicholas the Short, Nikolai II, Nikolai Alexandrovich Romanov or Nicolas II

	
was
a Russian
politician.


					
			
		He had
		five
		children,
		Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia, Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia, Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia and Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia.

						</p><p>Nicholas II was the last Emperor of Russia, ruling from 1894 until his forced abdication in 1917 during the Russian Revolution. He inherited the throne from his father, Alexander III, and continued his conservative policies, despite social unrest and demands for reform. During his reign, Russia experienced a number of crises, including the Russo-Japanese War and Bloody Sunday, which marked the beginning of the 1905 Revolution. Despite making some reforms, Nicholas II's autocratic governing style was deeply unpopular with the Russian people, and he was ultimately overthrown by the Bolsheviks. After his abdication, he and his family were placed under house arrest, and in 1918, they were executed by the Bolsheviks, becoming known as the "Romanovs' execution". Nicholas II was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000 as a saint and passion bearer.</p><p>Nicholas II was born in Tsarskoye Selo, a town near Saint Petersburg, Russia. He was the eldest son of Alexander III and his wife, Empress Maria Feodorovna. As a child, Nicholas was privately tutored and later attended military school. He married Princess Alexandra of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1894, with whom he had five children.</p><p>Nicholas II was deeply religious and saw his role as emperor as being divinely appointed. He believed in the absolute power of the monarchy and resisted calls for democratic reform. Despite this, he did make some attempts at modernizing Russia, such as promoting industrial development and improving railways.</p><p>Nicholas II's reign was marked by political upheaval and social unrest. The Russo-Japanese War was a major military disaster, and the resulting economic strain led to widespread protests and strikes. In 1905, the Bloody Sunday massacre sparked a revolution that forced Nicholas to make some concessions, such as establishing an elected legislative assembly, the Duma. However, he retained ultimate control and the Duma had little power.</p><p>During World War I, Nicholas II took personal command of the Russian army, but the war effort was plagued by poor leadership and supply shortages. Meanwhile, food shortages and inflation caused widespread suffering and fueled discontent.</p><p>In February 1917, a popular uprising forced Nicholas to abdicate. The Provisional Government took over, but it was weak and ineffective. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, seized power in October and established a communist government. Nicholas II and his family were taken into custody and, in July 1918, they were executed by the Bolsheviks.</p><p>Although Nicholas II was widely criticized during his lifetime, particularly for his autocracy and resistance to reform, his tragic end and the subsequent collapse of the Romanov dynasty have contributed to his aura of martyrdom. He is still a controversial figure in Russian history, with some viewing him as a victim of circumstances beyond his control, and others seeing him as a symbol of oppressive royal rule.</p><p>Nicholas II was also known for his close relationship with faith healer Grigori Rasputin, who was believed to have gained significant influence over the royal family. Many blamed Rasputin for the country's problems, and he was eventually assassinated in 1916. </p><p>After his death, Nicholas II and his family were declared saints by the Russian Orthodox Church, and their remains were eventually buried in St. Petersburg. In 1991, their bodies were exhumed and officially identified through DNA testing. </p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Nicholas II is still remembered as a significant figure in Russian history, and his reign continues to be studied by historians and scholars. His tragic death and the events leading up to it remain a topic of fascination for many.</p><p>During his reign, Nicholas II faced numerous challenges, including widespread poverty and an outdated feudal economic system. He believed in the traditional autocratic system of government, which often led to clashes with progressive forces in Russia that were pushing for modernization and reform. Nicholas II was also criticized for the lavish lifestyle of the royal family, which was seen as out of touch with the struggles of the common people.</p><p>Another significant event during Nicholas II's reign was the Russian Orthodox Church's persecution of other religions and minority groups. Nicholas II was a devout Orthodox Christian, and he supported the church's attempts to suppress the activities of non-Orthodox Christians, Jews, and Muslims. This policy contributed to the rise of anti-Semitic sentiment in Russia, which eventually led to pogroms and violent attacks on Jewish communities.</p><p>Despite his conservative policies, Nicholas II was an avid supporter of the arts and culture in Russia. He was a patron of the ballet and personally funded the construction of the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. He also commissioned the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway, which connected European Russia to the far east of the country and helped to promote economic development in the region.</p><p>Overall, Nicholas II's reign was marked by political and social upheaval, economic struggles, and a slow decline of the once-mighty Russian Empire. Despite his efforts to maintain the status quo, the forces of change were too strong for him to resist, and his reign ultimately came to an end in the bloody chaos of the Russian Revolution.</p><p>After his death, Nicholas II's legacy continued to be debated and contested. In Soviet Russia, he was vilified as a symbol of aristocratic oppression, and his family's execution was celebrated as a victory for the working class. However, in recent years, a growing number of Russians have come to see him as a tragic figure who was caught up in larger forces that were beyond his control.</p><p>In 1998, President Boris Yeltsin formally apologized for the execution of Nicholas II and his family, and in 2000, the Russian Orthodox Church canonized them as saints and passion bearers. Their memory is now honored with many monuments and memorials throughout the country.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Nicholas II remains a popular subject of study for historians, biographers, and filmmakers. Numerous books, films, and documentaries have been produced that explore his life, reign, and legacy, and many continue to debate whether he was a victim of circumstances or a flawed ruler who played a role in his own downfall.</p><p></p><p>
