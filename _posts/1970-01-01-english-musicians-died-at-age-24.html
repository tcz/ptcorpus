(April 5, 1787		London-December 8, 1811			Richmond)

	
		also known as Elizabeth Arnold Poe or Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe

	
was
an English
theater actress and actor.


					
			
		Her children
		are
		called
		Edgar Allan Poe, William Henry Leonard Poe and Rosalie Mackenzie Poe.

						</p><p>Eliza Poe was born into a family of actors and was raised to follow in their footsteps. She traveled extensively throughout the United States and made her debut in Boston in 1806. She met and married David Poe Jr., also an actor, in 1806 and together they had three children. However, David Poe Jr. abandoned the family in 1810, leaving Eliza to raise their children on her own.</p><p>Eliza Poe struggled to support her family and eventually fell ill with tuberculosis. She died in December of 1811, leaving her children to be split up among different relatives. This event had a profound impact on her son Edgar Allan Poe, who would later become one of the most famous writers in American history. Poe would often mention his mother in his writings, describing her as his "angel mother" who watched over him from beyond. Despite her short life and struggles, Eliza Poe's legacy lives on through her famous son's work.</p><p>Eliza Poe's legacy also impacted the literary world as she inspired many of Edgar Allan Poe's famous works such as "The Raven" and "Annabel Lee". Her husband's abandonment and her struggle to provide for her family also influenced Poe's writing on the theme of loss, grief, and poverty. Eliza Poe's talent as an actress and her dedication to her children continue to be remembered and celebrated, and her story serves as a reminder of the struggles and sacrifices that many women faced during the 19th century. Today, she is often recognized as a key figure in shaping the life and work of her famous son, Edgar Allan Poe.</p><p></p><p>
						She died caused by tuberculosis.

was
an English
personality.


					</p><p>Alexander Obolensky, also known as Prince Alexander Sergeevich Obolensky, was a Russian-born English rugby union player. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wingers in English rugby history. His family fled Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution and settled in England, where Obolensky attended Cambridge University and played for the university rugby team. He went on to play for the Harlequins and the England national rugby union team. Obolenskyâ€™s most memorable moment was during the 1936 Calcutta Cup match between England and Scotland, where he scored two tries on his international debut, both of which were spectacular dives in the corner. He tragically died in a flying accident while serving as a pilot during World War II.</p><p>Obolensky's death at the young age of 24 cut short what could have been a remarkable rugby career. Despite only playing three games for the England national team, he had already cemented his place in rugby history with his memorable debut performance. The way he scored his two tries against Scotland has since been immortalized in the sport's folklore. </p><p>In addition to his rugby career, Obolensky was also a skilled pilot. He joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1937, and was trained as a pilot just before the outbreak of World War II. He initially flew reconnaissance missions, but was later assigned to a fighter squadron. Obolensky was flying a Hurricane fighter plane when he crashed near RAF Martlesham Heath in March 1940. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Andrews Church in Sutton, Suffolk with full military honors. </p><p>Despite his short life and career, Alexander Obolensky's legacy lives on. He continues to be remembered as one of the greatest talents that English rugby has ever produced, and his name is forever associated with the famous 1936 Calcutta Cup match. In 2012, a plaque was unveiled in his honor at Twickenham Stadium, the home of English rugby.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in aviation accident or incident.
