Eliza had a tumultuous personal life, with her marriage to David Poe Jr. (a lawyer and actor) being strained due to his alcoholism and early death from tuberculosis. After his death, Eliza struggled financially and was forced to place her children in the care of various foster families. Her son, Edgar Allan Poe, went on to become one of the most famous writers of his time, but tragically, he was also plagued by financial difficulties and personal demons. Eliza herself died at the age of 24 from tuberculosis, leaving behind her legacy as an accomplished actress and the mother of one of America's greatest literary figures.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=545995" title="Wikipedia article about Eliza Poe">Eliza Poe on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Judy Tyler</h2><p><strong>Judy Tyler</strong>
