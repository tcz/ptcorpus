personality.


					</p><p>However, he was known for his leadership in a religious cult known as the "Ant Hill Kids" that operated in Quebec during the 1970s and 1980s. Thériault's cult involved a number of criminal activities, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, and murder. He was eventually arrested and sentenced to life in prison in 1993 for the murder of one of his followers. Thériault died in prison in 2011 at the age of 63. His actions and the actions of his cult continue to be a subject of fascination and horror in Canadian popular culture.</p><p>Born in Saguenay, Quebec, Roch Thériault was raised in a Catholic family and attended a seminary for a short time before dropping out. He later became involved in the Seventh-day Adventist Church before starting his own religious group, the "Ant Hill Kids," in the 1970s. Thériault attracted followers with his charismatic personality and promises of a new, utopian society.</p><p>The cult operated on a farm in Burnt River, Ontario before moving to a remote location in Quebec in the early 1980s. Thériault enforced strict rules on his followers, including the separation of men and women, the rejection of medical treatment, and the use of physical and psychological abuse to maintain control over members. He also claimed to have supernatural powers and convinced his followers to harm themselves and others to prove their loyalty to him.</p><p>In 1989, one of Thériault's followers, Solange Boilard, died after he performed a crude castration on her without medical training or equipment. Thériault was eventually arrested and charged with murder, along with several other charges related to his treatment of followers. He was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in 1993.</p><p>Thériault's story has been the subject of several books and documentaries, including the 2019 film "The Antenna," which is based on his life and crimes. Despite the passing of time and Thériault's death, his legacy as a cult leader and abuser continues to horrify and captivate the public.</p><p>Thériault's life and crimes have been analyzed by psychologists and sociologists, who have called his behavior an extreme example of the dangers of cults and charismatic leaders. His cult's abuse and manipulation of its members have been compared to other high-profile cases, such as the Manson Family and the People's Temple. </p><p>Thériault's personal life was also marked by instability and dysfunction. He had multiple wives and mistresses, and his children were subjected to the same abusive environment as his followers. His attempts to cure his own mental health issues through self-mutilation and bizarre rituals have been seen as further evidence of his extreme behavior. </p><p>Despite the horrific nature of his crimes, Thériault continued to have loyal followers even after his imprisonment. Some former members of his cult continue to defend him, while others have spoken out publicly about the abuse they suffered. The legacy of Roch Thériault and the Ant Hill Kids serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of blind devotion and the power of charismatic leaders.</p><p></p><p>
