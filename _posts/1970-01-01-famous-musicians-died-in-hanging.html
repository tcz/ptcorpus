(March 17, 1969		Lewisham-February 11, 2010			Mayfair, London)

	
		a.k.a. Lee Alexander McQueen or Lee McQueen

	
was
a British
fashion designer, visual artist, designer, artist and couturier.


					</p><p>McQueen is known for his highly avant-garde and dramatic runway shows, often featuring controversial themes that challenged societal norms. He began his career as an apprentice on Savile Row and quickly rose to fame in the 1990s. McQueen was awarded the title of British Designer of the Year four times and was also appointed as the head designer of the French fashion house, Givenchy in 1996. In addition to his groundbreaking work on the runway, McQueen also designed costumes for films, including the 2011 blockbuster, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows." Despite being highly successful and revered in the fashion world, McQueen struggled with depression and tragically took his own life in 2010. His legacy lives on through the Alexander McQueen brand, which continues to push the boundaries of fashion and remains a highly respected and influential force in the industry.</p><p>McQueen grew up in London and left school at the age of 16 to pursue a career in fashion. He studied at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, where he earned his master's degree in fashion design. His graduate collection, "Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims," was purchased in its entirety by influential fashion stylist Isabella Blow, who became McQueen's mentor and championed his work. McQueen's designs were known for their dark, edgy and unconventional aesthetic, and he frequently incorporated elements of Gothic and punk rock subcultures into his collections.</p><p>In addition to his work as a fashion designer, McQueen was also a talented visual artist and designer. He created installations and sculptures, including a large-scale installation for the Tate Modern gallery in London, and designed furniture and home accessories. His collaborations with other designers and artists were also highly acclaimed, including his work with jeweler Shaun Leane and photographer Nick Knight. </p><p>McQueen's untimely death at the age of 40 shocked the fashion community and the world at large. His funeral was attended by many of his peers and admirers, who paid tribute to his creativity, artistry, and unique vision. In the years since his passing, the Alexander McQueen brand has continued to flourish, with designer Sarah Burton taking over as creative director and keeping McQueen's spirit and legacy alive through her own innovative designs.</p><p>McQueen's rise to fame in the 1990s was meteoric, as he quickly gained a reputation as one of the most talented and provocative designers of his generation. His runway shows were often controversial and always unforgettable, featuring theatrical elements such as models walking on water, robots spraying paint on dresses, and even a hologram of Kate Moss. McQueen was also known for his use of unconventional materials and techniques, such as his "bumster" trousers, which featured an ultra-low waistline that was considered scandalous at the time. Despite the controversy surrounding his work, or perhaps because of it, McQueen's designs were beloved by celebrities and fashion insiders alike, with clients including Lady Gaga, Rihanna, and Sarah Jessica Parker.</p><p>In addition to his innovative fashion designs, McQueen also made a name for himself as a costume designer for films and theater productions. He designed the wardrobe for David Bowie's 1996 "Earthling" tour, as well as costumes for the Royal Ballet and the English National Opera. McQueen's eye for drama and theatrics was a perfect match for the big screen, and he designed costumes for several noteworthy films, including "Björk: Volumen," "The Hunger Games," and most famously, "Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty," a documentary about his life and work.</p><p>McQueen's influence on the fashion industry cannot be overstated, as he continually pushed the boundaries of what was possible and acceptable in the world of fashion. His legacy continues to inspire designers around the world to take risks and challenge the status quo.</p><p>McQueen was also known for his deeply personal and emotional collections, which often reflected his own struggles with mental health and the pressures of the fashion industry. One such collection, "Highland Rape" (1995), sparked controversy for its graphic depictions of sexual violence, but also revealed McQueen's willingness to tackle difficult and taboo subjects in his work. He worked with iconic fashion photographer Nick Knight on many of his most memorable campaigns, often incorporating digital effects and surreal imagery to create a dreamlike and otherworldly atmosphere.</p><p>Despite his fame and success, McQueen remained a fiercely private individual, rarely giving interviews and carefully guarding his personal life from the public eye. His tragic death came just days before the start of his New York Fashion Week show, which had been highly anticipated by fans and critics alike. His passing was an immense loss to the fashion community, but his vision and spirit continue to be celebrated and honored through the continued success of the Alexander McQueen brand.</p><p></p><p>

(April 24, 1906		Brooklyn-January 3, 1946			HM Prison Wandsworth)

	
		a.k.a. Lord Haw Haw or Joyce, William

	
was
a British
politician.


					</p><p>Actually, William Joyce was not a British politician. He was an American-born fascist and Nazi propaganda broadcaster during World War II. Joyce was a member of the British Union of Fascists before fleeing to Germany when war broke out. He later became a naturalized German citizen and began broadcasting propaganda aimed at demoralizing British troops and citizens. His broadcasts earned him the nickname "Lord Haw Haw." Joyce was captured by British authorities in May 1945 and executed for treason in January 1946.</p><p>Joyce's broadcasts were infamous for their exaggerations and claims of British defeat, as well as his distinctive voice and British accent. He was also known for spreading anti-Semitic and xenophobic rhetoric. After his capture, Joyce was put on trial for treason, despite being an American citizen. His defense that he had never formally renounced his US citizenship was not accepted, and he was found guilty and executed. Joyce's legacy was one of betrayal and collaboration with the enemy, and his name became a byword for treason in the UK.</p><p>Joyce's story is particularly interesting because of his background - he was actually born in Brooklyn, New York to Irish Catholic parents. His family moved to Ireland when he was young, and he later attended college in England. It was there that he became involved in far-right politics, joining the British Union of Fascists and rising through its ranks. When war broke out, Joyce fled to Germany with the help of Nazi sympathizers and began broadcasting propaganda aimed at British listeners.</p><p>Despite his American citizenship, Joyce became one of the most notorious figures in the Nazi propaganda machine. He was known for his bombastic style and his willingness to make outrageous claims in his broadcasts. He also frequently used his British accent to try to convince listeners that he was someone with inside knowledge of the situation in Britain.</p><p>After the war, Joyce was captured by British forces and put on trial for treason. The trial was controversial, as some argued that Joyce's American citizenship should have protected him from prosecution. Nevertheless, he was found guilty and executed in January 1946. Today, Joyce is remembered as a cautionary tale about the dangers of collaboration with fascist regimes and the corrosive effects of propaganda.</p><p>It's worth noting that Joyce's propaganda broadcasts were not limited to just Britain. He also targeted the United States and other Allied powers, trying to deepen divisions and spread disinformation. Joyce's broadcasts were a key part of the Nazi propaganda machine, which sought to undermine morale and sow confusion among enemy forces. </p><p>Furthermore, there is some speculation that Joyce may have had Jewish ancestry on his mother's side. This irony was not lost on his detractors, who viewed his rabid anti-Semitism as a desperate attempt to distance himself from his possible Jewish heritage. </p><p>Joyce's life and career have been the subject of numerous books, movies, and other media. While he remains a controversial figure, his story continues to fascinate those interested in the history of fascism, propaganda, and the Second World War.</p><p></p><p>
