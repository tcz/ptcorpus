(November 14, 1899		La Chaux-de-Fonds-September 11, 1934			Geneva)


was
a Swiss
personality.


					</p><p>He was primarily known for his work as a painter and his contribution to the artistic movement called "Precisionism." Barraud’s paintings were characterized by their clean lines, geometric shapes, and bold use of color, which conveyed a sense of precision and clarity. He also dabbled in sculpture, ceramics and photography. Towards the end of his life, Barraud struggled with depression and eventually took his own life at the age of 34. Despite his relatively short career, Barraud's work has continued to be admired and studied by art lovers around the world.</p><p>Barraud came from a family of artists; both his father and three brothers were painters. He was home-schooled and began to show an interest in art at an early age. He trained at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Geneva and went on to study sculpture in Paris in the 1920s. Barraud exhibited his work in both Switzerland and France, and his paintings received critical acclaim from both sides of the border. His work was influenced by modernist movements such as Cubism, Futurism, and De Stijl. </p><p>Barraud, like many artists of his time, struggled to make a living from his art. To support himself, he worked as a photographer and designer for the advertising industry. Despite his financial difficulties, Barraud remained committed to his artistic vision and continued to produce bold, innovative paintings until the end of his life. </p><p>Today, Barraud's work can be found in major museums and private collections in Europe and North America. In 2012, the Musée Jenisch in Vevey, Switzerland, organized a major retrospective of Barraud’s work, which helped to further solidify his place in the canon of 20th-century art.</p><p>Barraud's paintings can be seen as a reflection of his personal life, often featuring domestic scenes and family members as his subjects. His style was characterized by a blend of modernism and classicism, which gave his work a unique and timeless quality. Barraud was also interested in the relationship between art and technology, and his paintings often incorporated elements of machines and industrial design. In addition to his work as a painter, Barraud was a prolific writer and art critic, contributing articles to various publications throughout his career. He was passionate about sharing his knowledge and promoting the work of other artists. Barraud was a complex and multi-talented individual whose legacy continues to inspire and captivate art enthusiasts around the world.</p><p>In his later years, Barraud became increasingly interested in the art of photography and its potential for artistic expression. He experimented with various techniques, including photograms and photomontages, and produced a series of striking images that blurred the line between photography and painting. Barraud's fascination with photography was also reflected in his work as a commercial photographer, where he often incorporated photographic elements into his designs for advertisements and posters.</p><p>Despite his success as an artist, Barraud struggled with personal demons throughout his life. He suffered from depression and alcoholism, and his relationships with family members and lovers were often fraught with tension and conflict. In 1934, at the age of 34, Barraud took his own life. His tragic death was a shock to the artistic community, and many mourned the loss of such a promising talent.</p><p>Today, Barraud's legacy lives on through his art and writings. His paintings are celebrated for their precision, clarity, and innovative use of color, and his photography and design work continue to inspire contemporary artists. Barraud's life and work are a testament to the power of artistic expression and the enduring importance of the visual arts in our society.</p><p></p><p>
