									</h1><p>Here are 19 famous musicians from France died at 59:</p><h2>Michel de Montaigne</h2><p><strong>Michel de Montaigne</strong>
(February 28, 1533		Château de Montaigne-September 13, 1592			Château de Montaigne)

	
		a.k.a. Michel Eyquem de Montaigne or Michel Montaigne

	
was
a French
philosopher and writer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his collection of essays, "Essais," which he began writing in 1572 and revised until his death. Montaigne saw the essay as a way of exploring himself and his thoughts, as well as the world around him. His essays cover a wide range of topics, including friendship, education, faith, and human nature.</p><p>Montaigne was born into a wealthy family and spent much of his life surrounded by the intellectual elite of his time. However, he also spent several years living as a recluse, retreating to his family's estate after a traumatic experience. This time spent alone allowed him to focus on his writing and introspection and ultimately resulted in his masterwork, "Essais."</p><p>Montaigne's approach to writing was groundbreaking at the time, as he focused on personal experience and observation rather than relying on the wisdom of the classical authors who had come before him. This approach helped pave the way for modern essayists and memoirists.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Montaigne was also involved in politics, serving as both mayor of Bordeaux and a member of the French parliament. However, he ultimately saw himself as a philosopher and writer above all else, and his legacy has endured through his influential essays.</p><p></p><p>
