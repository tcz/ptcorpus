was
a Georgian
personality.


					</p><p>He was one of the leaders of the paramilitary organization "Mkhedrioni" in the 1990s, which aimed to restore order and protect Georgian sovereignty during the tumultuous years of post-Soviet transition. Abashidze was a controversial figure, known for his confrontational tactics and alleged involvement in several violent incidents. </p><p>After the fall of the Soviet Union, Abashidze became involved in the military conflict in Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia, which was seeking independence. He led a paramilitary group in the region and fought against Abkhazian separatists. In September 1992, Abashidze was killed in a battle in Sukhumi, the capital of Abkhazia. </p><p>Despite his divisive legacy, Abashidze remains a prominent figure in Georgian history, remembered as a charismatic leader who fought for his country's independence and sovereignty during a time of great turmoil and uncertainty.</p><p>Abashidze's early years were marked by tragedy as his father, a well-known Georgian film director, was killed in a mysterious car accident when he was only 15 years old. Despite this setback, Abashidze went on to study law at Tbilisi State University and later became involved in politics during the perestroika era of the Soviet Union. He was one of the founders of Mkhedrioni, which was initially formed to fight against criminal organizations in Georgia, but later became embroiled in political and military conflicts. Abashidze was known for his fiery speeches and bold actions, but also for his close ties to Georgian business tycoons and politicians, which led to accusations of corruption and abuse of power. In addition to his involvement in the conflict in Abkhazia, Abashidze also played a role in the civil war in Georgia in the early 1990s. Despite his controversial legacy, Abashidze's name remains synonymous with the turbulent years of post-Soviet transition in Georgia, and his life and death continue to be celebrated and commemorated by some as a symbol of Georgian nationalism and patriotism.</p><p>Abashidze's death in the battle of Sukhumi was a major blow to the Mkhedrioni and to Georgia as a whole. His funeral was attended by thousands of people, including many high-ranking politicians and military leaders. Despite his controversial reputation, Abashidze was mourned by many as a hero who gave his life for his country.</p><p>After his death, Abashidze became a symbol of Georgian nationalism, and his legacy continues to be controversial. Some see him as a patriot and a hero who fought for Georgia's independence, while others criticize his tactics and his alleged involvement in corruption and criminal activities. Nevertheless, Abashidze's impact on Georgian history is undeniable, and his name remains a part of the country's political and cultural landscape.</p><p>Abashidze's legacy also includes his contributions to the development of the Georgian film industry. He produced several successful films, including the critically acclaimed movie "Keto and Kote" (1986), which was directed by his father. In addition to his work in film and politics, Abashidze was an avid sportsman and was known for his passion for wrestling. He was a three-time Georgian wrestling champion and represented Georgia in international competitions. Abashidze was also a patron of the arts and supported many Georgian artists and musicians.</p><p>Despite his controversial reputation, Abashidze left a lasting impact on Georgian society. He was a charismatic and influential leader who played a significant role in shaping Georgian politics and culture during a time of great upheaval and transformation. Even today, more than two decades after his death, Abashidze remains a powerful symbol of Georgian patriotism and nationalism, and his legacy continues to inspire and divide Georgians.</p><p>Abashidze's involvement in the conflict in Abkhazia was marked by controversy, as he was accused of using brutal tactics and targeting civilians. His paramilitary group was also accused of carrying out looting and other criminal activities. Despite these accusations, Abashidze remained a popular figure among many Georgians who supported his efforts to protect their country's territorial integrity.</p><p>In addition to his political and military activities, Abashidze was also an entrepreneur and businessman. He was involved in the construction and real estate industries, and his business interests often intersected with his political activities. Some of his detractors accused him of using his position in the Mkhedrioni to further his own financial interests, although these allegations were never proven.</p><p>Following Abashidze's death, the Mkhedrioni gradually declined in influence and was disbanded in the late 1990s. Despite its controversial legacy, the organization played a significant role in protecting Georgia's sovereignty and paving the way for the country's transition to democracy.</p><p>Today, Abashidze's memory is still celebrated by many Georgians, with streets and public squares named after him in several cities. However, his legacy remains contested, with some remembering him as a hero and others as a divisive and controversial figure.</p><p></p><p>
