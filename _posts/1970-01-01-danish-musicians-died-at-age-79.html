									</h1><p>Here are 17 famous musicians from Denmark died at 79:</p><h2>Carl Theodor Dreyer</h2><p><strong>Carl Theodor Dreyer</strong>
(February 3, 1889		Copenhagen-March 20, 1968			Frederiksberg)

	
		also known as Carl Dreyer, Carl Th. Dreyer, Carl Theodor Dreyer, Jr. or Carl-Th. Dreyer

	
was
a Danish
film director, film editor, screenwriter, film art director, film producer, actor and journalist.


					</p><p>Dreyer is best known for his visually striking and emotionally intense films, which often explored themes of faith, redemption, and the human condition. His most famous works include "The Passion of Joan of Arc" (1928), "Vampyr" (1932), and "Ordet" (1955).</p><p>Dreyer began his career in journalism before turning to film in the 1910s. He quickly gained a reputation for his innovative filmmaking techniques, such as the use of close-ups and dramatic lighting. Despite facing numerous setbacks throughout his career, including financial difficulties and censorship, Dreyer continued to produce groundbreaking films that remain influential to this day.</p><p>Beyond his filmmaking, Dreyer was also known for his deep spiritual beliefs and his interest in the supernatural. He famously claimed to have seen the ghost of his deceased mother, an experience that reportedly influenced his filmmaking.</p><p>Today, Dreyer is remembered as one of the greatest filmmakers in cinema history, and his films continue to be studied and admired by film scholars and cinephiles around the world.</p><p>Dreyer was born to a working-class family in Copenhagen, Denmark. His parents were both servants in a household, and his father died when Dreyer was just three years old. Despite these challenges, Dreyer showed a strong interest in the arts from a young age, and he went on to study at the Danish Technical School before taking up his career in journalism.</p><p>Dreyer's early films were mostly silent and often experimental in nature. He gained recognition in the film world for his use of intense close-ups and his willingness to tackle challenging subjects. His 1924 film, "Michael," was controversial for its exploration of homosexuality, and it was initially banned in several countries.</p><p>In the late 1920s, Dreyer made what is widely considered to be his masterpiece, "The Passion of Joan of Arc." The film, which starred French actress Renee Falconetti in the title role, is a stunning depiction of the trial and execution of the French saint. With its stark close-ups and emotional intensity, the film remains one of the most moving portrayals of faith ever captured on film.</p><p>Despite the success of "Joan of Arc," Dreyer continued to struggle with funding for his films. His 1932 film, "Vampyr," was a commercial failure, and his next film, "Day of Wrath," was banned by the Nazis during World War II. It wasn't until the 1950s, when he made "Ordet," that Dreyer enjoyed widespread acclaim once again.</p><p>Dreyer's legacy continues to influence filmmakers today, particularly in his use of minimalist visuals and his exploration of the intersection between spirituality and humanity.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by pneumonia.
