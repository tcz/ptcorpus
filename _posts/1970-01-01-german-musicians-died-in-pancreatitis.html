						Hindemith studied music in Frankfurt and played in that city's opera orchestra before serving in World War I. After the war, he joined the Frankfurt-based Amar Quartet and became professor of composition at the Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Musik. In the 1920s and 1930s, he developed a reputation as an innovative composer and was a leading figure in Germany's musical avant-garde. </p><p>However, with the rise of the Nazi party, Hindemith's music was labeled "degenerate" and he was forced to flee Germany in 1938. He settled in the United States, where he taught at Yale University and became a naturalized citizen. During this time, he continued to compose and conduct music, often integrating elements of jazz and American folk music into his work.</p><p>After World War II, Hindemith returned to Europe and settled in Switzerland. He continued to be an influential figure in the world of classical music, composing in a variety of genres including orchestral works, chamber music, operas, and ballets. He died in Frankfurt in 1963 at the age of 68.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=81469" title="Wikipedia article about Paul Hindemith">Paul Hindemith on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/indonesian-musicians-died-at-age-71.html' title='Indonesian musicians died at age 71'><strong>Indonesian musicians died at age 71</strong> List of the top 9 Indonesian music stars who died when they were 71</a></li><li><a href='/iranian-musicians-died-at-age-80.html' title='Iranian musicians died at age 80'><strong>Iranian musicians died at age 80</strong> List of the top 5 Iranian music stars who died when they were 80</a></li><li><a href='/polish-musicians-died-before-turning-30.html' title='Polish musicians died before turning 30'><strong>Polish musicians died before turning 30</strong> List of the top 24 Polish music stars who died before 30</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/west-german-musicians-died-at-age-78.html' title='West German musicians died at age 78'><strong>West German musicians died at age 78</strong> List of the top 2 West German music stars who died when they were 78</a></li><li><a href='/burundian-musicians-died-before-turning-35.html' title='Burundian musicians died before turning 35'><strong>Burundian musicians died before turning 35</strong> List of the top 1 Burundian music stars who died before 35</a></li><li><a href='/greek-musicians-born-in-1934.html' title='Greek musicians born in 1934'><strong>Greek musicians born in 1934</strong> List of the top 6 Greek  music stars who died in who were born in 1934</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
