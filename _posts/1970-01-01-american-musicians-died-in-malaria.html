					</p><p>Horatio Spafford is best known for writing the popular hymn "It Is Well with My Soul" after experiencing a series of tragedies in his life, including the death of his son, a fire that destroyed his real estate investments, and the deaths of his four daughters in a shipwreck while crossing the Atlantic. He and his wife Anna had planned to travel with their children on that fateful voyage but had to cancel at the last minute due to a business emergency. Despite these hardships, Spafford continued to write music and practice law throughout his life, including working as a prominent attorney in Chicago during the late 1800s. He was also an active member of the Plymouth Brethren, a non-denominational Christian movement that emphasized the importance of biblical literalism and the second coming of Christ.</p><p>In addition to his legal and musical pursuits, Horatio Spafford was also a staunch supporter of philanthropic causes. He and his wife established the Spafford Children's Center in Jerusalem, which provided housing, education, and medical care to orphaned and underprivileged children in the Holy Land. Spafford himself traveled extensively throughout Europe and the Middle East, meeting with religious leaders and advocating for peace and justice in the region. Despite the personal tragedies that plagued him, Horatio Spafford remained a man of deep faith and conviction throughout his life, leaving a lasting legacy both as a songwriter and as a humanitarian.</p><p>In addition to his philanthropic work, Horatio Spafford was also an active abolitionist during a time of great political unrest in the United States. He and his wife, Anna, were both staunch supporters of the anti-slavery movement and used their home in Chicago as a stop on the Underground Railroad, a network of secret routes and safe houses used to help slaves escape to freedom in the North. Spafford also served as a delegate to the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840, where he met and befriended prominent abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass.</p><p>Throughout his life, Spafford was deeply committed to his faith and often used his music as a means of expressing his spiritual beliefs. In addition to "It Is Well with My Soul," he wrote many other hymns and sacred songs that were widely popular during his lifetime. His music has continued to be cherished by Christians around the world and remains an important part of the hymnals used in many churches today.</p><p>Horatio Spafford's life was one of great hardship and tragedy, but also one of profound faith and conviction. Through his legal career, his philanthropic work, and his music, he left a lasting impact on the world and continues to inspire people today with his message of hope and resilience in the face of adversity.</p><p>Horatio Spafford was born in Troy, New York, in 1828, and grew up in a devout Christian household. He attended the University of Rochester and later became a successful lawyer in Chicago, where he married Anna Larsen in 1861. The couple had four daughters, and it was the tragic loss of these girls that led him to write "It Is Well with My Soul." The Spaffords' only surviving child, a son named Horatio, later became a Christian preacher.</p><p>After the deaths of their daughters, Horatio and Anna decided to move to Jerusalem and devote themselves to helping others. They established the Spafford Children's Center there, and also helped to establish a hospital in the city. Horatio Spafford died in Jerusalem in 1888 and is buried in the city's Mount Zion Cemetery. By that time, he had become known not just as a songwriter but also as a respected philanthropist and humanitarian.</p><p></p><p>
