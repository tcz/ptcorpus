						</p><p>Ko Yong-hui was the fourth wife of former North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-il. She was known to have a great passion for the performing arts, and worked as a dancer for the Mansudae Art Troupe before becoming a personal part of Kim Jong-il's entourage. Together, Ko and Kim had two sons - Kim Jong-un and Kim Jong-chul. Ko was reportedly very close to her sons and was a strong support to them, especially when their father passed away in 2011. She passed away in Paris in 2004, at the age of 51, after a long battle with breast cancer. Despite her relatively short life, Ko Yong-hui is remembered as a key figure in North Korean history and a beloved figure for the people of the country.</p><p>Ko Yong-hui was born in Japan to Korean parents who had emigrated there. She was raised in relative obscurity until she caught the eye of Kim Jong-il, who was reportedly smitten by her beauty and talent as a dancer. Despite opposition from Kim Il-sung, his father and North Korea's founder, Kim Jong-il eventually married Ko in 1977.</p><p>Ko Yong-hui's role as Kim Jong-il's wife was largely ceremonial, as he reportedly maintained a harem of mistresses and often traveled without her. However, she was known to be a trusted confidante and adviser to her husband, and was said to have played a key role in grooming their son Kim Jong-un as his successor.</p><p>Ko's death from breast cancer was kept secret by the North Korean government at the time, and was not publicly acknowledged until years later. However, she remained a revered figure in North Korean propaganda, with her image appearing on posters and other propaganda materials.</p><p>Despite her high profile as the wife of a dictator and the mother of a future leader, little is known about Ko Yong-hui's personal life and beliefs. However, her legacy lives on through her sons, with Kim Jong-un assuming power after his father's death and continuing to rule North Korea with an iron fist.</p><p>Ko Yong-hui's passion for the performing arts was evident from an early age. She began dancing while still in elementary school and went on to become a member of the Mansudae Art Troupe, one of North Korea's most prestigious performing arts groups. Her talent as a dancer caught the eye of Kim Jong-il, who was known to be a patron of the arts and a lover of music and dance.</p><p>Despite her privileged position as the wife of a dictator, Ko Yong-hui remained connected to her humble roots. She was known to be humble and kind, and would often spend time with ordinary people. She was also a devoted mother who loved spending time with her children and was said to have a close bond with both Kim Jong-un and Kim Jong-chul.</p><p>Ko Yong-hui's legacy in North Korea is complex. While she is remembered as a beloved figure by many North Koreans, others criticize her role as the wife of a dictator and the mother of a future leader. Some see her as complicit in the abuses and atrocities committed by the North Korean regime, while others argue that she was a victim of circumstance who had little choice but to go along with her husband's wishes.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding her life, Ko Yong-hui remains a fascinating figure in North Korean history. Her story offers a glimpse into the human side of a tightly-controlled regime, and her legacy continues to be felt in the country's politics and culture to this day.</p><p>Ko Yong-hui's sons, Kim Jong-un and Kim Jong-chul, have both gone on to have prominent roles in North Korean politics. Kim Jong-un succeeded his father as leader of North Korea and has continued his family's authoritarian rule, overseeing a number of high-profile military tests and tensions with foreign powers. Kim Jong-chul, on the other hand, is less involved in politics and is said to have a passion for music. Though he was once considered a possible successor to his father, he has largely stayed out of the public eye in recent years. Despite their different paths, both Kim Jong-un and Kim Jong-chul have spoken fondly of their mother and credited her with shaping their values and worldview.</p><p></p><p>
						She died caused by breast cancer.
