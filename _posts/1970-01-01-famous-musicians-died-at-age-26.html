									</h1><p>Here are 4 famous musicians from the world died at 26:</p><h2>Frank P. Ramsey</h2><p><strong>Frank P. Ramsey</strong>
(February 22, 1903		Cambridge-January 19, 1930)

	
		also known as Frank Ramsey or Frank Plumpton Ramsey

	
was
a British
economist, philosopher, mathematician and scientist.


					</p><p>Ramsey made significant contributions to multiple fields during his short life, including philosophy, logic, mathematics, and economics. He is best known for his work in logic, where he developed the theory of truth that is now known as the redundancy theory. This theory suggests that in order to understand what is meant by a sentence, one simply needs to understand the relations between the words in that sentence.</p><p>In the field of economics, Ramsey was a pioneer of intertemporal analysis, which studies how people make decisions over time. His contributions to this area helped lay the foundation for modern macroeconomics. Ramsey also made important contributions to decision theory, which studies how people make decisions under conditions of uncertainty.</p><p>Ramsey's work in mathematics included the development of the Ramsey theory, which studies the conditions for the existence of a certain type of structure within a larger object. This work has important applications in computer science, combinatorics, and graph theory.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Ramsey's life was tragically cut short by jaundice at the age of only 26. Nonetheless, his contributions to a variety of fields have continued to influence research for decades after his death.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by jaundice.
