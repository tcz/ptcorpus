(February 22, 1903		Cambridge-January 19, 1930)

	
		also known as Frank Ramsey or Frank Plumpton Ramsey

	
was
a British
economist, philosopher, mathematician and scientist.


					</p><p>Ramsey made significant contributions to multiple fields during his short life, including philosophy, logic, mathematics, and economics. He is best known for his work in logic, where he developed the theory of truth that is now known as the redundancy theory. This theory suggests that in order to understand what is meant by a sentence, one simply needs to understand the relations between the words in that sentence.</p><p>In the field of economics, Ramsey was a pioneer of intertemporal analysis, which studies how people make decisions over time. His contributions to this area helped lay the foundation for modern macroeconomics. Ramsey also made important contributions to decision theory, which studies how people make decisions under conditions of uncertainty.</p><p>Ramsey's work in mathematics included the development of the Ramsey theory, which studies the conditions for the existence of a certain type of structure within a larger object. This work has important applications in computer science, combinatorics, and graph theory.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Ramsey's life was tragically cut short by jaundice at the age of only 26. Nonetheless, his contributions to a variety of fields have continued to influence research for decades after his death.</p><p>Ramsey grew up in a highly academic family - his father was a mathematician and president of Magdalene College, Cambridge, while his mother was a suffragist and social activist. Ramsey himself showed signs of intellectual brilliance at an early age, publishing his first paper in mathematics at the age of just 17. He went on to study at Cambridge, where he became a close friend of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.</p><p>Ramsey's work in philosophy was highly influential, particularly in the areas of semantics and metaphysics. He argued that truth is a property of whole propositions rather than individual statements, and he developed the notion of a ramified hierarchy to explain the logical relations between propositions.</p><p>Ramsey's contributions to economics were similarly ground-breaking. He developed the concept of optimal taxation, which seeks to balance the revenue-generating potential of taxation with the economic costs of raising taxes. He also formulated the idea of a Ramsey rule, which helps policymakers determine the optimal rate of consumption in an economy.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Ramsey was known for his modesty and humility, and he remained relatively unknown outside academic circles during his lifetime. It was only after his death that his work began to receive the recognition it deserved. Today, Ramsey's contributions to fields as diverse as philosophy, economics, and mathematics continue to inspire research and scholarship around the world.</p><p>Ramsey's legacy also extended to his personal life. He was known for his kindness and generosity, and he was a dedicated member of his community. He volunteered his time and resources to help those in need, and he was involved in various philanthropic organizations. In addition, Ramsey had a passion for outdoor adventure, and he enjoyed hiking, fishing, and camping in his free time. His love of nature and the outdoors inspired him to become a conservationist, and he advocated for the preservation of natural resources throughout his life. Overall, Frank Ramsey was a brilliant and accomplished individual who made significant contributions to multiple fields, and his legacy continues to impact research and scholarship around the world.</p><p></p><p>
