was
an American
mathematician, scientist, engineer and science writer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work in the field of mechanics, where he made significant contributions to the study of vibrations and the dynamics of rigid bodies. Woodward's scientific career began at the age of 18, when he became a professor of mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis. He later worked as an engineer for various railroad companies and the US Geological Survey. Woodward also served as the president of the American Mathematical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In addition to his scientific work, he was also a prolific writer, publishing many popular science articles and several books, including "The Age of Invention" and "The Mechanical Triumphs of the Ancient Egyptians". Woodward's legacy lives on through the Woodward Medal, which is awarded annually by the American Mathematical Society in recognition of outstanding contributions to mathematical research.</p><p>Throughout his career, Woodward made significant contributions to the field of mechanics, particularly in the area of vibrations and wave propagation in solid bodies. He was one of the early pioneers of graphical methods in structural analysis and is credited with developing the Woodward's graphical method. This method was an important tool in engineering design and analysis until the development of modern computer-based numerical methods.</p><p>Woodward also made notable contributions to the field of seismology. In 1906, he was the first person to propose a theory of faulting that accounted for large earthquakes. This theory, which is now known as the Woodward's hypothesis, suggested that earthquakes were caused by the sudden rupture of rock masses along a fault. His work on seismology helped lay the foundation for modern earthquake engineering and the study of earthquake hazards.</p><p>Outside of his scientific work, Woodward was an avid traveler and wrote extensively about his experiences. He visited many countries, including Egypt, China, and Japan, and wrote several books on his travels. His book "The Mechanical Triumphs of the Ancient Egyptians" is still regarded as a classic in the field of Egyptology.</p><p>Woodward died in June 1924, but his contributions to the field of mechanics and seismology continue to be influential to this day.</p><p>One of the most notable contributions Woodward made to the field of mechanics was during his time at Columbia University, where he worked as a professor of mechanics and mathematical physics. During this time, he wrote a highly regarded textbook titled "Mechanics of Materials", which was widely used in engineering programs for many years. Woodward also conducted important research on the behavior of beams under various loads, which helped to advance the understanding of the mechanics of materials.</p><p>In addition to his many contributions to the scientific community, Woodward was also highly respected as a teacher and mentor. He had a gift for explaining complex scientific concepts in a clear and accessible way and was renowned for his ability to inspire and motivate his students. Many of his former students went on to achieve great success in their own careers and continued to be influenced by Woodward's teachings throughout their lives.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Woodward remained humble and dedicated to his work throughout his life. He believed that science should be driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the world around us and was always willing to collaborate with others to advance scientific knowledge. His contributions to the field of mechanics and seismology continue to be celebrated and recognized today, and he remains an enduring figure in the history of science and engineering.</p><p></p><p>
