Despite Colombia's disappointing performance in the World Cup, Escobar was highly respected by his teammates and fans alike for his dedication to the sport.</p><p>Tragically, just 10 days after returning to Colombia following the World Cup, Escobar was shot and killed outside a bar in Medellín. His murder was believed to be in retaliation for an own goal he scored during a match against the United States, which contributed to Colombia's early exit from the World Cup. Escobar's death shook the football world and sparked outrage in Colombia over the senseless violence that had become all too common in the country at that time.</p><p>In addition to his successful football career, Andrés Escobar was also known for his philanthropic work off the field.

Escobar was also an advocate for peace in Colombia and used his platform to speak out against violence and corruption in the country. Following his death, Escobar's legacy has continued to inspire and his memory has been honored in various ways, including through documentaries, memorials, and the annual "Andrés Escobar Fair Play Award," which recognizes sportsmanship and fair play in football. His death remains a tragic reminder of the violence and turmoil that plagued Colombia during that time, and the need for peace and justice in the country.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Andrés Escobar's impact on football and Colombian society lives on. He is still considered one of the greatest defenders in Colombian football history and his legacy as a passionate, dedicated and fair player is celebrated around the world. In 2002, he was inducted into the Colombian Football Hall of Fame, and in 2004, ESPN named him the third-best Colombian footballer of all time. In 2010, a documentary film titled "The Two Escobars" was released, exploring the parallel lives of Andrés Escobar and Pablo Escobar, the infamous drug lord who terrorized Colombia. The film showcased Andres' love for football and country, and his efforts to bring social change to Colombia through his foundation, El Jardin. Today, his memory lives on through the foundation and through the annual Andrés Escobar Fair Play Award, which is given to players who demonstrate the highest standards of sportsmanship and fair play.

(September 29, 1951		Cali-March 4, 1977)

	
		a.k.a. Andres Caicedo

	
was
a Colombian
novelist, poet and playwright.


					</p><p>Andrés Caicedo is best known for his novel "¡Que viva la música!", which was published in 1977, the same year he passed away. The novel is a semi-autobiographical account of Caicedo's experiences in Cali, Colombia's nightlife scene, and is widely regarded as a classic of Colombian literature. Despite Caicedo's relatively short career, his work has had a significant impact on Colombian culture and his influence can be seen in the works of many Colombian writers and artists today. In addition to writing, Caicedo was also a prominent figure in Cali's counterculture scene, and was involved in the production of several underground literary and artistic publications. Despite his tragic death at the young age of 25, Caicedo's work continues to be celebrated by fans and scholars alike.</p><p>Andrés Caicedo was born in Cali, Colombia, where he spent most of his life. He began writing at a young age, and by the time he was a teenager, he had already started to gain a reputation as a talented young writer. In 1970, at the age of 19, he enrolled in the Universidad del Valle, where he studied philosophy and literature.</p><p>Throughout his short but prolific career, Caicedo wrote several novels, plays, and poems, many of which explore the themes of youth, rebellion, and counterculture. His works are characterized by their raw, honest style and their unflinching portrayal of the darker aspects of life. In addition to ¡Que viva la música!, Caicedo's other notable works include the novels "El atravesado" and "Destinitos fatales", and the plays "Odisea" and "Adiós a la vida".</p><p>Despite his relatively small body of work, Andrés Caicedo is widely regarded as one of Colombia's most important literary figures of the 20th century. His influence can be seen in the works of many contemporary Colombian writers, and his legacy continues to be celebrated by fans and scholars alike.</p><p>Caicedo was also known for his love of music, particularly rock and roll, and this passion often found its way into his writing. He was a fan of bands like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin, and his works often feature references to their music. Caicedo was also involved in the production of a local music magazine called "Nueva Frontera", which helped to promote and support the burgeoning Colombian rock scene of the 1970s. Despite his success as a writer, Caicedo struggled with depression and a sense of disillusionment with the world around him. This, along with his use of drugs, ultimately led to his untimely death at the age of 25. Nevertheless, his work continues to be read and admired by new generations of readers, and his legacy as one of Colombia's most talented and influential writers remains secure.</p><p></p><p>
