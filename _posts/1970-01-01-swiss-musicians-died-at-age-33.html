Another son, Frédéric-César de La Harpe, became a noted writer and revolutionary who fought for democracy and human rights in Switzerland and France.</p><p>Chéseaux's legacy continued even further through his influence on future generations of scientists. His work on double stars inspired the famous astronomer William Herschel, who went on to discover Uranus and many other celestial objects.
