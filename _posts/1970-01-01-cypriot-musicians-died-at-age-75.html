					</p><p>Georgios Grivas was best known as the founder and leader of the notorious EOKA organization (National Organization of Cypriot Fighters) which sought to take Cyprus away from British rule and unite it with Greece. Grivas had a long and distinguished military career, serving in the Greek Army, where he fought in numerous conflicts, including both World Wars. He was also a veteran of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922.</p><p>However, it was in the context of the Cyprus Crisis of the 1950s that Grivas gained his greatest notoriety. He founded EOKA in 1955, and the group is responsible for some of the most daring and deadly attacks on British personnel and infrastructure in Cyprus. Grivas's leadership of the organization was so successful that he became known as the "Uncrowned King of Cyprus." After Cyprus's independence and the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus, Grivas's pro-Greek stance continued to cause tension, and he was eventually forced to leave the country. He died in exile in 1974, just as the Cyprus crisis was once again escalating.</p><p>Despite the controversial nature of his actions, Georgios Grivas remains a highly regarded figure amongst many Greeks and Greek Cypriots, who see him as a national hero. Grivas was also an author and wrote several books about his military experiences, including his autobiography "My Life". Prior to his involvement with EOKA, Grivas also helped found the Greek Labyrinth Society, a secret organization with the aim of promoting and perpetuating Hellenism. Grivas's influence can still be seen in modern-day Cyprus, where he is often cited as an inspiration for those seeking a unified Cyprus. His legacy, however, remains a divisive one, with many seeing him as a figure of controversy rather than a hero.</p><p>Grivas was born in Cyprus during a time when the island was under British occupation. He grew up in poverty and was forced to leave school at a young age to support his family. In 1916, at the age of 18, he traveled to Greece and joined the Greek Army. Grivas was highly decorated for his service, receiving the Cross of Valour twice and rising to the rank of General during his military career.</p><p>Grivas was also involved in politics, and his pro-Greek stance often put him at odds with both British and Cypriot authorities. After the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960, he founded a new organization called EOKA-B, which sought to annex Cyprus to Greece. This led to his eventual exile from Cyprus, and he spent the remainder of his life advocating for the unification of Cyprus with Greece.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Georgios Grivas remains a highly respected figure in Greek and Greek Cypriot history. His dedication to the cause of Hellenism and his leadership during some of the most turbulent times in Cyprus's history has ensured his place in the annals of history.</p><p>Georgios Grivas was also known for his unique military tactics and unconventional methods of warfare. He believed in guerrilla warfare and favored hit-and-run tactics, which made it difficult for the British to capture him and his followers. Even after the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus, Grivas continued to advocate for the annexation of the island to Greece, and EOKA-B carried out several attacks in support of his cause.</p><p>In addition to his military and political careers, Georgios Grivas was also a highly educated man. He spoke several languages fluently, including English, French, Italian, Turkish, and Arabic. He was also a prolific writer and contributed articles to several Greek newspapers and magazines throughout his life.</p><p>Grivas's personal life was marked by tragedy. He married his wife, Vasia, in 1935, and the couple had two children, a son and a daughter. However, both of their children died at a young age, which caused immense grief for the couple. Vasia passed away in 1970, just a few years before Grivas's own death.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, Georgios Grivas remains an important figure in the history of Cyprus and Greece. He was a passionate advocate for the unification of Cyprus and Greece, and his leadership and military expertise played a significant role in the fight for Cypriot independence.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of heart failure.
