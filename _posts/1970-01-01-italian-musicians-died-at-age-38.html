		also known as Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio or Caravaggio, Michelangelo Merisi da

	
was
an Italian
artist, painter and visual artist.


					</p><p>Caravaggio was known for his striking use of chiaroscuro, a technique of using intense contrast between light and dark. He often depicted religious scenes and was known for his dramatic and realistic portrayal of the human figure. However, his personal life was tumultuous and he had a reputation for a volatile temper and getting into fights. In 1606, he killed a man in a brawl and was forced to flee Rome. He spent the rest of his life on the run, moving between Naples, Malta, and Sicily before dying under mysterious circumstances at the age of 38. Despite his controversial life and reputation, Caravaggio is widely regarded as one of the most influential and important artists of the Baroque period. His style had a profound impact on subsequent generations of artists, and his work continues to be celebrated and studied today.</p><p>Caravaggio was born into a family of modest means, and his early years were marked by hardship and financial struggles. He began his artistic career as an apprentice to a painter in Milan, but he soon moved to Rome, where he began to establish himself as an artist in his own right.</p><p>In Rome, Caravaggio quickly gained a reputation for his groundbreaking style, which was characterized by a vivid, almost hyper-realistic approach to painting. He eschewed the traditional idealized portrayals of religious figures in favor of a more raw and humanized depiction of saints and biblical characters.</p><p>Despite his success as an artist, Caravaggio's personal life was troubled. He was known for his violent temper and his penchant for getting into fights, and he was often involved in brawls and skirmishes with other artists and members of the public.</p><p>In 1606, Caravaggio's violent lifestyle caught up with him when he killed a man in a fight over a gambling debt. He was forced to flee Rome and spent the rest of his life on the run, moving between Naples, Malta, and Sicily.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced in his personal life, Caravaggio remained a prolific artist throughout his career. He produced a large number of masterpieces, including his famous paintings of Saint Matthew and The Conversion of Saint Paul.</p><p>Today, Caravaggio is widely regarded as one of the most important artists of the Baroque period, and his influence can be seen in the work of many subsequent artists. His innovations in chiaroscuro and his realistic approach to painting helped to shape the direction of European art in the years that followed.</p><p>Caravaggio's work was controversial during his lifetime, and he faced criticism from some members of the Church for his use of unconventional models and settings, as well as his inclusion of realistic depictions of blood and gore in his religious paintings. Despite this, he continued to receive commissions from wealthy patrons and was able to produce some of his most iconic works, such as The Calling of Saint Matthew and The Entombment of Christ.</p><p>Caravaggio's legacy has continued to inspire artists across the centuries. His influence can be seen in the work of the Baroque and Rococo painters who followed him, as well as in the realism and dramatic lighting effects of later artists, including Rembrandt and Vermeer. Today, Caravaggio's works are held in major museums and galleries around the world, and his contributions to the development of Western art are widely recognized.</p><p>In recent years, Caravaggio's personal life has become the subject of renewed interest and study. Many scholars believe that his volatile temperament and troubled personal relationships may have contributed to the passionate intensity of his artistic vision. Additionally, there has been ongoing debate over the circumstances surrounding his death, with some theories suggesting that he may have been the victim of assassination. Despite the many questions that remain unanswered about Caravaggio's life and work, his legacy as one of the most innovative and influential artists of his time continues to endure.</p><p>Caravaggio's style of chiaroscuro, which emphasizes the contrast between light and dark, was a major contribution to the art world. This style was further enhanced by his use of everyday people as models for religious figures, producing a more realistic portrayal. Caravaggio's art was a reflection of his controversial life and the Caravaggism movement he started extended his influence beyond his native Italy to France and Spain. Despite being mostly appreciated by the younger generation of artists, Caravaggio's art remained controversial and he was often criticized for his errors in perspective and composition. However, his influence on art is undeniable and he remains one of the most significant painters of the Baroque era.</p><p></p><p>

(June 29, 1798		Recanati-June 14, 1837			Naples)

	
		also known as Leopardi, Giacomo

	
was
an Italian
philosopher, author, poet and essayist.


					</p><p>Leopardi's works often focused on themes of suffering, mortality, and the human condition. He grew up in a wealthy family and was largely self-taught in his studies. His works include "Operette Morali" (Moral Essays), "Canti" (Songs), and the "Zibaldone" - a massive collection of his philosophical musings and observations. Despite his brief life, he had a significant impact on Italian literature and culture and is considered one of the most important Italian writers of the 19th century. He was also known for his vast knowledge of languages, including ancient Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and was able to read Persian and Arabic as well.</p><p>Leopardi was also interested in science and astronomy and his studies can be seen in his writings. In his poem "La ginestra" (The Broom), he discusses the natural world and the infinite universe, reflecting his fascination with these themes. Despite his literary fame, Leopardi battled with poor health all his life, including a curvature of the spine and poor eyesight. He spent much of his life in isolation and suffering, which is reflected in his writings. His works influenced many Italian writers and thinkers, including Gabriele D'Annunzio, and his poems have been set to music by composers such as Franz Liszt and Sergei Rachmaninoff. Today, Leopardi is revered as an important cultural icon in Italy, and his works are still studied and celebrated around the world.</p><p>Leopardi lived during a turbulent time in Italian history, with the country facing political turmoil and social upheaval. He often expressed his disillusionment with the political state of Italy in his writings, and was critical of the Italian unification movement. Despite this, his works were popular among Italian nationalists, who saw in his poetry a reflection of their own struggles and aspirations for a united Italy. Leopardi's influence on Italian literature and culture continued to grow in the years after his death, with many Italian intellectuals and writers paying tribute to him in their works. His legacy also extends beyond Italy, with his poetry and philosophy having an impact on writers and thinkers around the world. Today, he is remembered as a literary giant whose deeply personal works continue to inspire and resonate with readers.</p><p>Leopardi's experiences with illness and isolation also led him to explore the themes of melancholy and despair in his works. In "L'infinito" (The Infinite), he reflects on the vastness of the universe and the limitations of human existence, while in "A Silvia" he mourns the loss of a friend and reflects on the fleeting nature of life. Despite these darker themes, Leopardi's works also contain moments of beauty and hope, with his poetry often celebrated for its musicality and lyrical qualities. </p><p>Leopardi's influence can also be seen in the development of the Italian language. His use of regional dialects and colloquial language in his works helped to break down the rigid, formal language used in Italian literature at the time, and paved the way for the modern Italian vernacular. He is also credited with helping to shape the Romantic movement in Italy, with his poetry and philosophy expressing a sense of individualism and introspection that was influential in the development of Romanticism in Italy.</p><p>In addition to his literary achievements, Leopardi's legacy also includes his contributions to the field of lexicography. He was known for his extensive knowledge of language, and his "Zibaldone" contains numerous entries on the origins and meanings of words in various languages. His interest in language and linguistics helped to establish the scientific study of language in Italy, and his works continue to be studied and celebrated in the field of linguistics to this day.</p><p>Leopardi's early life was marked by tragedy, as he lost many family members to illness and death, including his mother, father, and younger brother. His own health struggles only added to his sense of isolation and despair. Despite this, he continued to pursue his studies and writing, and gained the admiration of many prominent intellectuals at the time, including Alessandro Manzoni and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In his later years, he traveled extensively throughout Italy and Europe, and became involved in various intellectual circles. However, his health continued to decline, and he died at the age of 38 from a lung infection. Today, Leopardi is widely regarded as one of Italy's most brilliant and influential thinkers, whose legacy continues to inspire and fascinate readers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
