									</h1><p>Here are 15 famous musicians from Japan died at 62:</p><h2>Nogi Maresuke</h2><p><strong>Nogi Maresuke</strong>
(December 25, 1849		Edo-September 13, 1912			Tokyo)

	
		also known as Count Nogi Maresuke, Maresuke Nogi, General Maresuke Nogi or General Nogi

	
was
a Japanese
personality.


					</p><p>Nogi Maresuke was a prominent general in the Imperial Japanese Army and a veteran of several major wars. He played a crucial role in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05, leading the Japanese forces to victory at the Battle of Port Arthur. He later served as the military governor of Korea, where he worked to modernize the country's infrastructure and institutions.</p><p>After his retirement from military service, Nogi became known for his adherence to the samurai code of bushido and his deep sense of loyalty to the emperor. He became a symbol of Japan's reverence for tradition and discipline, and his suicide following the death of Emperor Meiji was seen as a tragic symbol of the passing of an era. Nogi and his wife both chose to end their own lives as a sign of devotion to the emperor, an act that has been deeply mythologized in Japanese culture.</p><p>Nogi Maresuke was born into a family of low-ranking samurai and began his military career at the age of 17 when he joined the Tokugawa Shogunate's army during the Boshin War. Nogi was known for his exceptional leadership skills and combat abilities, which earned him many promotions and accolades throughout his career.</p><p>In addition to his military career, Nogi was also deeply interested in education and played a key role in founding Tokyo Imperial University. He emphasized the importance of a strong education system in Japan's modernization and development.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Nogi's life was not without controversy. His role in the brutal suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900 and his harsh treatment of Korean rebels during his governance of Korea have been criticized by some as examples of imperialist aggression.</p><p>However, Nogi remains a respected figure in Japanese history and his legacy continues to inspire many in Japan. The Nogi Shrine, built in his honor after his death, remains a popular tourist attraction in Tokyo and draws many visitors who come to pay their respects to one of Japan's most celebrated military heroes.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by suicide.
