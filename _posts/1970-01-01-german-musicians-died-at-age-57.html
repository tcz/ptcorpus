was
a German
chemist.


					</p><p>He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1907 for his work on fermentation, which he conducted while working as a lecturer at the University of Berlin.

This work was critical in the development of the field of biochemistry. He later became a professor at the University of Breslau and then at the University of Würzburg. During his career, he made many other contributions to the fields of chemistry and biochemistry, including work on protein metabolism, the structure of nucleic acids, and the chemistry of enzymes. He died in 1917 at the age of 57.</p><p>Buchner was born into a family of distinguished scientists and scholars, with his father and uncle both being professors of medicine. After studying chemistry in Munich, Buchner earned his Ph.D. from the University of Berlin in 1888. Throughout his career, he maintained a strong interest in both organic chemistry and biochemistry, publishing numerous papers and books on these subjects. </p><p>In addition to his groundbreaking work on fermentation, Buchner also conducted research on the enzymatic breakdown of carbohydrates, the formation of proteins in living organisms, and the metabolism of fats. He was a prolific writer, publishing many papers and books on these and other topics. </p><p>Buchner's contributions to chemistry and biochemistry had a profound impact on the scientific community of his time and laid the groundwork for future discoveries in these fields. He was recognized for his achievements with numerous honors and awards, including the Davy Medal of the Royal Society in 1911. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of biochemistry.</p><p></p><p>

He continued to write poetry and remained politically active, advocating for workers' rights and socialism. In addition to his work as a poet, Herwegh also published a memoir, "Erinnerungen aus dem Jahre 1848" (Memories of the Year 1848), which provided insight into his experiences during the revolutionary period.</p><p>Today, Herwegh is remembered as a key figure in 19th-century German literature and politics, and his poetry remains relevant for its critiques of social injustice and calls for democratic reform.</p><p></p><p>

(October 8, 1884		Karlsruhe-January 17, 1942			Poltava)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Walther von Reichenau was a military commander who served in both World War I and World War II. He rose to the rank of Field Marshal in the German Wehrmacht during World War II and was involved in several major campaigns, including the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. </p><p>Despite his military accomplishments, von Reichenau was also known for his controversial views. He was a committed Nazi and expressed extreme hatred towards Jews and other minority groups. He was a key figure in the implementation of the Nazi's "Commissar Order," which called for the execution of all Soviet political commissars. </p><p>Von Reichenau's military career came to an abrupt end in early 1942 when he suffered a fatal heart attack while visiting troops in Ukraine. While some saw his death as a loss for the German war effort, others have noted that his death may have saved the lives of countless innocent civilians who would have been targeted by his brutal tactics.</p><p>During his time as a military commander, Walther von Reichenau was highly regarded for his tactical abilities and leadership skills. He was involved in the Blitzkrieg campaigns that rapidly invaded and occupied several European countries such as Poland, the Netherlands, and Belgium, making him one of the most successful German commanders during the early stages of World War II.</p><p>Von Reichenau was also known for his extensive military training and experience, which included serving as a military attaché in both Japan and Turkey. His experience enabled him to adapt quickly to different combat scenarios, making him a highly effective soldier and military leader.</p><p>Despite his military achievements, von Reichenau's legacy is marred by his fervent support of Nazi ideology and his active participation in the implementation of the Final Solution, which aimed to exterminate Jews and other minority groups. In a notorious speech delivered in Ukraine in 1941, he called for the extermination of Jews, stating that they were "the bearer of Bolshevik terror." Von Reichenau's speech is considered by many as a key factor in the escalation of violence towards Jews and other minority groups.</p><p>Today, von Reichenau is remembered as a controversial figure in German military history, his military successes overshadowed by his beliefs and actions as a committed Nazi.</p><p></p><p>

(April 19, 1889		Wurzen-November 22, 1946			Paderborn)


was
a German
politician.


					</p><p>Thierack played an instrumental role in the Nazi regime and was the Reich Minister of Justice from 1942 until 1945. He oversaw numerous war crimes committed against civilians and prisoners of war during World War II, including the execution of hostages and the sentencing of political dissidents to concentration camps. After the fall of the Third Reich, Thierack was arrested by the Allies and charged with war crimes. He died by suicide in prison before he could face trial.</p><p>Before his involvement in the Nazi regime, Thierack had a successful legal career as a judge and prosecutor. He joined the Nazi Party in 1930 and became a member of the SS in 1933. Thierack's appointment as Reich Minister of Justice in 1942 gave him significant power within the Nazi government, and he used this power to further the regime's goals of exterminating so-called "undesirables." During his tenure, Thierack made significant changes to the German legal system, implementing harsher sentences for even minor offenses and allowing judges to hand down death sentences without the possibility of appeal. His policies resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, many of whom were innocent civilians targeted solely for their ethnicity or political beliefs. Thierack's legacy is one of cruelty and injustice, and his death prevented him from being held accountable for his role in some of the worst atrocities in human history.</p><p></p><p>
