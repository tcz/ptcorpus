(June 19, 1623		Clermont-Ferrand-August 19, 1662			Paris)


was
a French
physicist, writer, philosopher, mathematician and inventor.


					</p><p>Some of Pascal's most significant contributions include his work on probability theory and the development of the hydraulic press. He is also known for his religious writings, including the Pensées, which explore the nature of faith and the existence of God. Pascal was a prodigy from a young age, and his early work on projective geometry earned him recognition in the mathematical community. He later worked as a tax collector for his father, but continued to pursue his scientific and philosophical interests in his spare time. Despite struggling with health issues throughout his life, Pascal made valuable contributions to a wide range of fields and left a lasting impact on the world of science and philosophy.</p><p>In addition to his work in mathematics and physics, Pascal is famous for creating the first calculating machine, which originated from his father's work as a tax collector. Known as the Pascaline, the machine used a series of gears and wheels to make calculations faster and more accurate. Pascal's contributions to the understanding of atmospheric pressure and the principles of barometry also played a significant role in the development of the steam engine and the study of fluid dynamics. Apart from his work in science, Pascal was also known for his philosophical ideas, which influenced later thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Friedrich Nietzsche. Despite his relatively short life, Pascal left an indelible impression on the intellectual world and his work continues to be studied and admired today.</p><p>Pascal's religious beliefs also played a significant role in his life and work. In the mid-1650s, he had a religious experience that led him to become devoutly Christian. He subsequently abandoned his scientific work for a time and focused on theology, writing several influential works on the subject. Pascal's most famous religious work is the Pensées, a collection of notes on philosophy and religion that were published posthumously. The Pensées are known for their exploration of the "wager" argument for the existence of God, which posits that it makes more sense to believe in God (even without certainty) than to not believe, since the potential benefits of belief (eternal salvation) outweigh the potential risks of disbelief (eternal damnation).</p><p>Despite his contributions to both science and religion, Pascal's health issues continued to plague him throughout his life. He suffered from chronic headaches and stomach problems, and died at the age of 39. Nevertheless, Pascal's work continues to be celebrated and studied today, and he is remembered as one of the most brilliant minds of his time.</p><p></p><p>

(January 15, 1754		Chartres-October 31, 1793			Place de la Concorde)

	
		also known as J.-P. Brissot de Warville

	
was
a French
lawyer.


					</p><p>Jacques Pierre Brissot was also a French revolutionary leader and a prominent member of the Girondist faction in the National Convention. He was particularly concerned about the issue of slavery and was a leading advocate for the abolition of the slave trade. Brissot also played a crucial role in the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, encouraging France to declare war on Austria and Prussia in 1792. However, his political career came to an abrupt end when he was arrested and accused of being a counter-revolutionary. He was eventually condemned to death and executed by guillotine during the Reign of Terror. Brissot's legacy as a political agitator and his efforts to promote social and political reform continue to influence French politics to this day.</p><p>Prior to his involvement in politics, Jacques Pierre Brissot studied law and became a lawyer. He founded a newspaper called Le Patriote français, which he used to promote his political views and criticize the monarchy. His newspaper was widely read and became a platform for other political activists.</p><p>During the early years of the revolution, Brissot advocated for a more moderate approach, but later joined the ranks of the radicals. He was elected to the National Convention in 1792, and quickly rose to become one of the leaders of the Girondist faction. Along with his fellow Girondists, Brissot clashed with the more radical Jacobins, including Maximilien Robespierre.</p><p>Brissot's campaign against slavery began in earnest after he traveled to the United States and witnessed the slave trade in action. He became convinced that slavery was a moral abomination and began campaigning for its immediate abolition. His efforts eventually led to the passing of a decree in the National Convention to abolish slavery in the French colonies.</p><p>Despite his efforts to promote social and political reform, Brissot was eventually accused of treason by the revolutionary government. He was arrested and imprisoned, and after a show trial, he was found guilty of plotting against the government. Brissot was sentenced to death and executed by guillotine in 1793.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Jacques Pierre Brissot remains an important figure in French history. His advocacy for social and political reform inspired generations of political activists, and his fight against slavery helped set the stage for future abolitionist movements.</p><p>In addition to his political and abolitionist activities, Jacques Pierre Brissot was also a prolific writer. He wrote several books on politics, philosophy, and history, including "Recherches Philosophiques sur le Droit de Propriété et sur le Vol," which examined the nature of property rights, and "Histoire des Anciens Traites de Paix et d'Alliance," which chronicled the history of peace treaties and alliances between nations. Brissot's writings were widely read and helped to shape the political discourse of the time.</p><p>Brissot was also known for his internationalism and his efforts to build alliances between revolutionary France and other nations. He reached out to revolutionaries in Britain and the United States, and advocated for a united front against the forces of reaction and tyranny.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Brissot's legacy has been tarnished by his association with the Girondist faction and his role in the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. His political opponents accused him of being a warmonger and a traitor, and his support for the war effort ultimately led to his downfall.</p><p>Today, Jacques Pierre Brissot is remembered as a passionate advocate for social and political reform, a fierce opponent of slavery, and a courageous defender of human rights. His ideas and legacy continue to inspire activists and reformers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by guillotine.

(June 12, 1754		Rennes-April 22, 1794			Paris)

	
		a.k.a. Isaac Rene Guy le Chapelier

	
was
a French
lawyer and politician.


					</p><p>Isaac René Guy le Chapelier was a key figure in the French Revolution, known for his advocacy of the separation of powers and his role in drafting the Le Chapelier Law of 1791, which prohibited workers' associations and strikes. He was a member of the National Constituent Assembly and served as the President of the Assembly from 16 to 30 September 1791. Despite his early support for the Revolution, he became increasingly critical of extremist factions and was arrested in 1793. He was found guilty of "moderatism" and "federalist leanings" and was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal. He was executed by guillotine on April 22, 1794. His legacy is contentious, with some viewing him as a champion of individual freedom and others as a defender of the privileged classes.</p><p>Isaac René Guy le Chapelier was born into a wealthy family and received an excellent education, graduating with a degree in law. He established himself as a successful lawyer, winning many high-profile cases. He entered politics in 1789, after being elected as a deputy to the Estates-General. He was a member of the Jacobin Club and worked closely with Maximilien Robespierre, who he had befriended during their time together in the National Constituent Assembly. </p><p>Le Chapelier was a passionate advocate for democracy and played a key role in the drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. He passionately believed in the separation of powers and sought to limit the authority of the king. However, he was also strongly opposed to working-class organizations like trade unions, which he saw as a threat to individual liberty. He helped draft the Le Chapelier Law of 1791, which banned such organizations, a move that was widely criticized by left-wing radicals.</p><p>Despite his early support for the Revolution, Le Chapelier became increasingly disillusioned with the direction it was taking. He grew critical of the radicalism of the Mountain faction and was arrested in 1793. Tried and found guilty of "moderatism" and "federalist leanings," he was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal.</p><p>Le Chapelier's legacy continues to be the subject of intense debate. Supporters see him as a defender of individual freedom, while critics argue that his opposition to working-class organizations shows that he was more concerned with protecting the interests of the bourgeoisie. Nevertheless, his contribution to the French Revolution is undeniable, and his beliefs continue to influence political debate to this day.</p><p>Le Chapelier's early life was marked by tragedies, as he lost his father at a young age and his mother when he was only 18. Despite this, he persevered and went on to become a well-respected lawyer and politician. His strong beliefs in individual liberty and democracy earned him widespread acclaim, and his role in drafting the Le Chapelier Law cemented his place in history.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Le Chapelier was also an accomplished writer and published several works on law and politics. He was a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques and was widely respected for his intellectual prowess.</p><p>Although his life was tragically cut short, Le Chapelier has left a lasting mark on French history and politics. His legacy reminds us of the importance of protecting individual freedoms while also considering the needs of the greater community.</p><p></p><p>

(December 17, 1830		Paris-June 20, 1870)

	
		a.k.a. Jules Alfred Huot de Goncourt

	
was
a French
novelist.


					</p><p>Along with his brother, Edmond de Goncourt, Jules de Goncourt co-wrote several novels under the pen name "Goncourt". The brothers are known for pioneering the naturalist style of writing in France and for establishing the Goncourt Academy, a literary society that awards an annual prize for French literature. Jules also had a passion for collecting and wrote extensively on art and furniture. He and his brother amassed a large collection of 18th-century French furniture, which was bequeathed to the French government and can now be seen in the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. Jules de Goncourt died at the age of 39 from complications related to syphilis.</p><p>Before writing fiction, Jules de Goncourt pursued a career as an art critic and journalist. He authored several books on art and aesthetics, including "L'Art du XVIIIe siècle" (The Art of the 18th Century) and "Gavarni, l'homme et l'oeuvre" (Gavarni, the Man and His Work). In addition to his literary and artistic pursuits, he also had a keen interest in politics, and was an active supporter of Republican and socialist causes. After his death, Edmond de Goncourt established the Prix Goncourt in his brother's honor, which has since become one of the most prestigious literary awards in France. The brothers also wrote a series of journals, collectively known as "Journal des Goncourt," which offer a detailed and candid look at French society and culture in the 19th century.</p><p>Jules de Goncourt was born in Paris to a family of wealthy textile merchants. Unlike his brother Edmond, Jules did not receive a formal education and instead was tutored at home by his mother. However, his lack of formal schooling did not hinder his literary and artistic pursuits, and he was a voracious reader and art aficionado from a young age.</p><p>In 1851, the brothers published their first novel, "En 18__," which was a thinly veiled satire of Parisian society. The novel garnered both critical acclaim and controversy, with some critics taking issue with the book's explicit language and depiction of immoral behavior.</p><p>Despite these early controversies, the brothers continued to write prolifically and gained a reputation as two of France's foremost literary figures. In addition to their novels, they also wrote several plays and contributed to a number of literary and artistic journals.</p><p>Jules' interests in art and furniture collecting also led him to become an advocate for preserving French art and culture. In addition to his own collection, he championed the preservation of historic buildings and monuments, and worked closely with the French government to establish laws protecting these treasures.</p><p>Today, Jules de Goncourt is remembered as one of the pioneers of naturalist literature and a key figure in the development of French art and aesthetics. His legacy continues through the Prix Goncourt, the Goncourt Academy, and the preservation of his and his brother's vast collection of art and furniture.</p><p></p><p>

(January 11, 1758		France-June 22, 1797			Cayenne)

	
		also known as Francois Louis Bourdon

	
was
a French
lawyer.


					</p><p>He was a member of the National Constituent Assembly during the French Revolution and served as president of the Criminal Tribunal of Paris. Bourdon also participated in the Siege of Toulon and was a key figure in the insurrection of August 10, 1792 that led to the fall of the monarchy. In addition to his activism, Bourdon was a prolific writer and penned several treatises on law and politics. He was arrested and sent to French Guiana in 1797, where he died of yellow fever just months later. Bourdon is remembered as a champion of human rights and a staunch defender of the principles of the French Revolution.</p><p>Bourdon's legal career began in 1778 when he was admitted to the Paris Bar. He quickly made a name for himself as a skillful and passionate advocate for his clients, especially commoners who had been wronged by the aristocracy. Bourdon's commitment to justice and equality led him to embrace the ideas of the Enlightenment and to become an active participant in the revolution that swept across France in 1789.</p><p>As a member of the National Constituent Assembly, Bourdon played a key role in drafting the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. He argued fiercely for the abolition of feudalism and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy based on the principles of democracy and popular sovereignty.</p><p>Despite his efforts, the revolution took a violent turn, and Bourdon became increasingly radicalized. He joined the Jacobin Club and supported the Reign of Terror, a period of fierce repression during which thousands of people were executed for their political beliefs.</p><p>In 1795, Bourdon was implicated in an alleged plot to overthrow the government and was forced to flee to Switzerland. He was eventually caught and extradited to France, where he stood trial for treason. Despite his eloquent defence, Bourdon was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p><p>In early 1797, Bourdon was transferred to French Guiana, where he was incarcerated in a notorious prison on the remote island of St Joseph. He died of yellow fever just months later, at the age of 39. His legacy, however, lives on, and he is remembered as a passionate defender of human rights and a tireless advocate for the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity.</p><p>Bourdon's contributions to law and politics in France were significant during his lifetime and continue to be recognized today. He was a prolific writer, and his treatises on law and politics continue to be studied by scholars around the world. In addition to his legal and political work, Bourdon was also an avid art collector, and he amassed a sizable collection of paintings and sculptures during his lifetime.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Bourdon's life was cut short by his exile and eventual death in French Guiana. However, his work and ideals continue to inspire new generations of activists and thinkers who champion the values of the French Revolution. Bourdon is remembered as a hero of the revolution, a passionate defender of human rights and liberty, and a tireless advocate for the principles that continue to shape modern democracies around the world.</p><p></p><p>
