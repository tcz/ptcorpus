						Sibelius is widely considered to be the most significant Finnish composer of the late Romantic and early modern period. He studied music in Helsinki and eventually moved to Berlin to further his education. He went on to compose seven symphonies, numerous tone poems, chamber music, and the world-famous Finlandia. His music was heavily influenced by the natural beauty of Finland, and he drew upon Finnish folklore and mythology for many of his compositions. Sibelius also played a prominent role in the development of Finnish national identity and was a vocal supporter of Finnish independence. In 1957, Sibelius passed away at the age of 91 in his home in Järvenpää, Finland.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=49644" title="Wikipedia article about Jean Sibelius">Jean Sibelius on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/ecuadorean-musicians-died-at-age-75.html' title='Ecuadorean musicians died at age 75'><strong>Ecuadorean musicians died at age 75</strong> List of the top 4 Ecuadorean music stars who died when they were 75</a></li><li><a href='/hungarian-musicians-died-in-heart-failure.html' title='Hungarian musicians died in Heart failure'><strong>Hungarian musicians died in Heart failure</strong> List of the top 1 Hungarian music stars who died in Heart failure</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-surgery.html' title='Famous musicians died in Surgery'><strong>Famous musicians died in Surgery</strong> List of the top 8 Famous music stars who died in Surgery</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/brazilian-musicians-died-at-age-25.html' title='Brazilian musicians died at age 25'><strong>Brazilian musicians died at age 25</strong> List of the top 3 Brazilian music stars who died when they were 25</a></li><li><a href='/american-musicians-died-at-age-40.html' title='American musicians died at age 40'><strong>American musicians died at age 40</strong> List of the top 7 American music stars who died when they were 40</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actresses-died-in-2001.html' title='Famous actresses died in 2001'><strong>Famous actresses died in 2001</strong> List of the top 50 Famous actresses who died in 2001</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
