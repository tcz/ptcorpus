(February 10, 1785		Dijon-August 21, 1836			Paris)


was
a French
physicist and engineer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on fluid mechanics, particularly his formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations which describe the motion of viscous fluids. Navier also made significant contributions to structural analysis and the theory of elasticity. He was a member of the French Academy of Sciences and received numerous awards for his contributions to science and engineering. In addition to his scientific work, Navier also served as the director of the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, a prestigious engineering school in Paris.</p><p>Navier was born into a family of lawyers and civil servants, but he showed a strong interest in mathematics and science from an early age. He attended the École Polytechnique in Paris, where he studied under the famous mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange. After completing his studies, he worked as an engineer for the French government, designing bridges and canals.</p><p>In 1826, Navier published his most important work, a paper on fluid mechanics that laid the foundations for the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are still widely used to model the behavior of fluids in a variety of applications, from weather forecasting to airplane design.</p><p>Navier's work on elasticity and structural analysis also had a significant impact on engineering. He developed a formula for calculating the stress and deflection of beams, which is still used today in the design of buildings and bridges.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Navier struggled with poor health throughout his life. He suffered from gout and other chronic illnesses, which limited his ability to work and caused him to retire from his position at the École des Ponts et Chaussées in his mid-forties. Navier died in Paris in 1836, at the age of 51.</p><p>Navier's legacy in the field of fluid mechanics lives on today as the Navier-Stokes equations continue to be studied and applied in a variety of ways. His work on elasticity and structural analysis also paved the way for further developments in the field of engineering. In recognition of his contributions to science and engineering, Navier was awarded several prestigious honors during his lifetime, including the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society's Rumford Medal. Today, his name is synonymous with the foundational equations of fluid mechanics and his work continues to inspire and inform new generations of scientists and engineers.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Edouard Manet or Manet

	
was
a French
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He was a key figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism in the world of art. Manet's work was widely criticized during his lifetime for its unconventional style, but he is now considered a pioneer of modernism in visual arts. His notable works include "Luncheon on the Grass" and "Olympia". Manet was also a friend and inspiration to many artists such as Edgar Degas and Henri Matisse. Despite facing criticism for his work, he continued to produce art until his death in 1883 at the age of 51.</p><p>Manet was born into a wealthy family in Paris and received a formal education in art, studying under some of the most renowned artists of his time. He developed a unique style that challenged traditional notions of art and incorporated everyday subjects such as cafes, bars, and contemporary fashion into his paintings. Manet's work also portrayed the social and political climate of his time and he often used his art to comment on these issues.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to the art world, Manet was an important figure in the Parisian cultural scene. He was well-known for his wit and charm, and he often entertained his fellow artists and intellectuals at his home. Manet maintained close friendships with many writers and poets of his time, including Charles Baudelaire and Stéphane Mallarmé.</p><p>Despite the initial criticism he faced, Manet's legacy has had a long-lasting impact on the art world. His innovative style and emphasis on contemporary life paved the way for future generations of artists, inspiring movements such as impressionism, symbolism, and modernism. Today, Manet is considered one of the greatest artists of the 19th century and his works are featured in major museums around the world.</p><p>Manet suffered from poor health for most of his adult life, often aggravating his condition with heavy drinking and smoking. In 1868, he was diagnosed with syphilis, which would ultimately lead to his early death at the age of 51. Despite his failing health, Manet continued to produce art until the end of his life, and even completed some of his most famous works while bedridden.</p><p>Even after his death, Manet's work continued to influence and inspire other artists. His impact can be seen in the work of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, and art historians credit him with helping to pave the way for modernism in the visual arts.</p><p>In addition to his paintings, Manet was also an accomplished printmaker, producing a number of etchings and lithographs throughout his career. He was also an avid collector of art, amassing a collection of works by other artists that included paintings by Goya, Velázquez, and Delacroix.</p><p>Today, Manet is regarded as one of the most important figures in the development of modern art, and his paintings continue to be celebrated for their innovative style and subject matter.</p><p></p><p>

a French
writer, novelist and playwright.

He wrote over 90 novels, plays and short stories during his career, exploring themes such as crime, love, passion, ambition, and the complexities of human nature. Balzac's writing style was characterized by his attention to detail and his ability to create realistic, vivid characters, often drawn from his own experiences and the people he encountered in Parisian society. Despite struggling with debt and failing health throughout his life, Balzac continued to produce an extraordinary body of work that has had a lasting impact on literature and culture. Today, he is recognized as one of the most important and influential writers of the 19th century.</p><p>Balzac was born into a family of modest means and received little formal education. In his early years, he worked as a law clerk and pursued a brief career in business, which ended in failure. He then turned to writing, producing his first novel at the age of 22. Despite initial success, his financial situation remained precarious, and he spent much of his life in debt.</p><p>Balzac's literary output was prodigious, and he often worked long hours, fueled by large amounts of coffee. He is said to have written for up to 16 hours a day, sometimes without sleep for days on end. His devotion to his craft and his determination to capture the complexities of human experience led him to create some of the most memorable characters in literature, including Rastignac, Eugénie Grandet, and Colonel Chabert.</p><p>In addition to his creative pursuits, Balzac was also an astute observer of society and politics. He was deeply interested in the political and social changes of his time, and his writing reflects his engagement with the events and issues of the day.</p><p>Balzac's influence on literature has been profound, and his work continues to be read and analyzed by scholars and enthusiasts around the world. He has been called the father of the modern novel, and his impact on the development of realism and naturalism in literature cannot be overstated.</p><p>Balzac's personal life was just as complex as the characters he created. He had numerous love affairs throughout his life, including a long-term relationship with the Polish countess Ewelina Hańska, whom he eventually married late in life. Balzac's health also suffered as a result of his intense writing schedule and unhealthy habits, and he died at the age of 51 from heart failure. Despite his short life, Balzac left behind a lasting legacy that continues to inspire and entertain readers today.</p><p></p><p>

					</p><p>Kiki de Montparnasse was notable for being a muse to a number of influential artists in the Montparnasse artistic community in Paris in the 1920s, including Man Ray, Tsuguharu Foujita and Pablo Picasso. She was a popular model for both photography and painting, and her striking looks and adventurous lifestyle made her a well-known figure in the bohemian circle of artists, writers and intellectuals that frequented the cafes of Montparnasse. Kiki herself was also a creative force, producing her own paintings, poetry and music, and later in life she wrote an autobiography that provided a fascinating window into the vibrant cultural scene of early 20th-century Paris. Despite her talents and accomplishments, however, Kiki's life was marked by personal struggles with addiction and poverty, and she died at the relatively young age of 51. Nevertheless, her legacy as a symbol of freedom and self-expression lives on in the numerous works of art she inspired and the memories of those who knew and loved her.</p><p>Kiki de Montparnasse was born Alice Prin in a small town in Burgundy. At 14, she moved to Paris and worked various jobs, including posing nude for artists. She gained fame as a model due to her striking and unconventional looks, with her short hair, heavy makeup, and androgynous style. She also gained a reputation for her witty and irreverent personality, which made her a beloved figure in the Parisian avant-garde.</p><p>Kiki's relationship with Man Ray was one of the most significant of her life, both personally and artistically. He photographed her extensively, and she appeared in many of his iconic surrealist works. She also modeled for other artists, including Foujita and Moise Kisling, and had affairs with several notable figures, including the publisher Jean Groult and the writer Ernest Hemingway.</p><p>Despite her success as a model and muse, Kiki aspired to be a creative force in her own right. She began painting in the 1920s and had several exhibitions of her work. She also recorded songs and performed in cabarets, where she was known for her lively and bawdy performances. In the 1930s, she wrote an autobiography, "Kiki's Memoirs," which chronicled her tumultuous life and relationships with artists and intellectuals.</p><p>Sadly, Kiki's personal demons caught up with her in her later years. She struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction throughout her life and died of complications related to substance abuse in 1953. Nevertheless, her legacy as a muse, artist, and free spirit endures, and she remains an enduring symbol of the bohemian culture of 1920s Paris.</p><p>Despite Kiki's struggles with addiction and poverty, she continued to inspire artists and writers long after her death. In 2012, an exhibition in Paris titled "Kiki de Montparnasse: Muse, Model, & Rebel" showcased the vibrant cultural scene of Montparnasse in the 1920s and celebrated Kiki's contributions to the art world. Her autobiography, "Kiki's Memoirs," remains a valuable firsthand account of the era, offering insight into the lives and works of artists and intellectuals like Man Ray, Hemingway, and Foujita. Today, Kiki's image continues to grace posters and advertisements, her striking looks and fearless spirit embodying the spirit of the Jazz Age in Paris.</p><p></p><p>
