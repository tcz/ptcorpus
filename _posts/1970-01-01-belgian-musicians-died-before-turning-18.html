Today, his works can be found in collections around the world, including the Louvre Museum in Paris, the British Museum in London, and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.</p><p>Pontius was born into a family of artists, and his father was a well-known woodcarver. He began his career as an apprentice to the Flemish painter Simon de Pape, who was based in Antwerp. After completing his training, Pontius entered the workshop of Peter Paul Rubens, where he worked for several years. During this time, he became skilled in the techniques of oil painting, printmaking, and drawing.</p><p>Pontius was a prolific artist throughout his career, producing a large number of paintings, prints, and drawings that are now considered masterpieces of the Baroque era. His prints, in particular, are highly prized for their exceptional quality and beauty. He was closely associated with the Antwerp school of artists, which included some of the most famous names of the time, such as Anthony van Dyck and Jacob Jordaens.</p><p>After leaving Rubens' workshop, Pontius set up his own printmaking workshop in Antwerp. Here, he produced a wide range of prints and drawings that were sold throughout Europe. He was also commissioned by a number of wealthy patrons to produce portraits and other works of art, which helped establish him as one of the leading artists of his time.</p><p>Today, Paulus Pontius is recognized as one of the most important figures of the Baroque era in Belgium. His works continue to inspire and fascinate art lovers around the world, and his legacy lives on through the many museums and galleries that display his works.</p><p>Despite the fact that Paulus Pontius is celebrated for his artistic skills, it is believed that he faced some criticism during his career. Some art historians have suggested that his style was not entirely original but instead was heavily influenced by his teacher, Peter Paul Rubens. Nonetheless, Paulus Pontius still managed to carve out a niche for himself in the crowded field of 17th-century art. His works are admired for their technical brilliance and the way they capture the spirit of the time. One of his most famous works is a portrait of the Flemish painter and diplomat Anthony van Dyck, which is now in the collection of the Louvre Museum. Today, Paulus Pontius is remembered as a master of his craft and a true icon of Belgian art history.</p><p></p><p>

					</p><p>Levinus Hulsius was a Belgian personality, born in Brussels in 1546. He was a publisher and engraver, and is best known for his work publishing and editing travel narratives, including those of Marco Polo and Sir Francis Drake. Hulsius is also known for his collection of maps and his contributions to the development of the copperplate engraving technique. He played an important role in the dissemination of knowledge and travel literature throughout Europe during the Renaissance period. Hulsius died in Frankfurt in 1606.</p><p>In addition to his work as a publisher and engraver, Levinus Hulsius was also an author and historian. He wrote several books on European geography, including "Germaniae tabulae geographicae" and "Belgium sive Inferior Germania". Hulsius was also a skilled cartographer and produced several maps of Europe and the Americas. He was a member of a group of cartographers and geographers known as the "Cosmographers of the Low Countries" who were important figures in the development of geographical knowledge during the 16th century. Hulsius' contributions to this field and his role in the dissemination of knowledge have become an important part of the history of European exploration and cartography.</p><p>Hulsius was known for his meticulous attention to detail and the high quality of his publications. He was respected by his peers and often collaborated with other famous publishers of his time, such as Gerard Mercator and Jodocus Hondius. Hulsius' work had a significant impact on the cultural and intellectual landscape of Europe during the Renaissance period, as it allowed for the widespread dissemination of information about new and exotic lands.</p><p>After Hulsius' death, his publishing company was taken over by his son-in-law, Johann Baptist Hering, who continued to publish and distribute Hulsius' works.

(July 24, 1833		Royal Palace of Laeken-May 16, 1834			Royal Palace of Laeken)


was
a Belgian
personality.


					</p><p>Louis Philippe was the eldest son of King Leopold I of Belgium and Queen Louise Marie. He was born in the Royal Palace of Laeken and was named after the French King Louis Philippe I, who was his godfather. </p><p>Despite being only a year old, Louis Philippe was given the title of Crown Prince of Belgium by his father. Unfortunately, he passed away at the age of 10 months due to an inflammation of the mucous membranes. His death was a great tragedy for the royal family and the people of Belgium.</p><p>Although he didn't have a chance to leave a lasting impact, the memory of Louis Philippe lives on through various monuments and places named after him. For example, the Louis Philipsplein in Brussels and the Avenue Louis Philippe in Antwerp are named after him.</p><p>In addition to these landmarks, Louis Philippe is also remembered through a collection of portraits that were made of him during his short life. These paintings, some of which are displayed in museums around the world, offer a glimpse into the life of a young prince whose potential was tragically cut short. Despite the brevity of his life, Louis Philippe's legacy endures as a reminder of the fragility of human life and the importance of cherishing every moment with loved ones.</p><p>Louis Philippe's death also had important political implications. His passing left Leopold I without a direct heir, which sparked fears of a succession crisis in Belgium. In response, Leopold I had to seek a new bride and eventually married Princess Louise of Orleans. Together they had four children, including Prince Leopold, who later became King Leopold II of Belgium. Despite this, Louis Philippe remained an important figure in Belgian history, as he was a symbol of the hopes and aspirations of a young nation in its formative years. Over time, his tragic story has become a part of Belgium's national folklore and is still remembered and celebrated today.</p><p>Louis Philippe's tragic passing had another significant consequence: it prompted the Belgian government to establish an official system of succession for the royal family. The lack of a clear line of succession had been a concern since Belgium's independence in 1830, and Louis Philippe's premature death underscored the need for a plan to avoid future crises. As a result, the Belgian parliament passed a law in 1850 that established male primogeniture as the standard for royal succession, meaning the throne would pass to the eldest son of the monarch, followed by his eldest son, and so on. This system remained in place until 1991 when it was replaced with gender-neutral primogeniture, allowing for the eldest child - regardless of gender - to inherit the throne. </p><p>Despite his short life, Louis Philippe had a significant impact on the cultural and political landscape of Belgium. His legacy as Crown Prince, however short-lived, helped to solidify the Belgian royal family's place in the country's national identity, and his memory continues to be honored and celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>

Additionally, a street in Brussels was named after him, as well as a park in Tervuren.</p><p>Furthermore, his untimely death had a significant impact on the Belgian monarchy. With Prince Leopold passing, his older sister Princess Louise became the heir to the throne, making her the first woman in line for the Belgian throne in over a century. This sparked a period of debate and controversy over whether women should be allowed to inherit the throne in Belgium, as the country lacked a specific law on the matter. Eventually, in 1991, the Belgian parliament passed a law allowing for absolute primogeniture, which allows the eldest child regardless of gender to inherit the throne. This law was retroactively applied to Princess Louise, making her the first woman in line for the throne and paving the way for her eventual ascension as Queen consort.</p><p>Although Prince Leopold did not have the opportunity to rule, his legacy still lives on. In addition to the Prince Leopold Fund and the various memorials dedicated to him, there is also the Order of Leopold II, which was established by his father in 1900 in honor of his late son. The order is awarded to individuals for their significant contributions to the welfare and reputation of Belgium. </p><p>Prince Leopold's death also had a personal impact on his family, particularly his parents. Queen Marie Henriette suffered a nervous breakdown following his death and became emotionally unstable for the rest of her life. King Leopold II was also deeply affected by his son's passing and became increasingly reclusive and obsessed with his own mortality. </p><p>Despite his short life, Prince Leopold remains an important figure in Belgian history and a symbol of a bygone era in which royalty held great power and influence. His legacy also serves as a reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing the time we have with loved ones.</p><p>Furthermore, Prince Leopold's death had a significant impact on the Belgian people, who mourned his passing and expressed their sympathy towards the royal family. His funeral was held at the Royal Chapel of Laeken and was attended by prominent figures, including members of foreign royalty. His death was also commemorated in literature and music, with several poems and pieces of music dedicated to him. One of the most famous tributes is the "Elegy for cello and orchestra" by Belgian composer Joseph Jongen, which was written in memory of Prince Leopold. The piece was first performed at the Brussels Conservatory in 1912 and has since become a beloved classic in Belgian music.</p><p>Despite his short life, Prince Leopold's influence on Belgian history and culture continues to be felt. His legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of family, education, and scientific progress, values that were important to him during his brief time on earth. Today, he remains a beloved figure in Belgian history, and his memory is honored in numerous ways, from street names and parks to scientific research and cultural artifacts.</p><p></p><p>

His work on decimal fractions and the use of the decimal point was groundbreaking, and it helped to revolutionize mathematics and science.</p><p>Stevin also made important contributions to the field of physics. His work on hydrostatics led him to develop the principle of equilibrium of fluids, which explains how fluids behave when they are at rest. This principle has important applications in engineering and science, and it remains an important part of our understanding of the natural world.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Stevin was also an accomplished linguist and writer. He was fluent in several languages, including Dutch, French, and Latin, and he used his skills to help promote Dutch as a language of science and culture. He wrote extensively on a wide range of topics, including geometry, astronomy, and cartography, and his works remain influential to this day.</p><p>Today, Stevin is remembered as one of the most important scientific thinkers of his time.

Additionally, his life and work have been commemorated with statues and monuments in several cities in Belgium and the Netherlands.</p><p>One of Simon Stevin's notable contributions to engineering was his invention and improvement of windmills. He realized that the traditional vertical axis windmills were inefficient and difficult to maintain, so he designed the "Post Mill" - a windmill that could be turned to face the wind, increasing its efficiency. He also pioneered the use of gears and the "worm-and-wheel" system in windmills, which made them even more productive. His improvements to windmill technology were instrumental in the success of the Dutch economy, which relied heavily on these machines to power industries like grain processing and water management.</p><p>Stevin's impact on the Dutch language was also significant. He strongly advocated for the use of Dutch as a language of science and mathematics, and his efforts helped establish a standard vocabulary for these fields in Dutch. He also wrote several works in Dutch, including pamphlets and textbooks, which helped to legitimize the language as a vehicle for serious discourse. Stevin believed that a strong Dutch language was essential for the independence and prosperity of the Dutch Republic, and his legacy in this area is still celebrated today.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Stevin faced significant challenges and opposition during his lifetime. As a Protestant in a predominately Catholic country, he was often excluded from academic and professional circles. He also struggled with financial difficulties, and he was forced to sell his inventions and seek patronage to support himself. Nevertheless, he persisted in his work and made lasting contributions to the fields of science, engineering, and language. Stevin's perseverance and dedication continue to inspire people around the globe to this day.</p><p></p><p>
