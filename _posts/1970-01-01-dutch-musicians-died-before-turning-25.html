(September 17, 1764		Groningen-April 20, 1786			York)


was
a Dutch
astronomer.


					</p><p>Despite suffering from profound deafness, John Goodricke made significant discoveries in the field of astronomy. He is best known for his work on variable stars, which are stars that experience periods of brightness and dimness. Goodricke studied the eclipsing binary star Algol and was able to deduce that its brightness was due to one star passing in front of the other. He also discovered the periodic nature of the star Delta Cephei, which led to the measurement of astronomical distances using a method known as the cosmic distance ladder. Although he died at the young age of 21, John Goodricke's contributions to astronomy helped lay the foundation for future discoveries in the field.</p><p>Goodricke was born into an affluent family and received a private education at home. As a child, he contracted scarlet fever, which left him deaf. Despite this, he excelled in mathematics and science, developing a keen interest in astronomy from a young age. </p><p>In 1781, he became the first person to propose a mechanism for eclipsing binary stars, which was later confirmed by subsequent observations. In his short but productive career, Goodricke also made significant contributions to the study of the Pleiades star cluster, determining the age of the cluster and identifying several variable stars within it.</p><p>Goodricke was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his contributions to astronomy. He maintained correspondence with other leading astronomers of his time and was widely respected for his work. Today, the John Goodricke Memorial Prize is awarded annually by the British Astronomical Association to recognize outstanding contributions to the observation or study of variable stars.</p><p>In addition to his work in astronomy, John Goodricke was also an accomplished linguist and was fluent in several languages, including French, German, Italian, and Spanish. He was also known for his love of music and played several instruments, including the flute and the piano. Goodricke's scientific achievements were cut short when he contracted pneumonia and died at the age of 21. However, his legacy continues to inspire generations of astronomers who continue to build upon his work and make new discoveries in the field of variable stars. Today, Goodricke's name is remembered in several astronomical terms, including the Goodricke-Pigott Observatory and the Goodricke method for calculating the brightness of stars. Despite his short life, John Goodricke made a significant impact on astronomy and his contributions continue to shape our understanding of the universe.</p><p></p><p>
