						Rory Gallagher was born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, Ireland, and was raised in Cork. He began playing guitar at a young age and taught himself to play a variety of instruments, including the mandolin, harmonica, and saxophone. In the early 1960s, Gallagher formed his first band, The Fontana Showband, which played popular music and covers. But it wasn't until he formed a blues trio, Taste, in 1966 that he began to gain recognition as a musician. The band toured extensively throughout the UK and Ireland and released several albums before disbanding in 1970.</p><p>After Taste, Gallagher embarked on a successful solo career, releasing numerous albums and touring widely throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He was known for his passionate and energetic live performances, often playing for hours on end without pause. Despite his success and acclaim, Gallagher remained humble and dedicated to his craft, always putting the music first.</p><p>Gallagher's influence on the blues and rock genres is widely recognized, and he has been cited as an inspiration by many musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Slash. He died in 1995 at the age of 47 from complications following a liver transplant. Gallagher's legacy continues to inspire new generations of musicians to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=316151" title="Wikipedia article about Rory Gallagher">Rory Gallagher on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/dutch-musicians-died-at-age-49.html' title='Dutch musicians died at age 49'><strong>Dutch musicians died at age 49</strong> List of the top 7 Dutch music stars who died when they were 49</a></li><li><a href='/british-musicians-born-in-1994.html' title='British musicians born in 1994'><strong>British musicians born in 1994</strong> List of the top 7 British  music stars who died in who were born in 1994</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-actors-died-at-age-24.html' title='Canadian actors died at age 24'><strong>Canadian actors died at age 24</strong> List of the top 1 Canadian actors who died when they were 24</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/georgian-musicians-died-at-age-50.html' title='Georgian musicians died at age 50'><strong>Georgian musicians died at age 50</strong> List of the top 1 Georgian music stars who died when they were 50</a></li><li><a href='/english-musicians-died-in-renal-cell-carcinoma.html' title='English musicians died in Renal cell carcinoma'><strong>English musicians died in Renal cell carcinoma</strong> List of the top 1 English music stars who died in Renal cell carcinoma</a></li><li><a href='/south-korean-musicians-died-in-myocardial-infarction.html' title='South Korean musicians died in Myocardial infarction'><strong>South Korean musicians died in Myocardial infarction</strong> List of the top 1 South Korean music stars who died in Myocardial infarction</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
