					</p><p>Lawrence was born in Bristol to a family of merchants. He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and then went on to study law at University College, London.

His first book, published in 1855, was a novel called "Sans Merci," which was a critical success.</p><p>Over the next twenty years, Lawrence published more than twenty novels, including "Brakespeare", which became one of his most famous works. He also wrote several non-fiction books on subjects such as law and politics. During his career, Lawrence became well-known for his vivid, atmospheric writing style and his ability to create complex, multi-dimensional characters.</p><p>In addition to his writing career, Lawrence was also involved in politics. He was a member of the Liberal Party and worked as a lobbyist for various causes, including the abolition of the death penalty.
