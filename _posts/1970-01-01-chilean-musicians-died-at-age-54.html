						</p><p>Vicente Huidobro was one of the most prominent figures of the Latin American avant-garde movement known as Creacionismo. His work was highly experimental and often challenged traditional forms of expression. He founded and edited numerous literary magazines, including "Cervantes" and "Nord-Sud", which contributed greatly to the dissemination of modernist literature in the Spanish-speaking world.</p><p>Huidobro spent much of his life traveling between Europe and Latin America, and his work was greatly influenced by the literary and artistic movements he encountered along the way. He associated with major avant-garde figures such as Pablo Picasso and Guillaume Apollinaire and even wrote a manifesto proposing a new global movement in art and literature called "Superrealism," which anticipated many of the key features of Surrealism.</p><p>Despite his prolific career, Huidobro's life was not without tragedy. His first wife, Ximena Amunátegui, died in a plane crash while returning to Chile in 1938. Huidobro subsequently suffered a nervous breakdown and was forced to return to Chile, where he settled in the coastal town of Cartagena. He died there in 1948, not long before his 55th birthday. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important and influential Latin American poets of the 20th century.</p><p></p><p>
