									</h1><p>Here are 13 famous musicians from Canada died at 58:</p><h2>Harold Innis</h2><p><strong>Harold Innis</strong>
(November 5, 1894		Otterville, Ontario-November 8, 1952			Toronto)


was
a Canadian
economist and philosopher.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the founders of the communication theory and the father of Canadian economic history. Innis studied at the University of Oxford and the University of Chicago, and later became a professor at the University of Toronto, where he taught for over thirty years.</p><p>Innis is famous for his approach to the study of communication, which he referred to as "the study of media". He believed that media technologies - such as writing, printing, and electronic media - played a crucial role in shaping human culture and society.</p><p>Innis also made significant contributions to the field of economic history, particularly Canadian economic history. His research focused on the role of staple products, such as fur and timber, in the development of the Canadian economy. His work helped to shift the focus of economic historians from Europe to North America.</p><p>Innis was a prolific writer, and his books and articles continue to be influential in several fields, including communication studies, economic history, and Canadian studies. He was awarded several honours during his lifetime, including the Order of Canada.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to communication theory and Canadian economic history, Harold Innis also played an active role in public life. During World War II, he served as an advisor to the Canadian government on economic and communication policies. He was also involved in politics, and ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (a socialist party) in the 1940 and 1945 federal elections in Canada. </p><p>Innis's legacy continues to influence scholars and thinkers in various disciplines. In particular, his emphasis on the role of media in shaping human society has resonated with contemporary scholars who study the impact of digital technologies on culture and communication. In recognition of his contributions to Canadian intellectual life, the Harold Innis Centenary Conference was held at the University of Toronto in 1994.</p><p>Innis's seminal work, "The Bias of Communication," published in 1951, was one of the earliest works in media ecology, a field that explores the relationships between communication technologies, media, and human culture. He argued that each medium of communication has its own unique biases, which shape how information is disseminated and received. For example, he argued that the printing press prioritized rationality and abstract thought, while oral cultures were better suited for the sharing of traditional knowledge and cultural values. </p><p>Innis was also a strong advocate for Canadian cultural independence, arguing that Canadian culture and identity were threatened by the dominant cultural influence of the United States. He believed that Canada needed to develop its own media infrastructure and industries to preserve its distinctiveness.</p><p>Innis's work has been used to critique contemporary media and communication technologies, particularly the internet and social media. Some scholars have argued that the biases of these technologies prioritize speed, fragmentation, and immediacy, which can have negative effects on our ability to engage in deep, reflective thought and meaningful communication. </p><p>Overall, Harold Innis's contributions to the study of communication and economic history continue to shape our understanding of these fields today. His interdisciplinary approach, which brought together economics, philosophy, and media studies, remains influential across many academic disciplines.</p><p></p><p>

(August 28, 1921		London-September 28, 1979)


was
a Canadian
physicist.


					</p><p>Chapman was a leading research scientist specializing in aeronomy, the study of the Earth's upper atmosphere. He made significant contributions to our understanding of the ionosphere, the region of the Earth's atmosphere that includes the electrically charged layer used for radio communication. Chapman's work also helped explain the behavior of gases in the upper atmosphere, including the formation of the ozone layer.</p><p>Chapman received his PhD from Cambridge University in 1945 and went on to work at various institutions in the UK, Canada, and the US. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1954 and received numerous other awards and honors throughout his career. Chapman was also an avid outdoorsman and mountaineer, and he died tragically in a climbing accident in the Swiss Alps in 1979.</p><p>Chapman's groundbreaking work on the theory of the formation of the ozone layer was published in a series of papers in the 1950s, and it is still widely cited today. His work helped explain how ozone forms in the upper atmosphere and how it is destroyed by pollutants such as chlorofluorocarbons. Chapman also studied the Earth's magnetic field and the effects of solar activity on the atmosphere.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Chapman was known for his commitment to public service. He served as president of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics and was a member of several national and international scientific committees. Chapman was also a strong advocate for science education and outreach, and he was involved in several programs to increase public understanding of science.</p><p>Chapman's legacy continues to this day through the many scientists he mentored and inspired during his career. The John H. Chapman Award, given by the Canadian Space Agency, is named in his honor and recognizes outstanding achievements in the fields of space science and technology.</p><p>Chapman's work was instrumental in the development of space exploration and research. He was one of the first scientists to recognize the importance of studying the Earth's upper atmosphere in order to understand the impact of solar radiation and other space-related phenomena. Chapman also played a key role in the development of the Canadian space program, serving as the first director of the Defence Research Telecommunications Establishment (DRTE) in Ottawa. Under his leadership, the DRTE became a world leader in satellite communication research and development.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Chapman was known for his modesty and dedication to his work. He remained committed to advancing the field of aeronomy throughout his life, and his contributions continue to shape our understanding of the Earth's atmosphere today. Chapman's work on the ozone layer, in particular, has had a profound impact on global efforts to protect the environment and combat climate change.</p><p></p><p>

(August 10, 1865		Montreal-January 23, 1924)


was
a Canadian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a significant figure in the history of Canadian art, known for his contributions to the Post-Impressionist movement. Morrice spent much of his life traveling and painting en plein air, capturing the landscapes and cityscapes of Europe, North Africa, and the Caribbean. Despite his extensive travels, Morrice maintained close ties to the Montreal art community and was heavily involved in the founding of the Canadian Art Club. Throughout his career, he was recognized for his distinct use of color and light, which brought a uniquely Canadian perspective to the Post-Impressionist style. Today, Morrice's works can be found in major collections around the world, including the National Gallery of Canada and the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.</p><p>Morrice was born in Montreal in 1865, into a wealthy and influential family. Despite his privileged upbringing, he showed an early interest in art and began studying at the Académie Julian in Paris in 1890, where he was exposed to the work of Post-Impressionist painters such as Paul Cézanne and Vincent van Gogh. This experience had a profound impact on Morrice's own style, which became characterized by loose brushwork, vibrant colors, and a strong sense of atmospheric effect.</p><p>Throughout his career, Morrice maintained a nomadic lifestyle, spending much of his time traveling to different parts of the world in search of inspiration. He was particularly drawn to the warmer climates of the Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Caribbean, where he found a wealth of new motifs to explore. He was also an avid collector of Asian art, which heavily influenced his own compositions.</p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Morrice's impact on Canadian art was significant. He was one of the founding members of the Canadian Art Club and played a key role in promoting modernist styles in Canada. Today, his paintings are highly sought after by collectors and art enthusiasts around the world, and are renowned for their vivid colors and lively brushwork.</p><p>In addition to his artistic career, Morrice was also an accomplished writer and published several works throughout his lifetime. He wrote extensively about his travels and experiences, often incorporating his love of literature and poetry into his writing. Many of his writings were published in literary journals and magazines of the time, and are still studied today for their insights into Morrice's creative process and motivations.</p><p>Despite his success as an artist and writer, Morrice faced several setbacks and challenges throughout his life. He struggled with alcoholism and financial difficulties, and his health began to decline in his later years. He ultimately passed away in 1924 at the age of 58.</p><p>Despite these difficulties, Morrice's legacy as a pioneering figure in Canadian art has endured. His innovative use of color and light helped to redefine the Canadian landscape tradition, and his travels and experiences abroad brought an international perspective to Canadian art. Today, he is remembered as one of Canada's most influential artists and a leading figure in the Post-Impressionist movement.</p><p></p><p>
