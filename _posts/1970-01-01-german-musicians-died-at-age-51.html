		also known as Philipp Jaffe

	
was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Philipp Jaffé was a prominent German lawyer, political activist and publisher during the 19th century. He was a key figure in the liberal movement and fought for civil rights and freedom of the press. Jaffé founded the liberal newspaper "Berliner Tageblatt" in 1872, which quickly became one of the most influential papers in Germany. He was also a member of the Prussian parliament and served as a judge in Berlin. However, Jaffé's life took a tragic turn in 1870 when he was accused of accepting bribes. Feeling the weight of the accusations and unable to bear the public disgrace, Jaffé took his own life. Despite this tragic end, his contributions to German liberalism and journalism continue to be remembered and celebrated today.</p><p>In addition to his work as a lawyer, publisher, and political activist, Philipp Jaffé was also a prolific writer. He authored numerous legal treatises and was an expert in the field of civil law. Jaffé was also a passionate advocate for Jewish rights and worked to combat anti-Semitism in Germany. He was involved in founding the German Jewish congregation and served on its board of directors for a time. Jaffé was highly respected by his contemporaries and his death was mourned by many. Despite the scandal that surrounded his final days, he is remembered today as a champion of civil liberties and a tireless advocate for freedom of the press.</p><p>Philipp Jaffé's early life was marked by tragedy, as he lost his parents at a young age and was forced to earn a living as a tutor. However, this did not deter him from pursuing his education and he ultimately went on to study law at the University of Leipzig. After completing his studies, Jaffé entered into private legal practice and quickly gained a reputation as a skilled and principled lawyer.</p><p>Jaffé's political career began in the 1840s, when he became involved in the liberal movement in Germany. He was a strong advocate for constitutional reform and worked tirelessly to promote the principles of democracy and individual rights. Jaffé was sympathetic to the plight of workers and was one of the first politicians in Germany to call for the establishment of labor unions.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Jaffé's legacy was tarnished by the scandal that engulfed him in the final years of his life. He was accused of accepting bribes in connection with his work as a judge, and the resulting public outcry was too much for him to bear. However, Jaffé's contributions to the cause of liberalism cannot be understated, and his impact on German politics and journalism continues to be felt today.</p><p></p><p>

(October 30, 1893		Celle-February 3, 1945			Berlin)

	
		a.k.a. Judge Roland Freisler

	
was
a German
judge and lawyer.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Roland Freisler and Harald Freisler.

						</p><p>Freisler was a key figure in the Nazi regime, serving as the President of the People's Court from 1942 until his death in 1945. He was known for his vicious and biased judgments against opponents of the Nazi regime, earning him the nickname "the Blood Judge". Freisler was a vocal supporter of Hitler and the Nazi Party, and played a role in the persecution and sentencing of thousands of people, including members of the resistance movement, political dissidents, and Jews. He was killed during an Allied bombing raid on Berlin in 1945. Despite his infamous legacy, his sons both went on to have successful careers in law and politics, distancing themselves from their father's extremism.</p><p>Before his involvement with the Nazi party, Freisler was a successful lawyer and legal scholar. He served as a judge in various courts, including the People's Court of Berlin, and was known for his aggressive and confrontational style in the courtroom. He was also a published author, writing on topics such as legal theory and criminal law.</p><p>During his time as President of the People's Court, Freisler oversaw some of the most notorious trials of the Nazi era, including the trial of the White Rose resistance group and the trial of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators for their unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler. Freisler's lack of impartiality and his tendency to shout down defendants and witnesses made a mockery of the idea of a fair trial.</p><p>After his death, Freisler's image remained a symbol of the injustices of the Nazi era, and he was often cited as an example of the dangers of allowing political ideology to override the principles of justice and human rights. His sons, in contrast, pursued careers in law and politics that embodied those principles.</p><p>Freisler's elder son, Roland Freisler, Jr., became a judge and worked to distance himself from his father's legacy. He was a founding member of the German Association of Judges and served as the chairman of the Berlin district court. Later, he also played a major role in helping to rebuild the German judicial system after World War II. Harald Freisler, on the other hand, pursued a career in politics and served as a member of the Bundestag, the German parliament, for several years. He was a member of the Social Democratic Party and was known for his vocal opposition to far-right extremism. Both of Freisler's sons worked to ensure that the atrocities of the Nazi era would never be repeated and that justice would always remain a fundamental principle of the law. Despite their father's infamous legacy, they both chose to use their legal training and expertise to serve the cause of justice and human rights.</p><p></p><p>

a German
personality.


					</p><p>Krüger was a prominent Nazi and a high-ranking member of the SS. He served as the SS and Police Leader for the General Government in Poland during the Second World War. Krüger played a significant role in the implementation of the Final Solution, the Nazi regime's plan to systematically exterminate the Jewish population of Europe. He was responsible for overseeing the construction of concentration and extermination camps, as well as the deportation of Jews to these camps. Krüger was known for his brutality and ruthlessness towards those under his command. Despite being indicted for war crimes after the war, Krüger ultimately took his own life before he could face justice.</p><p>Before joining the Nazi party, Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger had a military career, serving in World War I and later in the Freikorps. He became a member of the Nazi party in 1929 and quickly rose through the ranks of the SS. In 1939, he was appointed SS and Police Leader in the General Government, the territory of Poland that was occupied and administered by Nazi Germany. </p><p>Krüger was instrumental in the establishment of the Warsaw Ghetto, which confined hundreds of thousands of Jews in squalid conditions. He personally oversaw the deportations of Jews to concentration camps and ordered the execution of thousands of Jews in the streets of Warsaw. Krüger also played a key role in the construction of the Treblinka extermination camp, where over 800,000 Jews were killed.</p><p>After the war, Krüger was indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He went into hiding but was eventually captured by British forces. Krüger committed suicide in his cell before he could be brought to trial.</p><p>Krüger was known for his unwavering loyalty to the Nazi party and Adolf Hitler. He was also infamous for his disdain for the Polish people, whom he viewed as subhuman. Krüger was responsible for the widespread terror and violence that prevailed in Poland during Nazi occupation. Under his leadership, Polish citizens were subjected to mass executions, forced labor, and other forms of brutal repression.</p><p>Despite his crimes, Krüger was admired by some members of the Nazi party, who viewed him as a ruthless and effective leader. His death was seen as a tragic loss by many of his former colleagues in the SS.</p><p>Today, Krüger's legacy remains a controversial topic in Germany and elsewhere. While some view him as a monster who committed horrific atrocities, others see him as a victim of circumstances who was simply following orders. However, his role in the genocide of the Jewish people and the brutal occupation of Poland make him one of the most notorious figures of the Nazi regime.</p><p></p><p>

Despite his contributions to science, Marius' legacy has been somewhat overshadowed by the disputes over his claim to the discovery of the moons of Jupiter.</p><p>Marius was born into a wealthy family and received an excellent education. He studied at the University of Padua, where he was greatly influenced by the works of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler. Marius returned to Germany in 1601 and took up a position as a court mathematician in Ansbach.

He was the first to observe the Andromeda Galaxy and to suggest that it was a separate galaxy from the Milky Way. He also made important observations of the phases of Venus and of the rings of Saturn. Marius' work helped to lay the foundation for the modern study of astronomy.</p><p>In addition to his accomplishments in astronomy, Simon Marius was also known for his expertise in mathematics. He authored several mathematical treatises, including "Mathematical Treatise on the Planets," in which he described his method for calculating planetary orbits using Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Marius also made significant contributions to the field of medicine, serving as a court physician in Ansbach and publishing a medical textbook titled "The Practice of Medicine."

		one
		child,
		Jacob Denner.

						</p><p>Johann Christoph Denner was a famous maker of musical instruments, especially woodwind instruments such as the clarinet. He is credited with the invention of the modern clarinet, which he developed from the chalumeau. Denner's improvements to the instrument included the addition of several keys, which allowed for greater range and more complex music to be played on the clarinet. His clarinets were highly sought after and played by many famous musicians of his time. In addition to his work as an instrument maker, Denner was also a well-respected musician in his own right, known for his exquisite playing on the flute and other instruments. His legacy lives on today in the continued popularity and widespread use of the clarinet in classical and jazz music.</p><p>Johann Christoph Denner came from a family of instrument makers, which likely influenced his interest in the field. He worked closely with his father to learn the trade and eventually took over the family workshop. In addition to the clarinet, Denner also made other woodwind instruments such as the oboe and bassoon.</p><p>Denner's contributions to the clarinet revolutionized the instrument and helped establish it as a staple of classical music. His developments in key design and construction methods served as a foundation for later clarinet makers to build upon. Denner's craftsmanship and attention to detail also contributed to the quality of his instruments, which were known for their superior sound and playability.</p><p>Although Denner's life was relatively short, his impact was significant. His innovations in instrument making and his skill as a musician helped shape the course of musical history. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures in the development of the clarinet and a pioneer in the field of woodwind instrument making.</p><p>Denner's success as an instrument maker can also be attributed to his experimentation with materials. He experimented with different types of wood and studied the acoustics of each, eventually settling on boxwood for his clarinets. Boxwood allowed for a clear and resonant sound, which enhanced the musical qualities of the instrument. </p><p>Denner's fame as an instrument maker extended beyond his own lifetime. Many of his clarinets were exported to other countries, including England, France, and Italy. In fact, it was in France that the clarinet gained great popularity, thanks in part to the quality of the instruments made by Denner.</p><p>Today, Denner's instruments are highly prized by collectors and musicians alike. His clarinets are considered some of the finest ever produced, and are still played by professional musicians in orchestras around the world. Denner's legacy continues to inspire and influence instrument makers and musicians to this day.</p><p></p><p>
