(January 31, 1702-June 8, 1747)


was
an English
personality.


					</p><p>Correction: Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton (January 31, 1702-June 8, 1747) was an Irish politician and Lord Chancellor of Ireland. </p><p>He was born in County Cork, Ireland, and succeeded his father as the 2nd Viscount Midleton in 1728. Brodrick served as a member of the Irish House of Commons and was appointed Speaker of the House in 1733. In 1735, he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland and held the position until his death in 1747.</p><p>As Lord Chancellor, Brodrick worked to reform the Irish legal system and helped to establish the Irish Court of Exchequer. He was also a proponent of the Penal Laws, which discriminated against Irish Catholics.</p><p>Brodrick was married twice and had several children. His eldest son, George Brodrick, went on to become a prominent historian and academic.</p><p>During his time as Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, Alan Brodrick was known for his strong opposition to the government of Prime Minister Robert Walpole. He worked to limit the powers of the Irish Privy Council and supported the rights of the Irish parliament.</p><p>Brodrick was also a supporter of the arts and sciences. He was a member of the Royal Dublin Society, which promoted education, agriculture, and industry in Ireland, and he helped to establish the Dublin Society's School of Drawing and Painting. He was also a patron of the playwright George Farquhar and supported the Dublin publication of the first English translation of Don Quixote.</p><p>After his death in 1747, Brodrick was buried in Saint Anne's Church in Dublin. His estate passed to his eldest son, George, who continued his father's legacy as a public servant and supporter of the arts.</p><p>In addition to his political and cultural contributions, Alan Brodrick was also a noted scholar and writer. He was fluent in several languages and published several works, including a translation of the Latin poet Horace's Ars Poetica. He was also a member of the exclusive Scriblerus Club, a group of writers and intellectuals that included Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift. Brodrick's interests extended to science as well, and he was a member of the Royal Society in London.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Brodrick was not without controversy. In addition to his support of the Penal Laws, he was also criticized for his role in the prosecution of the notorious Irish highwayman James Freney, who was hanged in 1743. At the same time, he was known for his impartiality in his role as Lord Chancellor and his commitment to justice.</p><p>Today, Brodrick's legacy is remembered in Ireland through a number of schools, streets, and other public institutions named in his honor. He is also commemorated in the Midleton Family Gallery at the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork, which features artwork and artifacts related to his life and career.</p><p>Additionally, Alan Brodrick's contributions to Irish society were recognized through his appointment as a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1730 and his election as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1735. His legal expertise was also honored through his appointment as a bencher of the King's Inns in Dublin, a prestigious legal society.</p><p>Although he was a member of the Anglican Church, Brodrick was known for his tolerance towards other religions and supported the building of a new synagogue in Cork in 1747. He also worked to improve Ireland's infrastructure, advocating for better roads and bridges.</p><p>Brodrick's legacy, however, was tarnished by his family's involvement in the slave trade. His grandfather, Sir St. John Brodrick, was a prominent figure in the English slave trade, and the family's wealth was derived in part from this industry. This legacy has been a subject of controversy in recent years, with calls to remove Brodrick's name from public institutions and streets.</p><p>Despite this controversy, Alan Brodrick's contributions to Irish politics, law, and culture cannot be denied. He played a significant role in shaping Ireland's legal system and promoting the arts and sciences during a critical period in the country's history.</p><p></p><p>

was
a Soviet
scientist and engineer.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Astra Zander and Mercury Zander.

						</p><p>Friedrich Zander is most famous for his work on rocket launchers and space exploration. He was very interested in the possibility of interplanetary travel, and his ideas inspired the Soviet space program. Zander designed a number of rockets with advanced features, such as multiple stages for boosting the rocket into space. He also worked on developing a new type of fuel that would allow rockets to travel farther and faster. In addition to his work on rocketry, Zander was also an accomplished astronomer and designed several telescopes. He received the Order of Lenin, the highest civilian honor in the Soviet Union, for his contributions to science and engineering.</p><p>Born in Riga, Latvia, Friedrich Zander studied at the Riga Polytechnic Institute before moving to Moscow to continue his studies at the Moscow Higher Technical School. He began his career as a designer of internal combustion engines and was an active participant in the amateur rocket society in Moscow. In 1924, he founded the First State Rocket Institute (GIRD) in Moscow, which later became the basis for the Soviet space program.</p><p>Zander was a visionary thinker who believed in the possibility of exploring outer space through interplanetary travel. He designed and developed several rocket prototypes, including the GIRD-09, which was the first rocket designed by the Soviet Union to use liquid fuel. His work on rockets contributed to the development of the R-7 missile, which was the first intercontinental ballistic missile and was instrumental in launching the first satellite, Sputnik 1, and the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space.</p><p>Apart from his contribution to rocket science, Zander was also an avid astronomer and designed several astronomical instruments, including the Zander-II telescope, used for observing stars and galaxies. He was deeply committed to science education and encouraged the public's interest in space exploration.</p><p>In recognition of his work, Zander received numerous honors, including the Jawaharlal Nehru International Award for International Understanding and the Lenin Prize. Though he died at a young age of 45 due to epidemic typhus, his contributions to space exploration and rocketry continue to inspire scientists and engineers around the world.</p><p>Friedrich Zander's legacy in space exploration lives on even today with his important contributions to rocket technology, especially in the field of interplanetary space travel. His research helped shape the early Soviet space programme and paved the way for future space missions. Apart from his many other achievements, Zander was also a prolific writer, contributing several articles on rocketry and astronomy to newspapers and magazines. He was known for his unconventional thinking and fearless attitude towards experimentation, which inspired many of his contemporaries and later generations of scientists. Today, he is remembered as a pioneer of rocket technology and a visionary who dared to dream of exploring the cosmos.</p><p>Zander's legacy extended beyond rocket technology, as he was also a proponent of eugenics, a widely discredited field which focused on the practice of improving human genetics through selective breeding, sterilization of the so-called "unfit", and other methods. Zander believed that eugenics should be practiced as a means of improving the human race and increasing human potential in space exploration. He has been criticized for his views on eugenics, but his ideas were widely accepted in his time, and he remains an important figure in the history of science and technology. Despite the controversy surrounding his beliefs, there is no denying the impact that Zander had on space exploration, and his pioneering work continues to inspire scientists and engineers to this day.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Dr. Marcus Whitman

	
was
an American
physician.


					</p><p>Whitman was one of the first Protestant missionaries to travel westward to the Oregon Country. Along with his wife Narcissa, they established the Waiilatpu mission near present-day Walla Walla, Washington. Whitman's mission work was aimed at converting indigenous people, particularly the Cayuse tribe, to Christianity. He also worked to establish a medical practice in the mission, where he treated both white settlers and indigenous people. Whitman's murder, along with his wife, became a significant event in the Oregon boundary dispute, as it sparked conflicts between the U.S. and British authorities in the region. Today, Whitman is considered a controversial figure due to his involvement in the forced assimilation of indigenous peoples.</p><p>The Whitmans, along with several other settlers, also played a significant role in opening up the Oregon Trail, which allowed for the safe passage of thousands of settlers to the west. In addition to his missionary and medical work, Whitman also acted as an advisor to the U.S. government on matters related to the Oregon Country. He was a strong advocate of American settlement in the region and believed that it was important for the U.S. to establish a presence in the area before other competing powers, namely Britain, did. Despite his controversial stance on assimilating indigenous people, Whitman was seen as a hero in his time and his death was mourned by many Americans. Today, his legacy is complex and continues to be the subject of debate and discussion, particularly in the Pacific Northwest region.</p><p>Whitman's murder was carried out by members of the Cayuse tribe in 1847, who blamed him and other settlers for a measles outbreak that devastated their population. The killing of Whitman and his wife, along with several other missionaries and settlers, sparked a conflict known as the Cayuse War. The conflict was eventually resolved with the execution of several Cayuse warriors and the imprisonment of others. </p><p>Despite the controversial aspects of his legacy, Whitman played a significant role in the early history of the Pacific Northwest. He was instrumental in establishing the first permanent settlement in present-day Washington and helped to open the door for thousands of settlers moving to the region. His work as a physician and advisor to the U.S. government also contributed to the growth and development of the area. Today, there are many landmarks and institutions named in his honor, including the Marcus Whitman Hotel in Walla Walla and the Whitman College in nearby Walla Walla, Washington.</p><p>Whitman's dedication to establishing a permanent presence in the Pacific Northwest and his efforts to expand the American empire in the region earned him a lasting legacy as a key figure in American expansionism. He was also known for his contributions to medical science and his pioneering work in the use of quinine for the treatment of malaria. Whitman was a well-respected figure in his time, and his life and work continue to be the subject of study and debate. Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, he remains an influential figure in the early history of the United States and the Pacific Northwest. Today, his legacy is remembered through various institutions, landmarks, and organizations throughout the region, many of which are dedicated to improving the lives of indigenous communities and promoting cross-cultural dialogue and understanding.</p><p></p><p>
