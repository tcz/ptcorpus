a Norwegian
personality.


					</p><p>Tjostolv Moland was a former Norwegian army officer who became widely known after being arrested and imprisoned for charges of espionage and murder in the Republic of Congo.

The incident led to a highly publicized trial, which attracted attention from both Norway and the rest of the world. </p><p>Moland and French maintained their innocence throughout the trial, claiming that they were victims of a setup by the Congolese government.
