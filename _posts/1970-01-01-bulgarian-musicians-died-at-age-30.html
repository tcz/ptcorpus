personality.

Vasilev wrote poetry, essays, and novels, most notably "The Gudulka" and "The Four Fortress." He was also an accomplished translator, translating works by William Faulkner, Franz Kafka, and James Joyce into Bulgarian.

In 1966, he received the Dimitrov Prize, one of Bulgaria's highest honors for artists and intellectuals. However, his outspoken criticism of the government's cultural policies also made him a target of censorship and persecution.

(January 15, 1895		Radnevo-May 15, 1925)

	
		also known as Georgi Milev Kasabov

	
was
a Bulgarian
poet, translator and editor.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Leda Mileva.

						</p><p>Geo Milev is considered one of the most important representatives of Bulgarian avant-garde literature of the early 20th century. He was a member of the literary movement "Misal" and the artistic group "Plamuk" which sought to renew Bulgarian literature and culture. Milev's poetry was characterized by its innovative language, free verse, and strong social and political themes. He wrote about the First World War, the Bulgarian socialist movement, and the struggles of the working class. Milev was also a prolific translator and translated the works of Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and Edgar Allan Poe into Bulgarian. </p><p>Tragically, Geo Milev's life was cut short when he was executed at the age of 30 by the Bulgarian Communist government during the September Uprising in 1923. Despite his short life and career, Milev left a lasting impact on Bulgarian literature and is remembered as one of the country's most important poets.</p><p>Also worth noting is that Geo Milev studied law at Sofia University but never received his degree as he was more interested in literature. He was actively involved in politics, joining the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1920, but eventually left due to disagreements with the party's leadership. Milev's most famous work is the poem "September," which he wrote in 1924 and which was inspired by the September Uprising. He died the following year while being held as a political prisoner. In addition to his poetry and translations, Milev also worked as an editor and helped found several literary and cultural magazines, including "Plamuk" and "Modern Thought." In 1973, a monument was erected in Sofia's South Park in honor of Geo Milev, and he is still widely celebrated in Bulgaria today.</p><p></p><p>
