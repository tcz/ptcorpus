(June 16, 1313		Certaldo-December 21, 1375			Certaldo)

	
		also known as Boccaccio, Giovanni, Boccaccio Giovanni, G. Boccaccio, Boccaccio, Boccace or Boccacio

	
was
an Italian
writer, poet and author.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Francesco Boccaccio, Mario Boccaccio, Giulio Boccaccio and Violante Boccaccio.

						</p><p>Boccaccio is best known for his work "The Decameron", a collection of novellas that was written between 1349 and 1353. The book is considered a masterpiece of early Italian literature and has had a profound influence on writers throughout history. Boccaccio also wrote a number of other works, including "On Famous Women", a collection of biographies of prominent women throughout history, and "The Elegy of Lady Fiammetta", a novel about a young woman's ill-fated love affair. In addition to writing, Boccaccio was also a diplomat and a scholar, and was deeply interested in the classical world. He was a devoted student of the works of the ancient Greek and Roman writers, and his writings often drew on these traditions. Despite being born into a wealthy family, Boccaccio lived a relatively humble life, devoting himself to his writing and scholarship until his death in 1375.</p><p>Boccaccio was also heavily involved in the arts and culture of his time. He was particularly interested in the works of the humanist movement and was a close friend of the poet Petrarch. In fact, it was Petrarch who first introduced Boccaccio to the world of literature and scholarship, and the two remained close and supportive throughout their lives. In addition, Boccaccio was also involved in the Florentine literary scene, and was a member of several important literary institutions. He was particularly well-regarded as a storyteller, and his works were often performed by traveling theater troupes. Overall, Boccaccio's legacy has been enormous, and his works have had a lasting impact on Italian and European literature. His influence can be seen in works as diverse as Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" and Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet". Today, Boccaccio is widely regarded as one of the greatest Italian writers of all time, and his works continue to be studied and celebrated by scholars and readers around the world.</p><p>Boccaccio's life was not without its controversies. In his early years, he entered into an illicit affair with a woman named Maria d'Aquino, who inspired some of his later works. He also faced criticism for his frank portrayal of sexuality and his use of vulgar language in "The Decameron." However, these criticisms did little to diminish Boccaccio's reputation, and his works have continued to be admired for their wit, humor, and insight into human nature. In addition to his literary and cultural achievements, Boccaccio also played an important role in the political and social events of his time. He served as a mediator between the powerful families of Florence and was tasked with negotiating peace treaties and other diplomatic agreements. Despite these responsibilities, however, Boccaccio remained remarkably dedicated to his writing and scholarship, and his legacy as a literary giant endures to this day.</p><p>Throughout his life, Boccaccio struggled with health problems, including debilitating headaches and what is believed to have been an eye condition that eventually left him partially blind. These physical challenges only heightened his focus on intellectual pursuits, and he continued to write and create despite his difficulties. In his later years, Boccaccio became increasingly reclusive, withdrawing from social activities and spending most of his time in his library. It was during this period that he wrote his final work, "Corbaccio", a biting satire on the hypocrisy and corruption of Florentine society. Boccaccio's lasting contributions to literature and culture have earned him numerous accolades over the years, including the designation of a crater on the moon in his honor. Today, his influence continues to be felt across a wide range of disciplines, and he remains an enduring symbol of Italian literary excellence.</p><p></p><p>

(April 13, 1920		Milan-June 17, 1982			London)


was
an Italian
banker and financier.


					</p><p>Calvi was the Chairman of Banco Ambrosiano, one of the largest private banks in Italy at the time. However, in the early 1980s, the bank became embroiled in a scandal involving allegations of money laundering, illegal dealings with the Vatican Bank, and links to organized crime. Calvi was eventually arrested and tried on various charges, including fraudulent bankruptcy and illegal transfer of funds.</p><p>In June 1982, Calvi's body was found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London, leading to widespread speculation and conspiracy theories about his death. Initially ruled as a suicide, a later investigation found that Calvi had likely been murdered and that his death was connected to the financial scandal.</p><p>The case is still unsolved, and various theories suggest involvement by the Italian Mafia, the Vatican, and even British intelligence agency MI6.</p><p>Calvi was known as "God's Banker" due to his close ties with the Vatican Bank and the fact that Banco Ambrosiano was the main shareholder of Vatican Bank. The financial scandal involving Banco Ambrosiano also implicated Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, who was the head of Vatican Bank at the time. However, Marcinkus refused to cooperate with Italian authorities and was never charged with any wrongdoing.</p><p>Calvi was also a member of the secretive Masonic lodge Propaganda Due (P2), which was involved in various political and financial scandals in Italy in the 1970s and 1980s. Calvi's involvement with P2 raised further questions about his activities and who may have been connected to his death.</p><p>To this day, the circumstances surrounding Calvi's death remain a mystery, and the case has been the subject of numerous investigations and conspiracy theories.</p><p>Following Calvi's death, there were numerous investigations and trials related to the Banco Ambrosiano scandal. In 1986, several members of the mafia were convicted of Calvi's murder, but many believe that these were just low level figures and that there were larger forces at play. Over the years, different theories have emerged about who was really behind Calvi's death. An independent inquiry commissioned by Calvi's family suggested that the mafia was hired by members of the P2 to kill him. Some theories also suggest that Calvi was killed because he knew too much about the Vatican Bank's dealings with organized crime groups. Despite the fact that the investigations have not led to a conclusive resolution, the case remains one of the most intriguing financial and political scandals in recent history.</p><p>Calvi began his career in banking in the early 1940s, and quickly rose through the ranks due to his talent and skills. By the 1970s, he was a respected figure in the international financial community, and had become one of the most powerful bankers in Italy. He was known for his close ties to the Vatican, and was considered an influential figure in Italian politics at the time.</p><p>In addition to his work in finance, Calvi was also known for his philanthropy. He was a generous supporter of the arts, and funded various cultural initiatives in Italy and abroad. He was also a member of several charitable organizations, and was involved in numerous community projects in Milan.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, however, Calvi's legacy has been overshadowed by the scandals and controversies that surrounded his life and death. His case has been the subject of countless books, documentaries, and films, and continues to fascinate and intrigue people all over the world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by murder.

(July 30, 1511		Arezzo-June 27, 1574			Florence)


was
an Italian
architect, artist, author, painter and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his biographical book, "The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects", which is considered a masterpiece of art history and biography. Vasari was also a successful painter and decorator, and his artwork can be found in famous locations such as the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence and the Palazzo Pitti in Rome. He was a prominent figure in the artistic community of his time and played a significant role in promoting the Renaissance style of art throughout Europe. Despite experiencing financial difficulties throughout his career, Vasari was highly respected and admired by his contemporaries, and his contributions to art and architecture continue to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Vasari was born into a family of craftsmen and was trained in the traditional techniques of painting and architecture. He spent much of his early career working for influential figures such as the Medici family and Pope Clement VII, creating frescoes and other decorative pieces for their residences. In addition to his work as an artist, Vasari was an avid collector of art and antiquities, which he used to inform his own creative work.</p><p>One of the most significant aspects of Vasari's legacy was his role in promoting the concept of the artist as a creative genius. In "The Lives", he emphasized the importance of individual artistic expression and credited many of the most famous works of art of his time to the unique talents of their creators. This idea was central to the development of the artistic culture of the Renaissance and had a profound influence on subsequent generations of artists.</p><p>In addition to his work as an artist and author, Vasari was actively involved in the cultural and political life of his time. He served as a councillor in Florence and was instrumental in the establishment of the Accademia del Disegno, a professional organization for artists and designers.</p><p>Today, Vasari's work is still regarded as some of the most important and influential of the Renaissance period. His vivid depictions of the lives and works of the great masters of Italian art have become essential reading for students of art history, while his own paintings and decorative works continue to be admired and studied by artists and scholars around the world.</p><p>Vasari's writing style and his emphasis on the importance of individual genius in artistic creation have also had a significant impact on the field of art history. His approach to biography influenced later writers such as John Ruskin and Walter Pater, while his belief in the value of art for its own sake helped pave the way for movements such as Aestheticism.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Vasari's personal life was marked by tragedy. He lost his father at a young age and his first wife died in childbirth. Later in life, he suffered the loss of his son and several close friends. Nevertheless, he remained dedicated to his work, proclaiming that "God has given me the gift of painting and writing, and I intend to use it until the end of my days."</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to the world of art and architecture, Vasari was buried in the Church of Santa Croce in Florence, among the tombs of many other great Renaissance figures. Today, his legacy lives on as a testament to the power of creativity, individuality, and passion in shaping the world around us.</p><p>Vasari's interests were not limited to art and architecture. He was also an avid reader and writer, and his studies in literature and poetry influenced his artistic style. In addition, he had a strong interest in science and technology, and he was involved in several engineering projects, including the design of a flood control system on the Arno River. He was also known for his work as a designer and stage director for theatrical productions.Vasari's influence can be seen not only in the art world but also in the broader cultural landscape. His ideas about individual genius and creativity have resonated across disciplines, and his emphasis on the importance of education and professional organizations has played a role in shaping the modern world of work.Vasari's hometown of Arezzo has honored him with several monuments and landmarks, including a museum dedicated to his life and work. His impact on the world of art and culture is a testament to the enduring power of creativity and the human spirit.</p><p></p><p>

(May 24, 1494		Empoli-January 2, 1557			Florence)

	
		a.k.a. Jacopo Pontormo, Jacopo Carrucci, Jacopo Carrucci, called Pontormo or Jacopo da Pontormo

	
was
an Italian
artist, painter and visual artist.


					</p><p>One of the leading painters of the Mannerist period, Pontormo was trained in the studio of Andrea del Sarto and was heavily influenced by the work of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. His style was characterized by elongated proportions, contorted poses, and a heightened sense of emotion and drama, often expressed through the use of strong, vivid colors. </p><p>Pontormo is best known for his altarpieces and frescoes, including his famous work, "The Deposition," created for the Capponi Chapel in Florence. He also created numerous portraits, both independent works and as part of larger commissions, many of which demonstrate his innovative and experimental approach to composition and color. </p><p>In addition to his work as a painter, Pontormo was also an accomplished draughtsman, creating numerous preparatory drawings for his paintings and other works. He was equally accomplished in other media such as etching and engraving. </p><p>Throughout his career, Pontormo was recognized as one of the leading artists of his time, with many of his works being commissioned by powerful patrons such as the Medici family. Although his later years were marked by illness and financial difficulties, his innovative approach to painting and his enduring legacy continue to inspire artists to this day.</p><p>Pontormo's early style was heavily influenced by the Renaissance master Andrea del Sarto, with whom he trained for several years. Later in life, Pontormo developed his own distinct style, characterized by a heightened sense of emotion and drama, as well as a departure from the idealized human form popular in Renaissance art. Pontormo's work was also notable for its imaginative and unconventional compositions, often featuring figures clustered together in unusual poses and settings.</p><p>In addition to his artistic achievements, Pontormo was also known for his eccentricity and reclusive nature. He reportedly lived alone for much of his life and was known to have a fiercely independent streak. Despite his isolated lifestyle, however, Pontormo remained deeply connected to the artistic and intellectual circles of Florence, collaborating with other artists and thinkers on various projects throughout his career.</p><p>Today, Pontormo is widely regarded as one of the most important artists of the Mannerist period, and his work continues to be celebrated and studied by art historians, artists, and art lovers around the world. Many of his paintings are now housed in prestigious museums and galleries, and his influence on subsequent generations of artists can be seen in the work of everyone from Caravaggio to Francis Bacon.</p><p>Pontormo's life was marked by a number of personal tragedies, including the deaths of many of his closest family members and friends. Despite these difficulties, however, he remained dedicated to his art, often finding solace and inspiration in his work. In addition to his iconic altarpieces and portraits, Pontormo also created a number of small-scale works, including delicate drawings and sketches that reveal his immense talent for line and form.</p><p>Although he faced significant financial difficulties throughout his career, Pontormo continued to produce innovative and groundbreaking works of art until his death at the age of 62. Today, his legacy endures as a testament to his unparalleled skill as a painter, his relentless pursuit of artistic excellence, and his boundless creativity and imagination. Whether viewed in person or studied in art history textbooks, Pontormo's work continues to captivate and inspire, offering a window into a world of unparalleled beauty, drama, and emotion.</p><p>Pontormo's innovative style was often misunderstood during his lifetime, with some critics even accusing him of being "mad" or "insane." However, his unconventional approach to painting and composition would ultimately become a major influence on the development of Baroque art in the 17th century. His use of vivid colors, dramatic poses, and emotional intensity foreshadowed many of the key characteristics of the Baroque style, which is often seen as a natural evolution of Mannerism.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Pontormo's personal life remains somewhat enigmatic. He was known for his eccentricities, such as his preference for wearing brightly colored clothing and his tendency to talk to himself. He was also rumored to have struggled with depression and anxiety throughout his life, which may have been exacerbated by his many personal losses.</p><p>Despite these challenges, however, Pontormo remained deeply committed to his art, which he saw as a means of transcending the limitations of his own life and achieving something that would endure long after he was gone. His legacy continues to inspire and captivate art enthusiasts of all ages, and his innovative approach to painting and composition remains an important influence on artists around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(January 20, 1791		Bellano-December 10, 1853			Milan)


was
an Italian
personality.


					</p><p>He was best known for his work as a poet, novelist, and playwright during the Italian Romantic era. Grossi's most famous work is the novel Marco Visconti, which tells the story of a nobleman during the Middle Ages in Lombardy. His writing often focused on the struggles of the common people, and he was highly regarded for his ability to capture the regional dialects of Lombardy in his works. In addition to his literary contributions, Grossi was also involved in politics and served as a member of the Lombard parliament during the period of Italian unification. Grossi's legacy continues to be celebrated in Italy, with numerous awards and institutions named in his honor.</p><p>Despite being a prominent writer during the Romantic period, Grossi's life was not always easy. He was born into a poor family and had to work a variety of odd jobs to support himself throughout his life. However, he never gave up on his passion for writing and continued to produce works that were beloved by many. In fact, his novel Marco Visconti was so popular that it was translated into several different languages and adapted into numerous plays and operas.</p><p>Grossi was also well-known for his charitable work, particularly in his home region of Lombardy. Throughout his life, he donated his time and money to help those in need and was considered a champion of the poor. He was also an early supporter of Italian unification and worked tirelessly to promote the cause throughout his political career.</p><p>Today, Grossi is considered one of Italy's greatest literary figures, with many scholars praising him for his ability to capture the essence of Lombard culture and language in his writing. His work continues to be taught in schools and universities across Italy, and he is remembered as a true champion of the people.</p><p>Grossi's interest in literature began at a young age, and he was largely self-taught. He studied the works of great Italian writers such as Dante and Petrarch and also took inspiration from the works of Shakespeare and Goethe. Despite his lack of formal education, Grossi quickly developed a reputation as a talented writer and was praised by many of his contemporaries.</p><p>In addition to his literary and political pursuits, Grossi was also a devoted family man. He was married to Maria Vittoria Frosconi, with whom he had six children. Despite the challenges he faced throughout his life, Grossi remained dedicated to his family and was a loving husband and father.</p><p>Grossi's contributions to Italian literature and culture have not gone unnoticed. In 1862, a monument was erected in his honor in his hometown of Bellano, and in 1911, the Tommaso Grossi Society was formed to promote and preserve his legacy. Today, his works continue to inspire and captivate readers around the world, cementing his place in Italian literary history.</p><p>Grossi's impact on Italian literature was so significant that he is often considered the founder of the Lombard School of Romanticism. This school of thought was characterized by its emphasis on regionalism and its rejection of the traditional Tuscan-based Italian language in favor of regional dialects, which Grossi was a prominent advocate for. His writing style, which skillfully incorporated dialects and local dialects, became a major influence on other Lombard writers in the Romantic era.</p><p>Even after his death, Grossi's influence continued to be felt in Italian literature. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a group of Lombard writers and intellectuals came together to form the Scapigliatura movement, which sought to break free from the constraints of traditional Italian literature and embrace individualism and creative expression. Grossi's works were a major source of inspiration for many members of this movement.</p><p>Today, Grossi is widely recognized as one of Italy's most important literary figures. His works continue to be read and studied by scholars around the world, and he is remembered as a champion of regionalism, political activism, and social justice. His pioneering efforts to promote local dialects and celebrate the culture of Lombardy have left an indelible mark on Italian literature and culture, and his legacy continues to inspire generations of writers and readers.</p><p></p><p>

His father, a painter and mosaicist, recognized his son's artistic talent at a young age and began to train him in the family workshop. At the age of 14, Giaquinto moved to Naples to study with Francesco Solimena, one of the leading painters of the Baroque era. He later traveled to Rome to study the works of the great masters, including Raphael and Michelangelo.</p><p>After completing his training, Giaquinto established himself as a successful painter in Naples, receiving commissions from the city's wealthiest families. His talent soon caught the attention of the Spanish Bourbon kings, who invited him to Madrid to work at the royal court. He stayed in Spain for over 20 years, creating some of his most famous works in the palaces and churches of Madrid and the surrounding areas.</p><p>In addition to his artistic achievements, Giaquinto was known for his charming personality and his ability to socialize with the aristocracy. He was always impeccably dressed and had a reputation for being a great conversationalist. Despite his success, Giaquinto remained humble and continued to teach art to young students throughout his life.</p><p>Giaquinto's influence on the Rococo style can be seen in the works of many artists who came after him, including Francisco Goya and Jacques-Louis David. His vibrant colors and bold brushstrokes were a departure from the more subdued tones of the Baroque era, and his love of drama and theatrics helped to define the Rococo style.</p><p>Today, Giaquinto's works can be seen in some of the greatest museums and galleries in the world, including the Louvre in Paris, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. His legacy as one of the greatest painters of the 18th century continues to inspire artists and art lovers around the globe.</p><p></p><p>

(January 19, 1601		Santarcangelo di Romagna-April 5, 1663			Vienna)


was
an Italian
personality.


					</p><p>Guido Cagnacci was a Baroque painter known for his sensual and dramatic works, often featuring mythological and biblical subjects. He started his artistic career working in his hometown, but he later moved to Venice, where he gained popularity and success with his unconventional and provocative style. In the 1650s, he was appointed court painter to the Habsburgs in Vienna, where he spent the rest of his life painting religious and mythological themes for the imperial collections. Despite his fame during his lifetime, Cagnacci was largely forgotten after his death, and it was only in the 20th century that his importance as a painter was rediscovered. Today, his works are prized for their daring and often controversial depiction of female nudes and the female form in general, as well as their striking use of color and composition.</p><p>Cagnacci's most acclaimed painting is his "Repentant Magdalene," which is now housed in the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California. The painting depicts a naked Mary Magdalene kneeling in a private chamber, holding a crucifix and looking up towards heaven with a sense of divine ecstasy on her face. The painting's sensuality and theatricality, combined with its religious subject matter, make it a classic example of the Baroque style. Cagnacci was also known for his portraits, which often portrayed his subjects in a sensual and seductive manner, with a focus on their physical beauty and sensuality. In addition to painting, Cagnacci was also a writer and poet, and he published several works throughout his life. Despite his success and fame, Cagnacci lived a tumultuous and often scandalous life, and his personal life was marked by numerous romantic affairs and financial difficulties. Nevertheless, his legacy as a painter endures, and his works continue to captivate viewers with their beauty, passion, and drama.</p><p>Cagnacci was born into a family of painters, and his father encouraged him to pursue art from a young age. He trained with local artists in Santarcangelo di Romagna before moving to Bologna, where he studied with the famous painter, Guercino. Cagnacci's early works were heavily influenced by Guercino's style, but he soon developed his own unique approach to painting, characterized by rich colors, fluid lines, and a strong sense of drama.</p><p>In addition to his religious and mythological paintings, Cagnacci also created several genre scenes, such as his "Death of Cleopatra" and "Tarquin and Lucretia." These paintings depicted everyday life in a highly stylized and dramatic manner, allowing Cagnacci to explore themes of passion, violence, and eroticism in a more subtle way than in his other works.</p><p>Despite his controversial subject matter, Cagnacci was highly respected in his lifetime and counted many wealthy and powerful patrons among his clients. His paintings were widely collected throughout Italy and Europe, and he was celebrated for his ability to capture the beauty and sensuality of the human form.</p><p>Today, Cagnacci's works can be found in some of the most prestigious art museums in the world, including the Louvre in Paris, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, and the National Gallery in London. His influence on the development of Baroque art continues to be felt to this day, and his legacy as one of the greatest painters of the period remains secure.</p><p>Despite his success as a painter, Cagnacci's personal life was plagued by scandals and financial struggles. He was known for his numerous romantic affairs, which often involved wealthy patrons who supported his art. One of his most notorious affairs was with the wife of a local nobleman, which resulted in a public scandal and Cagnacci being forced to flee the city. He also struggled with debt throughout his life, a problem that was exacerbated by his lavish lifestyle and his tendency to gamble.</p><p>Cagnacci's career as a painter came to a close in the 1660s, when he began to suffer from failing health. He died in Vienna in 1663, at the age of 62. Despite his fame during his lifetime, Cagnacci's reputation as a painter declined in the centuries that followed, and he was largely forgotten until the 20th century. In recent years, however, he has experienced a resurgence of interest, and his works are once again recognized for their beauty, passion, and unconventional approach to traditional subjects.</p><p></p><p>
