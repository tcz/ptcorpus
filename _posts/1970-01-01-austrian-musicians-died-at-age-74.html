(February 18, 1906		Hausbrunn-October 21, 1980			Vienna)

	
		also known as Dr. Hans Asperger

	
was
an Austrian
physician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering work in the field of child psychology and psychiatry. Asperger's most significant contribution to the field of child psychology was his identification and description of a set of behavioural and developmental characteristics that later became known as Asperger's syndrome. </p><p>Asperger's work was overshadowed for many years by that of Leo Kanner, who described autism as a distinct disorder. It wasn't until the 1980s that Asperger's work began to receive wider recognition, leading to the establishment of Asperger's syndrome as a distinct condition falling under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder. </p><p>Asperger also played a significant role in supporting the rights of children with disabilities, particularly during the Nazi regime. He worked to protect the children in his care, many of whom would have likely been sent to concentration camps if not for his efforts. </p><p>Despite his contributions to child psychology and his humanitarian work, Asperger's legacy is somewhat controversial. Recent research has revealed connections between Asperger's work and Nazi eugenics programs, suggesting that his work may have been compromised by his political beliefs. Nevertheless, Asperger remains an important figure in the history of child psychology and autism research.</p><p>Asperger spent most of his career at the University of Vienna's Clinic for Child Psychiatry, where he worked as a lecturer and physician. He also published extensively on topics related to child psychology, including numerous papers on autism and Asperger's syndrome. In addition to his work with children, Asperger also wrote about adult psychiatry and the psychological effects of war. His influence can be seen in the work of many researchers and clinicians in the field of autism research, including the inclusion of Asperger's syndrome as a diagnostic category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) in 1994. Today, Asperger's syndrome is widely recognized as a distinct condition falling under the autism spectrum disorder umbrella, and it is estimated that around 1 in 200 people have the condition. Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, Asperger's contributions have helped to improve the lives of countless individuals with autism and their families.</p><p>Asperger was born in Hausbrunn, Austria, and showed an early interest in science and medicine. He studied medicine at the University of Vienna, where he later became a lecturer and physician. Asperger was a keen observer of children, and his work in child psychology and psychiatry was inspired by his lifelong fascination with their behaviour and development. He worked with children who had a range of mental and developmental conditions, including autism, and his clinical insights helped to shape our understanding of these conditions.</p><p>Asperger's interest in autism began in the 1930s, at a time when the condition was largely unknown. He noticed that some of the children in his care had a distinct set of symptoms, including social awkwardness, repetitive behaviour, and an intense focus on certain topics. He published a series of papers on these children, describing them as having "autistic psychopathy", a term that was later shortened to autism. Asperger's work was instrumental in establishing autism as a distinct condition, and his insights into the various forms that it could take laid the groundwork for the later discovery of Asperger's syndrome.</p><p>Despite living in Austria during the tumultuous years of the Nazi regime, Asperger remained committed to his work and his patients. He helped to protect his patients from the horrors of the concentration camps, and his efforts likely saved the lives of many children with disabilities. However, recent research has raised questions about Asperger's involvement with the Nazi regime, and it is now known that he was a member of several Nazi organizations. This has led to a reevaluation of his legacy, and many researchers and clinicians are grappling with the ethical implications of his work.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his life and work, Hans Asperger's contributions to child psychology and psychiatry remain significant. His insights into the nature of autism have helped to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this condition, and his advocacy for children with disabilities has had a lasting impact. As we continue to learn more about autism and its many forms, Asperger's work remains a vital part of our collective understanding of this complex condition.</p><p>Asperger's legacy has also had an impact on popular culture, with the term "Asperger's syndrome" becoming widely recognized among the general public. Many books, films, and television shows have featured characters with Asperger's syndrome, helping to increase public awareness and understanding of this condition. However, there are concerns that these portrayals may not always accurately represent the experiences of individuals with Asperger's syndrome, and some have called for more nuanced and diverse representations in the media.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to child psychology and psychiatry, Asperger was also a devoted family man. He was married and had five children, and he remained close to his family throughout his life. Despite the challenges he faced during his career, he was known for his warmth, kindness, and dedication to his patients.</p><p>Asperger passed away in Vienna in 1980 at the age of 74. His life and work continue to be the subject of much discussion and debate, with many researchers and clinicians grappling with the complexities of his legacy. Whatever our opinions of his life and work may be, there can be no doubt that Asperger's contributions have had a lasting impact on the field of child psychology and the lives of countless individuals with autism and their families.</p><p>Asperger's syndrome was officially added to the DSM-IV as a distinct diagnosis in 1994, and in 2013, it was replaced by the broader category of autism spectrum disorder in the DSM-V. The change was made to reflect recent research showing that there is no clear boundary between Asperger's syndrome and other forms of autism. Despite the change in diagnosis, Asperger's name continues to be used to refer to a milder form of autism in which individuals have average or above-average intelligence, good language skills, and a strong interest in specific topics. </p><p>In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of Asperger's involvement with the Nazi regime. A study published in 2018 revealed that Asperger, in addition to being a member of several Nazi organizations, actively participated in the euthanasia program that targeted individuals with disabilities. This revelation has led to calls for a reevaluation of Asperger's legacy, with some researchers and advocates arguing that the use of his name to describe a form of autism should be discontinued. Others have argued that while Asperger's involvement with Nazism is deeply troubling, his contributions to the field of child psychology and psychiatry should still be recognized.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his legacy, there is no denying that Hans Asperger was a pioneering figure in the field of child psychology and psychiatry. His insights into the nature of autism and the various forms it can take have helped to improve the lives of countless individuals with autism and their families. As we continue to learn more about autism and its many forms, Asperger's work remains an important part of our shared history and ongoing efforts to understand and support individuals with autism.</p><p>Asperger's work has also inspired many researchers and clinicians to further explore the various forms of autism, and his insights have contributed to the development of new diagnostic and treatment tools. His advocacy for the rights of children with disabilities has also had a lasting impact, with many organizations now dedicated to supporting individuals with autism and their families. In addition to his lasting contributions to the field of child psychology and psychiatry, Asperger's legacy has also sparked important discussions about the intersection of science, politics, and morality. As we continue to grapple with the complexity of Asperger's life and work, his contributions remain a vital part of our collective understanding of the many challenges facing individuals with autism and their families.</p><p></p><p>
