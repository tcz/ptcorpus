Despite facing discrimination as a Jewish woman in Nazi-occupied France, she continued to perform and composed music for films and stage productions.

She also used her position in the orchestra to help her fellow prisoners survive by providing them with extra food and clothing.</p><p>After her release in 1945, Fénelon continued to perform and became a vocal advocate for the rights of Holocaust survivors. She also became involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and performed benefit concerts for Jewish refugees. In recognition of her work, Fénelon was awarded the Israel Prize for Arts in 1973.</p><p>In addition to "Playing for Time", Fénelon wrote several other books, including "J'Ai Baiser Ta Gueule" and "Une Musique Interdite".
