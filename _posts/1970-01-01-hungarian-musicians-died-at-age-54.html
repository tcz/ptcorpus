was
a Hungarian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a renowned poet, literary critic, and translator who played an instrumental role in the Hungarian literary scene of the 19th century. Bajza was born in Kecskemét, Hungary and was fascinated by literature from a young age. He moved to Pest to further his studies and became heavily involved in the literary circles of the city. </p><p>Bajza's poetic works were heavily influenced by the romantic era and he was particularly known for his love poems. In addition to writing his own works, Bajza also translated many literary classics into Hungarian, including works by Goethe, Byron, and Shakespeare. As a literary critic, Bajza was known for his insightful and detailed analysis of the works of other writers, and his opinions commanded great respect among his contemporaries. </p><p>Bajza also had a significant impact on the development of Hungarian theater. He wrote several plays, some of which attained great popularity during his lifetime. He also served as a director of the Hungarian National Theater in Pest for a time. </p><p>József Bajza passed away at the age of 54 from a heart attack, but his contributions to Hungarian literature and theater continue to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Bajza was a prolific writer, and over the course of his career, he produced numerous works of poetry, prose, and drama. His most famous works include the poetry collections "Emlékeim" and "Költemények," as well as the plays "Az Aranyábránd" and "A Hajdú."

(December 29, 1891		Budapest-February 28, 1946			Budapest)

	
		also known as Bela Imredy

	
was
a Hungarian
politician and economist.


					</p><p>He served as the Prime Minister of Hungary from 1938 to 1939. Imrédy was a member of the far-right wing party, Arrow Cross Party, and was known for his authoritarian and fascist views. During his tenure as Prime Minister, Imrédy passed several anti-Semitic measures and established closer ties with Nazi Germany. However, his term was short-lived as he was forced to resign due to his inability to secure Hungary's independence and territorial integrity during World War II. After the war, he was arrested and tried for war crimes and collaboration with the Nazis by the Allied authorities in Hungary. In 1946, he was convicted and executed by hanging.</p><p>Prior to his tenure as Prime Minister, Imrédy had a successful career in finance and business, serving as director of several large companies in Hungary. He also served as Minister of Trade and Director of the Hungarian National Bank in the late 1930s. Imrédy was seen as a charismatic figure by his supporters and played a key role in the rearmament of Hungary prior to World War II. However, he was also known for his authoritarian and nationalist views, which led to his alignment with far-right and fascist movements in Hungary. Despite his controversial legacy, Imrédy remains an important figure in Hungarian political history for his role in the country's political and economic transformations during the interwar period.</p><p>Imrédy led a campaign to increase the size of the Hungarian armed forces, and worked to strengthen ties with Italy and Nazi Germany in order to achieve this goal. In addition to his anti-Semitic policies, he also passed laws that restricted the rights of ethnic minorities, including Roma and Romanian people living in Hungary. Imrédy's alignment with Nazi Germany eventually led to his downfall, as he was unable to keep Hungary out of the war after the country was occupied by German troops in 1944. Despite his controversial legacy, there are still some in Hungary who view Imrédy as a national hero who tried to resist the Soviet occupation of Hungary after the war.</p><p>During his early political career, Imrédy was a member of the Hungarian Independence Party and the National Radical Party. He became the leader of the National Unity Party in 1938, which was a coalition of several right-wing and far-right parties. Imrédy believed in a strong centralized government with authoritarian control and supported policies that would benefit the Hungarian middle class. However, his policies were not always popular with the Hungarian people, and his government faced significant opposition from both the left and the right.</p><p>Imrédy's ties to Nazi Germany were not without controversy, and he was often accused of being a German puppet by his political opponents. Despite this, Imrédy continued to pursue closer ties with Germany, believing that it was the only way to ensure Hungary's security and territorial integrity. However, Hungary's involvement in the war proved to be disastrous, and Imrédy was eventually forced to resign as Prime Minister.</p><p>After his conviction and execution, Imrédy's legacy was tarnished by his collaboration with Nazi Germany and his role in implementing anti-Semitic policies. However, there are still those who view him as a nationalist hero who tried to defend Hungary from Communist oppression. Imrédy's controversial legacy continues to be debated in Hungary today, with opinions divided between those who support his authoritarian policies and those who condemn his collaboration with Nazi Germany.</p><p>Imrédy's fascist views and anti-Semitic policies have had lasting and devastating effects on Hungary's Jewish population. During his tenure as Prime Minister, Imrédy passed laws that restricted the rights of Jews, including denying them access to certain professions and revoking their citizenship. These policies paved the way for the mass deportations and murder of Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of nearly 600,000 Hungarian Jews. In the years following the war, Hungary continued to struggle with its legacy of anti-Semitism, and the country's Jewish population has faced discrimination and violence to this day. </p><p>Despite Imrédy's controversial and divisive legacy, there is no denying his role in shaping Hungary's political and economic history during the interwar period. His efforts to rearm Hungary and bolster its military strength reflected his belief in creating a strong and centralized government, although this came at a great cost to minority groups within Hungary.  Imrédy's collaboration with Nazi Germany and his prosecution for war crimes served as a warning against the dangers of authoritarianism and fascism, and his story serves as a reminder of the need for vigilance against extremism and hate.</p><p></p><p>

was
a Hungarian
journalist and writer.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Gyula Krúdy, Ilona Krúdy, Mária Krúdy and Zsuzsa Krudy.

						</p><p>Krúdy was known for his romantic and nostalgic writing style that often drew from his personal experiences and imagination. He began his literary career as a journalist, working for various newspapers and magazines in Budapest before transitioning to fiction writing. Krúdy wrote over 80 novels and novellas, many of which are set in Budapest and feature a cast of colorful characters. His most famous work is "The Adventures of Sindbad," a collection of stories featuring the recurring character Sindbad, a womanizing bon vivant. Despite his prolificacy, Krúdy struggled with alcoholism and financial instability throughout his life. He died in poverty and obscurity, but his work has since been rediscovered and he is now regarded as one of Hungary's greatest writers.</p><p>Krúdy's upbringing was marked by tragedy and loss; his father died when he was just six years old, and his mother passed away 11 years later. Despite this hardship, his literary talent was evident from a young age. He published his first short story at the age of 18 and went on to win several literary prizes throughout his career.</p><p>Krúdy's writing was deeply influenced by Hungarian folklore and the country's romantic literary tradition. He was also inspired by the bohemian lifestyle and debauchery of Budapest's café society, which served as the backdrop for many of his stories.</p><p>In addition to his fiction writing, Krúdy was also a prolific journalist and wrote extensively on a wide range of topics, from local politics to theater reviews. He was a regular contributor to Budapest's leading newspapers and magazines, including Az Est, Nyugat, and Pesti Napló.</p><p>Krúdy's work fell out of favor during the communist era in Hungary, but in recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in his writing. His work has been translated into numerous languages and he is now recognized as one of the most important writers of Hungarian literature.</p><p>Krúdy's personal life was also marked by a series of scandalous affairs and marriages. He was married seven times and often had multiple mistresses at the same time. He had a reputation as a womanizer and was known for his hedonistic lifestyle. Despite this, Krúdy maintained a close relationship with his children and often wrote about them in his stories. </p><p>Krúdy's legacy in Hungarian literature is significant, as his writing style influenced many other writers of his time and beyond. His romanticized portrayal of everyday life in Budapest and his use of language to create a dreamy and nostalgic atmosphere have earned him a place among the greats of Hungarian literature. Several museums and memorials have been dedicated to his memory, including the Gyula Krúdy House Museum in Budapest.</p><p>Krúdy's personal life was often as fantastical as the worlds he created in his writing. He was known for his eccentricities, such as his habit of writing in cafes and bars instead of a quiet office. He was even rumored to have once spent an entire day writing a novel in a brothel. Krúdy also had a fascination with the supernatural, and incorporated elements of the occult and mystical into some of his stories. In addition to his literary contributions, Krúdy was also a passionate advocate for cultural preservation, particularly in the face of the rapid modernization of Budapest. He believed that the city's rich history and traditions were in danger of being lost forever, and wrote articles and essays urging Hungarians to embrace their cultural heritage. Krúdy's impact on Hungarian literature can still be felt today, and his work continues to inspire and captivate readers both in Hungary and around the world.</p><p>In addition to writing novels and journalism, Krúdy also penned plays and screenplays. His play, "The Discontented Women," was a critical and commercial success, and was later adapted into a film. Krúdy's interest in film extended beyond writing, as he also acted in a few of the early Hungarian films. Krúdy's contribution to Hungarian culture was recognized even during his lifetime. He was awarded the Baumgarten Prize, one of Hungary's highest literary honors, in 1932. Despite his tumultuous personal life and financial struggles, Krúdy's legacy endures, and his writing continues to be celebrated for its unique voice and vivid depictions of pre-World War I Budapest.</p><p></p><p>

(April 16, 1466		Kraków-August 2, 1520			Nysa)


was
a Hungarian
personality.


					</p><p>The Thurzó family was a prominent noble family in Hungary during the late medieval and early modern periods. The family was known for their wealth, power, and influence in both Hungary and Poland. One of the most famous members of the family was George Thurzó, who served as Palatine of Hungary from 1609-1616. He is credited with playing a key role in the capture and trial of Elizabeth Bathory, a noblewoman who was accused of killing young girls in the late 16th-early 17th century. The Thurzó family's legacy continues to be felt in both Hungary and Poland today.</p><p>Another notable member of the Thurzó family was Miklós Thurzó, who served as Palatine of Hungary from 1616-1625. He was a key figure in the overthrow of Gabriel Bethlen, the Prince of Transylvania, and later played an important role in the election of Ferdinand II as King of Hungary. Miklós was also a patron of the arts, and his support helped to establish the Jesuit College in Budapest. In addition to his political and cultural contributions, Miklós was also known for his charitable work, particularly his efforts to provide food and shelter to the poor. His legacy is commemorated by the Miklós Thurzó Prize, which is awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences to recognize outstanding contributions to Hungarian literature and culture.</p><p>Another famous member of the Thurzó family was Imre Thököly, who led a Hungarian uprising against the Habsburgs in the late 17th century. Thököly was a military commander who fought to preserve Hungarian independence during a time of Ottoman and Habsburg expansion. He formed alliances with other European powers, including Louis XIV of France, in order to gain support for his cause. Despite his efforts, the rebellion ultimately failed, and Thököly was forced to flee to the Ottoman Empire. He spent the rest of his life in exile, but remained a symbol of Hungarian resistance to foreign rule. Today, Thököly is celebrated as a national hero in Hungary, and his legacy continues to inspire those who fight for freedom and independence.</p><p>The Thurzó family also had a significant impact on the development of art in Hungary. György Thurzó, a prominent member of the family in the 16th century, was an art collector who amassed a large collection of paintings, sculptures, and other works of art. He was particularly interested in Italian Renaissance art, and his collection included works by Raphael, Giorgione, and Titian. The collection was eventually inherited by Miklós Thurzó, who expanded it and added works by Dutch and Flemish artists. Many of the works in the Thurzó Collection are now housed in museums in Hungary, including the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest.</p><p>The Thurzó family also had ties to the Protestant Reformation, and several members of the family were staunch supporters of the movement. János Thurzó, for example, was a close friend and supporter of the reformer John Calvin. He was instrumental in spreading the ideas of the Reformation in Hungary, and his support helped to establish Calvinism as a major religious movement in the country. Other members of the family, such as István Thurzó, were involved in the establishment of Lutheran churches in Hungary.</p><p>Today, the Thurzó family is remembered for their contributions to Hungarian culture, politics, and society. Their legacy continues to inspire Hungarians to strive for excellence and to work for the betterment of the country.</p><p>One of the most interesting facts about the Thurzó family is that they were known for their alchemy experiments. Many members of the family were fascinated by the idea of turning base metals into gold and created their own laboratories for conducting experiments. One of the most famous alchemists in the family was Miklós Thurzó, who was said to have created the "Elixir of Life," a substance that was believed to cure all illnesses and grant eternal youth. Despite their many experiments, the Thurzó family was never able to discover the secret of alchemy, and the practice slowly died out over time. However, their passion for experimentation and their belief in the power of science helped to pave the way for future scientific discoveries in Hungary.</p><p></p><p>

(October 25, 1903		Debrecen-November 1, 1957			Mount Kisco)


was
a Hungarian
rabbi.


					</p><p>He is best known for his efforts to try and save Jews during the Holocaust. During World War II, Weissmandl played a key role in the Slovakian Jewish community and was involved in a number of resistance efforts against the Nazis. He also helped organize the rescue of thousands of Jews through efforts such as the "Blood for Goods" program, where Jews were able to trade their valuables for train tickets out of the country. After the war, Weissmandl immigrated to the United States, where he continued to work for Jewish causes, and wrote extensively on Jewish law, ethics, and history.</p><p>Weissmandl was born into a family of rabbis and scholars, and he himself went on to become a respected authority in Jewish law and tradition. He received his rabbinical education in Hungary and later became the head of a yeshiva in Slovakia. During the war, Weissmandl corresponded with Jewish leaders around the world, urging them to take action to save Jewish lives. He also wrote a secret document called the "Auschwitz Protocols," which detailed the atrocities being committed in the concentration camps, and tried to get it to the Allies to convince them to take action. Sadly, his efforts were largely unsuccessful.</p><p>After the war, Weissmandl became a vocal advocate for the establishment of the state of Israel, and worked to help resettle Jewish survivors in Palestine. He also continued his scholarly work, writing books and articles on Jewish law and ethics. Weissmandl's legacy lives on through his writings and his heroic efforts to save Jewish lives during one of the darkest chapters in human history.</p><p>Weissmandl was not only a rabbi, but also a scholar and researcher, and he made significant contributions to the fields of mathematics and science. He was particularly interested in the study of topology, a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties of shapes and spaces. In fact, he was the first person to describe what is now known as a Fractal, a complex geometric shape that exhibits self-similarity at different scales.</p><p>Weissmandl was also a strong believer in the importance of educating Jewish children, and he established schools in Slovakia that were dedicated to teaching Jewish values and knowledge. In addition, he was a proponent of Zionism, the movement that called for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and he played an important role in the creation of Israel.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Weissmandl remained humble and dedicated to his faith and his community. He passed away in 1957, but his legacy continues to inspire people around the world to work for justice and peace. In recognition of his contributions, Yad Vashem, Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, has named him one of the "Righteous among the Nations," a title given to non-Jewish individuals who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust.</p><p>Weissmandl's dedication to saving Jewish lives during the Holocaust went beyond just organizing rescues and resistance efforts. He also worked tirelessly to acquire funds and resources for the Jewish community, using his connections to wealthy donors and non-Jewish allies. He believed that every method should be used to help save as many Jewish lives as possible. This sometimes put him at odds with other Jewish leaders who believed that negotiation and diplomacy with the Nazis was the best course of action. Weissmandl believed that these methods were ineffective and argued that the only way to save Jewish lives was to actively resist and fight against the Nazis.</p><p>In addition to his work during the war and his contributions to mathematics and science, Weissmandl was also a prolific writer and scholar. He wrote extensively on topics such as Jewish law, ethics, and history, and his works continue to be studied and respected in Jewish communities around the world. His most famous book, "Min HaMaitzar" (From the Depths), was written during the war and served as a source of inspiration and guidance for many Jews who were struggling to survive.</p><p>Weissmandl's legacy continues to be celebrated and honored by Jewish communities around the world. His selflessness, bravery, and dedication to helping others serve as an inspiration to all those who seek to make the world a better place.</p><p>Weissmandl's legacy also includes his contributions to the field of cryptography, which he used extensively during the war to communicate with other Jewish leaders and resistance fighters. He developed a number of sophisticated codes and cipher machines, which helped to keep their communications secure and prevented Nazi intercepts. His work in this area was so advanced that it was not fully understood until decades after the war ended. Weissmandl's coding techniques and machines have since been studied and analyzed by the U.S. National Security Agency and have been cited as groundbreaking for their time.</p><p>Throughout his life, Weissmandl remained committed to his faith, and he believed that all Jews had a responsibility to uphold the values of justice and compassion. He worked tirelessly to promote these values in his community and to help those in need, regardless of their background or beliefs. His legacy represents the best of human decency and the power of one person to make a difference in the face of great adversity.</p><p></p><p>
