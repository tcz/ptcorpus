He authored many influential books, including "Of Grammatology," "Writing and Difference," and "Margins of Philosophy." </p><p>Aside from his contributions to philosophy, Derrida was also an active supporter of human rights and political struggles throughout the world. He opposed apartheid in South Africa and was an outspoken critic of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His work continues to be highly regarded and widely studied in academia today.</p><p></p><p>
