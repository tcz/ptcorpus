					</p><p>Noe Itō was a prominent feminist and anarchist in early 20th-century Japan. She played a crucial role in organizing women and laborers, and strongly advocated for women's emancipation and the overthrow of the capitalist system. Itō was a prolific writer and published numerous articles, essays, and translations, including the first Japanese translation of "The Communist Manifesto". In addition to her political activism, Itō was also an accomplished poet and novelist, and her works often explored themes of love, desire, and gender identity. Her life and writings continue to inspire feminists and activists in Japan and around the world.</p><p>Itō was born into a wealthy family in Fukuoka, Japan. However, she became disillusioned with her privileged upbringing and began seeking ways to challenge the status quo. After graduating from high school, she moved to Tokyo and became involved in the anarchist movement. Itō believed that the state and the capitalist system were oppressive and that true freedom could only be achieved through the collective efforts of people.</p><p>In 1914, Itō founded an anarchist feminist group called The Feminist Association, which focused on raising awareness about women's issues and organizing women workers. She also worked closely with labor organizers and was a vocal advocate for workers' rights. Itō's activism was not limited to Japan, and she traveled to the United States and Europe to attend conferences and meet with like-minded activists.</p><p>Despite facing criticism and persecution from the government and society at large, Itō continued to speak out against injustice until her untimely death at the age of 28. She was murdered by her estranged husband, who could not accept her independent and feminist views. Her legacy lives on, and she remains an important figure in Japanese feminist and anarchist history.</p><p></p><p>
						She died caused by murder.
