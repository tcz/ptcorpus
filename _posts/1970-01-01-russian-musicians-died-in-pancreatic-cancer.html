a Russian
actor, pianist and singer.


					</p><p>She began her career as a pianist, studying at the Moscow Conservatory, but later turned to acting and singing. Orlova became one of the most popular actresses in Soviet cinema during the 1930s and 1940s, appearing in numerous films, including the musical comedy "Jolly Fellows" (1934) and the war drama "The Circus" (1936). She was known for her natural and charismatic performances and her powerful singing voice. Orlova was also widely admired for her beauty and fashion sense. In addition to her acting career, she was involved in various cultural and charitable organizations, and she performed for Soviet troops during World War II. After her death, Orlova was honored as a People's Artist of the USSR, and her legacy continues to inspire generations of Russian performers.</p><p>Orlova's talent and charisma extended beyond the Soviet Union, gaining her international recognition as well. She was invited to perform in France, where she gained a fan following and was dubbed as the "Soviet Muse" by the French press. Her performance in the movie “Volga-Volga” (1938), which was directed by Grigori Aleksandrov and co-starred Igor Ilyinsky, became a huge success both in the Soviet Union and abroad. It was also the first Soviet film to be released in the United States. Orlova's fame grew to such heights that Adolf Hitler himself allegedly offered her a high position in the German cinema industry if she agreed to become a German citizen, which she declined. Despite pressure from the government to divorce her Jewish husband, Orlova remained loyal to him and continued to work in the Soviet film industry until her death in 1975. Today, she is still regarded as one of the most iconic actresses in Russian cinema history.</p><p>In addition to her acting and singing career, Lyubov Orlova was also involved in political activism. During World War II, she joined other popular Soviet artists to form the Soviet Anti-Fascist Committee, which aimed to rally support for the war effort and spread anti-Nazi propaganda. However, after the war, the committee was disbanded by Soviet authorities, and many of its members were persecuted and imprisoned. Orlova was not spared from the government's crackdown on dissent, and she was forced to divorce her second husband, the director Grigori Aleksandrov, who was also a member of the committee. Despite these challenges, Orlova continued to work in the film industry and remained a beloved figure among the Soviet people until her death. In addition to her many accolades, she was also posthumously awarded the Order of Lenin, one of the highest honors in the USSR.</p><p></p><p>
