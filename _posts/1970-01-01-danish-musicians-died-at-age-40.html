(September 25, 1944		Hundige-January 3, 1985			Copenhagen)

	
		a.k.a. Queen of Bestiality, Bodil B. Joensen, Bodil Jørgensen or Boar Girl

	
was
a Danish
pornographic film actor and farmer.


					</p><p>Bodil Joensen gained notoriety for her involvement in bestiality pornography during the 1970s, where she engaged in sexual acts with various animals on her farm. She starred in several films of this nature produced by Color Climax Corporation, a Danish pornographic film company. Despite her controversial career in pornography, Bodil was also known for her love for animals and her work as a farmer, where she cared for pigs, cows, and horses. Her upbringing in a strict religious family in Denmark, where sex was not discussed, has been speculated to have played a role in her involvement in adult films. However, there were also reports of her experiencing sexual abuse as a child. After her career in pornography, Bodil struggled with alcoholism and died at the age of 40 due to complications from cirrhosis.</p><p>Bodil Joensen's story is a tragic one, marked by controversy and struggle. Born on a farm in the Danish village of Hundige in 1944, Joensen grew up in a conservative, religious household. Despite her love for animals, she was forced to leave school early to work on the family farm. It was here that she began to experiment sexually with the animals she cared for, leading to her eventual involvement in bestiality pornography.</p><p>Joensen's career in adult films began in the early 1970s, when she was discovered by the Color Climax Corporation. She quickly became one of their most popular performers, starring in a series of films that would earn her the nickname "Queen of Bestiality." Despite her success, Joensen's involvement in pornography took a toll on her mental health, and she began to struggle with alcoholism.</p><p>In the years following her retirement from pornography, Joensen continued to live on the family farm and care for her beloved animals. Despite attempts to distance herself from her past, however, she remained haunted by her involvement in bestiality and the stigma attached to it. Her struggles with addiction continued, and in 1985, she died at the age of 40 due to complications from cirrhosis.</p><p>Today, Joensen's legacy remains a controversial and complicated one, with many remembering her as a victim of sexual abuse and exploitation rather than a willing participant in the industry that made her famous. Regardless of how she is remembered, however, it is clear that she was a woman who lived her life on her own terms, both in her love for animals and her willingness to explore her sexuality in ways that many would consider taboo.</p><p></p><p>
