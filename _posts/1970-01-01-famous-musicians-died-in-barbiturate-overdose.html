(November 13, 1938		Marshalltown-August 30, 1979			Paris)

	
		also known as Jean Dorothy Seberg

	
was
an American
actor.


					
			
		She had
		two
		children,
		Alexandre Diego Gary and Nina Hart Gary.

						</p><p>Seberg rose to fame with her starring role in the iconic film "Breathless" (1960), directed by Jean-Luc Godard. She quickly became a fashion icon and appeared in numerous films such as "Lilith" (1964), "Moment to Moment" (1965), and "Airport" (1970). </p><p>In addition to her acting career, Seberg was also a political activist and outspoken supporter of various civil rights causes. She was involved in the Black Panther Party and was later targeted by the FBI's COINTELPRO program, leading to intense surveillance and harassment that greatly impacted her mental health.</p><p>Tragically, Seberg died by suicide at the age of 40 in Paris, where she was living at the time. Her legacy as a brave and talented performer, as well as her activism and persecution by the government, continue to be remembered and celebrated today.</p><p>Seberg was born in Marshalltown, Iowa and grew up in a small town called Marshalltown, where she was an active student and participated in numerous school plays. She began her career as a model, which led to her being discovered by Otto Preminger, who cast her as the lead in his film "Saint Joan" (1957). She then moved to France, where she made "Breathless" and became an international star. In addition to her film work, Seberg also appeared on stage in various productions, including a stage adaptation of "Aimez-vous Brahms?" in New York in the late 1960s. She also recorded several albums, including a collaboration with Serge Gainsbourg. After her death, Seberg's legacy continued to grow, with a documentary about her life released in 2019 and a biopic in development.</p><p>Seberg's personal life was often tumultuous. She was married three times - first to French writer Fran√ßois Moreuil, then to American filmmaker Romain Gary, with whom she had her two children, and finally to Algerian author and diplomat Ahmed Hasni. Her relationships were sometimes controversial, and she faced criticism from the media for her public affair with Black Panther leader Hakim Jamal.</p><p>Seberg's activism and association with the Black Panther Party had a significant impact on her life. She was closely monitored by the FBI, who spread false rumors about her personal life and even went as far as creating a fake news story about her pregnancy in an attempt to discredit her. The constant surveillance and harassment took a toll on her mental health, and she struggled with depression and paranoia.</p><p>Despite the challenges she faced in her personal life, Seberg remained committed to her work and her activism. She used her status as a famous actor to bring attention to social and political issues, and she was known for her bravery and passion in standing up for what she believed in.</p><p>Today, Jean Seberg is remembered not only for her acting career but also for her activism and courage in the face of adversity. Her influence can be seen in the many artists and activists who continue to be inspired by her legacy.</p><p>Seberg's impact on the film industry and popular culture continues to be felt today. The iconic haircut she wore in "Breathless" became a defining style of the 1960s, and her fashion sense was admired by many. Seberg's dedication to civil rights also helped pave the way for future generations of activists, and her advocacy for women's reproductive rights was ahead of its time. After her death, Seberg's family established the Jean Seberg International Film Festival to honor her legacy and promote independent filmmaking. The festival has since become a leading showcase for emerging talent in the industry.</p><p>Seberg's tragic death at the age of 40 shocked the world and cast a pall over her legacy. However, her impact on the world of film and activism cannot be overstated. Today, she is remembered as a talented actor, a fearless activist, and a trailblazing feminist. Despite the struggles she faced in her personal life, Seberg remained a passionate advocate for what she believed in until the end. Her life and legacy continue to inspire new generations of artists, activists, and filmmakers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
