(December 23, 1763		Vienna-April 11, 1821			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
ophthalmology.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the founders of modern ophthalmology and is best known for his work on cataracts. Beer introduced a new method of cataract surgery, where the lens of the eye was extracted in one piece, rather than in fragments. He also invented various ophthalmic instruments including the "Beer hook" which is still used today in ophthalmic surgery. Beer was a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Vienna, and his teachings and innovations revolutionized the field of ophthalmology. He is also credited with introducing the use of electric light in ophthalmic examinations, which replaced the use of candles and oil lamps.</p><p></p><p>

(March 24, 1835		Klagenfurt-January 7, 1893			Vienna)

	
		a.k.a. Josef Stefan

	
was
an Austrian
physicist, mathematician and scientist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on thermal radiation, which led to the formulation of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This law states that the amount of energy radiated from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. Stefan's work on this law made it possible to calculate the temperature of stars based on their radiation.</p><p>Stefan obtained his PhD in physics from the University of Vienna in 1858 and later became a professor at the Vienna University of Technology. In addition to his work on thermal radiation, he also made contributions to the study of atomic spectra and the theory of elasticity. </p><p>In recognition of his contributions to science, the Stefan Medal was created by the Austrian Academy of Sciences in his honor.</p><p></p><p>

was
an Austrian
scientist.


					</p><p>Viktor Kaplan is primarily known for his invention of the Kaplan turbine, a propeller-type water turbine that is still widely used for generating electricity. Before this invention, turbines were not efficient enough to power electricity generation on a large scale. Kaplan's turbine enabled more efficient energy production from flowing water and helped accelerate the growth of hydroelectric power plants.</p><p>In addition to being a skilled engineer, Kaplan was also a talented artist and musician. He painted landscapes and played the violin and piano in his spare time. Despite being offered a professorship at the University of Vienna, he preferred to work as an independent researcher.</p><p>Kaplan's legacy in the field of hydroelectric power continues to this day, with the Kaplan turbine still being used in numerous power plants around the world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in stroke.
