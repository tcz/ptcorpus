							Serrador had a prolific career spanning over four decades, and was one of the most well-known actors in Chile during his time. He began his career in the 1930s, appearing in numerous films including "El HÃºsar de la Muerte" (The Death Hussar) and "Subterra" (The Underground). He also worked extensively in theater, starring in plays such as "La Casa de Bernarda Alba" (The House of Bernarda Alba) and "La Loca de Chaillot" (The Madwoman of Chaillot).</p><p>In addition to his acting work, Serrador was a prominent figure in Chilean cultural circles, and was involved in the founding of the National School of Dramatic Art in 1941. He was also an important influence on many young actors and filmmakers, and helped to shape the direction of Chilean cinema throughout his career.</p><p>Despite his significant contributions to the arts in Chile, Serrador's legacy has been somewhat overshadowed by his controversial political views. In the 1970s, he became involved with the far-right movement in Chile and was a supporter of the military coup that brought Augusto Pinochet to power. This has led to criticism of Serrador's work and his legacy in recent years.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=31018234" title="Wikipedia article about Esteban Serrador">Esteban Serrador on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/armenian-actors-died-at-age-70.html' title='Armenian actors died at age 70'><strong>Armenian actors died at age 70</strong> List of the top 1 Armenian actors who died when they were 70</a></li><li><a href='/british-actors-died-in-1982.html' title='British actors died in 1982'><strong>British actors died in 1982</strong> List of the top 19 British actors who died in 1982</a></li><li><a href='/british-actors-died-in-coronary-thrombosis.html' title='British actors died in Coronary thrombosis'><strong>British actors died in Coronary thrombosis</strong> List of the top 1 British actors who died in Coronary thrombosis</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/polish-actors-died-in-traffic-collision.html' title='Polish actors died in Traffic collision'><strong>Polish actors died in Traffic collision</strong> List of the top 2 Polish actors who died in Traffic collision</a></li><li><a href='/czech-actors-died-in-1995.html' title='Czech actors died in 1995'><strong>Czech actors died in 1995</strong> List of the top 2 Czech actors who died in 1995</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actors-died-in-infection.html' title='Indian actors died in Infection'><strong>Indian actors died in Infection</strong> List of the top 1 Indian actors who died in Infection</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
