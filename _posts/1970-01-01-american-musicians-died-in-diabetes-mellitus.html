		His children

						</p><p>Edison is most famously known for his invention of the practical incandescent light bulb, which revolutionized the way the world could be lit. He was a prolific inventor with over 1,000 patents to his name, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the alkaline storage battery. Edison was also the founder of the Edison Electric Light Company, which later merged with other companies to become General Electric. </p><p>Despite only having three months of formal education, Edison was a voracious reader and self-learner, and he had a passion for experimentation and innovation. He once said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." Edison was also known for his rigorous work ethic, often working 18 hours a day in his laboratory.</p><p>In addition to his many inventions, Edison was also a pioneer in the film industry. He built the first movie studio in West Orange, New Jersey in 1893 and produced more than 1,000 films. Edison received numerous honors during his lifetime, including the Congressional Gold Medal and induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. He passed away in 1931 at the age of 84.</p><p>Throughout his life, Thomas Edison held a number of influential positions. In 1888, he became a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and in the same year, he served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He also served as the first president of the Naval Consulting Board and as a consultant for the Panama Canal project.</p><p>Edison is often remembered for his famous feud with inventor Nikola Tesla over the best method for electrical power distribution, with Tesla advocating for alternating current and Edison promoting direct current. This dispute even led to Edison electrocuting animals publicly with alternating current to prove its dangers.</p><p>In his later years, Edison worked on developing a more natural rubber and on improving the storage battery, both of which ultimately proved unsuccessful. However, his contributions to science and technology continue to have a lasting impact on the world today.</p><p></p><p>
