(December 12, 1898		Shōdo Island-October 17, 1943)

	
		also known as Denji Kuroshima or Kuroshima Denji

	
was
a Japanese
writer.


					</p><p>He was widely recognized as one of the most important literary figures of the Japanese proletarian literary movement. Kuroshima was born in a farming village on Shōdo Island in the Seto Inland Sea. He moved to Tokyo in 1920, where he became involved in labor activism and began writing for the proletarian press. His best-known work is the novella "Shōnen Taiya" (Ragged Trousered Philanthropists) which was published in 1929. In the novella, Kuroshima describes the harsh living and working conditions of Japanese migrant workers in North America. His work often dealt with issues faced by the working class, such as poverty and inequality. Kuroshima's early death at age 44 was attributed to complications stemming from alcoholism. Despite his short life, Kuroshima made a lasting impact on Japanese literature, inspiring generations of writers to explore the struggles and triumphs of the working class.</p><p>Kuroshima's passion for writing began when he was still in his early teens. He was self-taught and avidly read socialist literature, which motivated him to participate in the labor movement. He joined the Proletarian Writers' Association in 1925, which gave him a platform to express his views and showcase his writing.</p><p>Apart from "Shōnen Taiya," Kuroshima is also known for his other notable works such as "Kanikōsen" (The Crab Cannery Ship), "Kokuhaku" (Confession) and "Mumyō no Hitobito" (People without a Name). These works also center around the struggles of the working class and the harsh realities of their everyday lives.</p><p>Kuroshima's writing style is characterized by its vivid descriptions, stark realism, and the empathy he showed towards the working class. He wrote with a clear intention to bring attention to the plight of those who were marginalized and forgotten by society. </p><p>Kuroshima's legacy lives on as his works continue to be read and studied as exemplars of proletarian literature. In 1946, a memorial monument was erected in the village where he was born, and his grave was designated as a national cultural asset by the Japanese government in 1999.</p><p></p><p>

(March 14, 1901-February 10, 1946)


was
a Japanese
writer.


					</p><p>Born in Tokyo, Mushitaro Oguri was the second son of a poet and newspaperman. He began his career as a writer in his early 20s, after dropping out of the literature department of Waseda University. Oguri was interested in social issues and often wrote about the working class and the poor. He became known for his use of colloquial Japanese in his writing, which made his work accessible to a wider audience.</p><p>One of Oguri's most popular works is "Waga machi" ("My Hometown"), a collection of short stories set in the working-class neighborhoods of Tokyo. His writing was heavily influenced by the proletarian literature movement of the 1920s and 30s, which sought to represent the struggles of the working class in literature.</p><p>During World War II, Oguri was drafted into the Japanese army and sent to China as a military correspondent. He later returned to Japan and began working for a newspaper. However, he soon became disillusioned with the state of Japanese society and politics, which had been devastated by the war. Oguri died of tuberculosis in 1946 at the age of 44. Despite his short career, he remains a highly regarded figure in Japanese literature.</p><p>Oguri was known for his prolific output and wrote novels, short stories, essays, and plays. One of his most famous plays, "Shusse no shingi" ("The Successive Principles of the Throne"), was a satirical commentary on the Japanese monarchy and its role in society. He also wrote about the experiences of women and the discrimination they faced in Japanese society.Oguri was a member of the Japanese Communist Party and his political beliefs were evident in his writing. He believed that literature had the power to improve society and fought for the rights of the working class until his death. After his passing, his work continued to inspire future generations of writers and activists in Japan.</p><p></p><p>

(November 29, 1815		Edo-March 24, 1860			Edo)


was
a Japanese
politician and daimyo.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Ii Naonori.

						</p><p>Ii Naosuke was a key figure during the late Edo period in Japan, serving as the 14th daimyo of the Hikone clan before becoming one of the key advisors to the shogun Tokugawa Iesada. Naosuke's political career was marked by his efforts to modernize Japan and open it to the outside world, even as many Japanese leaders resisted such changes. He was instrumental in negotiating the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Japan and the United States in 1858, which helped to pave the way for greater trade between these two nations. However, Naosuke's reforms and pro-foreign policies also made him a controversial figure, and he was assassinated in 1860 by a group of samurai who opposed his leadership. Despite his short life, Ii Naosuke played a crucial role in shaping Japan's modernization and opening to the world, and his legacy continues to be felt in contemporary Japan.</p><p>Naosuke was known for his pragmatic approach to politics and his willingness to embrace new ideas, both of which were relatively rare among the Japanese ruling class during his time. He recognized the necessity of modernizing Japan in order to compete with the Western powers and avoid being colonized or subjugated. In addition to negotiating the treaty with the United States, he also worked to establish relationships with other Western nations including Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands.</p><p>Naosuke's reforms included the creation of a centralized government, the building of new infrastructure such as roads and bridges, and the adoption of new technologies like steam power and telegraphy. He also supported the establishment of a modern navy and army, which would later play a key role in Japan's emergence as a major world power.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Naosuke remained a controversial figure in his own time and continues to be the subject of debate among historians today. Some see him as a visionary leader who played a crucial role in Japan's modernization, while others view him as a traitor who sold out his country to the Western powers. Regardless of one's interpretation, there is no denying the impact that Naosuke had on Japan and its history.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in assassination.

was
a Japanese
sumo wrestler.


					</p><p>Tanikaze Kajinosuke was a prominent sumo wrestler during the Edo period and was regarded as one of the greatest wrestlers of his time. He was born in Sendai and began his sumo career in 1769 at the age of 19. Within a few years, he gained popularity for his strength and technique, and by 1776, he was promoted to the top division of sumo, the makuuchi.</p><p>Tanikaze's rivalry with another great wrestler of his time, Raiden Tameemon, was legendary and attracted many spectators to sumo matches. Although Raiden was more muscular and larger in size than Tanikaze, the latter was known for his speed, agility, and quick reflexes. Tanikaze's signature move was the tsuppari, which involved consecutive thrusts to the opponent's chest.</p><p>After retiring from sumo in 1785, Tanikaze became an elder in the Japan Sumo Association and trained many successful wrestlers. However, his later years were plagued with financial problems, and he fell ill with influenza in 1795, ultimately leading to his death. Today, Tanikaze Kajinosuke is remembered as one of the most influential and skilled sumo wrestlers in Japanese history.</p><p>Despite his success in sumo wrestling, Tanikaze Kajinosuke was not born into a family with a sumo background. Instead, he worked as a servant for a sumo wrestler named Tanikaze, who would later become his mentor and adoptive father. Upon his mentor's retirement, Tanikaze Kajinosuke took on his name and adopted his family as his own. In his later years, he also became known for his calligraphy and poetry, and was a patron of the arts. He was known for his humility and generosity, and is said to have offered shelter and food to travelers passing through his village. Today, the Tanikaze stable in the Japan Sumo Association is named after him in honor of his contribution to the sport.</p><p></p><p>

His family survived the bombing but were relocated to a different part of Japan for safety. After completing his PhD, Okazaki spent time in the United States, training in the laboratory of Arthur Kornberg at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. It was here that Okazaki made the discovery that would define his career: the presence of short fragments of DNA that are synthesized discontinuously and later joined to form longer strands during DNA replication. </p><p>Upon returning to Japan, Okazaki continued his research at Nagoya University, where he served as a professor of biology. He also served as a visiting professor at Stanford University in California during the late 1960s, where he collaborated with biochemist Paul Berg on experiments related to DNA replication. </p><p>Despite his numerous accomplishments, Okazaki's life was cut tragically short when he passed away from lung cancer at age 44 in 1975. His legacy, however, has lived on. The so-called "Okazaki fragments" remain an important area of study for genetic researchers today, and the work that Okazaki did has paved the way for numerous advancements in the field of molecular biology.</p><p></p><p>
