(September 15, 1533		Innsbruck-February 28, 1572			Linz)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>Catherine was the daughter of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and Anna of Bohemia and Hungary. She was one of the most sought-after brides in Europe and was eventually married off to King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland in 1553, becoming Queen of Poland. </p><p>During her time as Queen, she supported the arts, science, education, and social reforms. She also acted as an intermediary between the Polish and Habsburg courts, which were often at odds. </p><p>Catherine was known for being intelligent, cultured, and multilingual. She was fluent in German, Polish, Latin, French, and Italian. She was also an accomplished musician and patron of the arts. </p><p>After her husband's death, Catherine returned to Austria and lived the rest of her life there. She died in 1572, aged 38.</p><p>During her time as Queen, Catherine of Austria played an active role in politics, which was unusual for a woman during that time. She formed an alliance with the powerful magnate families of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, such as the Radziwiłłs and the Zamoyskis, to consolidate her power and influence. Catherine's efforts helped to strengthen the ties between Poland and the Habsburg Empire, which were important for both countries in the face of growing threats from the Ottoman Empire.</p><p>Catherine was also a devoted mother and raised nine children. She was particularly close to her eldest son, the future King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Stephen Báthory. Catherine's daughter Anna Jagiellon married the future King of Poland, Stephen's successor, and her other daughter, Catherine, became the Queen of Sweden.</p><p>Today, Catherine of Austria is remembered as one of Poland's most influential queens and an important figure in European history. She helped to shape the cultural and political landscape of Poland during her reign and left a lasting impact on the country's history.</p><p>Catherine was known for her religious tolerance and advocated for the rights of religious minorities in Poland. She supported the Protestant Reformation and allowed the establishment of Protestant churches within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, she also worked to mediate between the different religious groups in Poland in order to avoid conflicts.</p><p>Catherine was also a strong advocate for education, particularly for women. She supported the establishment of schools and universities for women, which was quite progressive for the time. She was herself well-educated and believed that education was essential for women to become empowered and independent.</p><p>Despite her many achievements, Catherine's reign was not without challenges. She faced political opposition from some of the Polish nobility, who resented her power and influence. She also struggled with health problems throughout her life, which may have contributed to her early death.</p><p>Overall, Catherine of Austria was a remarkable woman who made significant contributions to the cultural and political life of Poland during her reign. Her legacy continues to be felt to this day, not only in Poland but throughout Europe.</p><p></p><p>

an Austrian
pilot.


					</p><p>Actually, Charles Kingsford Smith was an Australian pioneer aviator. He was born in Hamilton, Queensland (not Austria) on February 9, 1897, and died on November 8, 1935, in the Andaman Sea. Kingsford Smith was known for his aviation feats, including being the first pilot to fly across the Australian mainland and also the first person to fly from Australia to the United States. He was also famous for his record-breaking flights, such as the first non-stop flight from America to Australia, which he completed with his co-pilot Charles Ulm in 1928. Kingsford Smith was awarded numerous honors for his contributions to aviation, including the Air Force Cross and the Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE).</p><p>Kingsford Smith started his aviation career as a teenager by working as a mechanic and later joining the Australian Flying Corps during World War I. After the war, he started an airline in Australia named West Australian Airways and later, formed Australian National Airways. In 1930, he led a historic flight with his crew from England to Australia in a record time of just over 7 days. </p><p>Kingsford Smith's life was full of adventure and daring flights, but he met an unfortunate end when the plane he was flying disappeared over the Andaman Sea during a flight from England to Australia. Despite extensive search operations, his remains were never found. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures in Australian aviation history and is celebrated as a national hero.</p><p>Kingsford Smith's aviation career was not without its dangers and setbacks. He survived a number of crashes and near-disasters throughout his life, including a crash in the early days of his career that left him with a permanent limp. In 1933, he suffered a serious head injury in a crash and was hospitalized for several months. Despite these setbacks, however, he remained determined to push the boundaries of what was possible in aviation. Kingsford Smith was also a skilled navigator and inventor. In addition to pioneering long-distance flights, he invented a number of aviation instruments that are still in use today, such as the drift-meter and the artificial horizon. He was also a vocal advocate for the development of commercial air travel and believed that it was possible to create a global network of air routes that would revolutionize transportation. Kingsford Smith's legacy continues to inspire generations of pilots and aviation enthusiasts around the world.</p><p></p><p>
