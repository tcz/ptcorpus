(February 9, 1909		Florence-August 28, 1965			Florence)


was
an Israeli
mathematician and physicist.


					</p><p>He was best known for his work in quantum mechanics and group theory. Racah earned his doctorate in physics from the University of Florence in 1930 and went on to work at the University of Rome and the University of Palermo before moving to Israel in 1951. He was a professor of theoretical physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem until his death in 1965. In addition to his research in theoretical physics, Racah also worked on the history of Jewish contributions to science and mathematics. He was awarded the Israel Prize in 1960 for his contributions to the natural sciences.</p><p>Racah was born into an Italian-Jewish family of scholars and had a passion for mathematics from a very young age. His father, Adolfo Racah, was also a physicist and his mother, Emilia Lattes, was a classical scholar. Racah's early work focused on the application of group theory to atomic spectra and he developed a mathematical representation of the spectra, known as Racah-Wigner theory.</p><p>During World War II, Racah worked for the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary organization in Palestine, where he helped develop communication systems and military technology. After the war, he became active in the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission and worked on developing nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.</p><p>Racah's contributions to physics and mathematics have had a profound impact on the field. His work on quantum mechanics and group theory has provided the foundation for many important discoveries in physics and has influenced generations of scientists.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Racah was also deeply involved in Jewish scholarship and helped establish the National Library of Israel. He was a strong advocate for the integration of science and Jewish culture, and his work in this area has also had a significant impact on Jewish intellectual life.</p><p>Racah was a renowned and respected figure in the scientific community of his time. He was a member of the Royal Society of London and received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the Max Planck Medal in 1963. Racah's work on Racah polynomials, which are used in the study of atomic spectra and molecular vibrations, is still widely used today. Additionally, Racah was an active mentor and teacher, and his contributions to education have been lauded by many. He trained numerous students who went on to become leading physicists and mathematicians in their own right. Racah's legacy continues to inspire and influence scholars and researchers in diverse fields to this day.</p><p></p><p>
