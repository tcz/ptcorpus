In 1954, he was ordained as a priest and joined the Maryknoll order, which specializes in missionary work in developing countries.</p><p>After his arrival in Honduras, Carney became a vocal critic of the oppressive government regime and its treatment of the poor and marginalized. He worked alongside peasant farmers to establish co-ops and other grassroots organizations aimed at improving their living conditions. He was also a vocal opponent of American military intervention in Central America, which he saw as damaging to the region's democratic aspirations.</p><p>Carney's decision to join the guerrilla forces was hotly debated among his fellow missionaries and human rights advocates, but he remained steadfast in his commitment to social justice. His death was a significant blow to the cause, but his legacy has continued to inspire generations of activists fighting for justice and equality in Honduras and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
