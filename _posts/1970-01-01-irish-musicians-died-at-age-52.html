									</h1><p>Here are 11 famous musicians from Republic of Ireland died at 52:</p><h2>Brian Lenihan, Jr.</h2><p><strong>Brian Lenihan, Jr.</strong>
(May 21, 1959		Dublin-June 10, 2011)

	
		a.k.a. Brian Joseph Lenihan

	
was
an Irish
politician and barrister.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Claire Lenihan and Tom Lenihan.

						</p><p>Lenihan served as the Minister for Finance in Ireland from 2008 until 2011, during the country's financial crisis. He played a significant role in negotiating the international bailout of Ireland in November 2010. Prior to his appointment as Minister for Finance, Lenihan held various ministerial positions, including Minister for Justice and Minister for Children. He was a member of the Fianna Fáil party and was first elected to the Dáil Éireann, the Irish parliament, in 1996 in a by-election. Throughout his political career, Lenihan was known as a charismatic and effective communicator, earning him a reputation as one of the rising stars of Irish politics. He is remembered for his contributions to Irish politics, particularly during the country's financial crisis.</p><p>Lenihan was born into a political family - his father, Brian Lenihan Sr., was a prominent politician in Ireland, serving as Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) and Minister for Foreign Affairs. Lenihan followed in his father's footsteps, becoming active in politics while studying law at Trinity College Dublin. After graduation, he worked as a barrister before entering politics full-time.</p><p>One of Lenihan's major achievements as Minister for Finance was a restructuring of the Irish banking system, which had been severely impacted by the global financial crisis. Along with other government officials, Lenihan was criticized by some for the level of government intervention in the banking sector, which some saw as a violation of free market principles. However, Lenihan defended the government's actions as necessary to prevent a complete financial collapse in Ireland.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Lenihan was a noted writer and historian, publishing several books on Irish history and politics. He was also known for his love of Gaelic football, and was a regular spectator and commentator on the sport. Despite his untimely death, Lenihan's legacy continues in Ireland, where he is remembered as one of the most talented and dedicated politicians of his generation.</p><p>Lenihan's contributions to Irish politics were not only limited to his role as Minister for Finance. He was also instrumental in the campaign for marriage equality in Ireland, publicly supporting the movement and urging his fellow citizens to vote in favor of the referendum in 2015. Lenihan's open support for LGBT rights was seen as particularly significant given the conservative stance of his own political party on the issue.</p><p>Lenihan's death in 2011 was met with widespread sorrow and tributes from across the political spectrum in Ireland. His funeral was attended by thousands, and he was posthumously awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin for his service to the city and to the country at large. In the years since his passing, Lenihan's legacy has continued to inspire a new generation of Irish politicians, many of whom credit him with influencing their own decisions to enter public service.</p><p></p><p>
