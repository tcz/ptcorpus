(April 24, 1903		Madrid-November 20, 1936			Alicante)

	
		also known as Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera

	
was
a Spanish
politician and lawyer.


					</p><p>He was the founder of the political organization Falange Española, which aimed to create a fascist regime in Spain. Primo de Rivera was deeply involved in Spanish politics, and served as a member of the Spanish Parliament from 1933 until his arrest in 1936. He was a staunch supporter of the Spanish Nationalist movement, which sought to overthrow the democratically-elected government of Spain during the Spanish Civil War. </p><p>Despite his political ambitions, Primo de Rivera was also a prolific writer and poet. He published several books during his lifetime, including "El Fascismo" and "La Conquista del Estado". His poetry was often lauded for its powerful imagery and evocative language. However, his political activities overshadowed his literary contributions, and his legacy is often associated with his controversial fascist ideologies.</p><p>Primo de Rivera's life was cut short when he was arrested by the Spanish Republican authorities in 1936, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. He was charged with attempting to overthrow the government and executed by firing squad in Alicante later that year. Despite his controversial legacy, Primo de Rivera remains a highly divisive figure in Spanish history, revered by some as a martyr and condemned by others as a fascist tyrant.</p><p>Primo de Rivera was the eldest son of Spanish military dictator, Miguel Primo de Rivera, and grew up in a privileged environment. He studied law at the Central University of Madrid and later joined the Spanish Conservative Party. However, he became disillusioned with traditional political parties and founded the Falange Española in 1933, which espoused fascist ideologies and aimed to create a one-party state in Spain. </p><p>Primo de Rivera was heavily influenced by the fascist movements in Italy and Germany and sought to modernize Spain's political system by introducing authoritarianism and nationalistic sentiments. His speeches often praised Spain's military past and emphasized the need for a strong government to restore order and unity in the country. </p><p>Despite his controversial political ideologies, Primo de Rivera had a strong following among young Spaniards who were disillusioned with the perceived inefficiencies of democracy. He was also a gifted orator and his speeches often drew large crowds. </p><p>Primo de Rivera's execution in 1936 marked the end of his political aspirations, but his legacy continued to impact Spanish politics for years to come. The Falange Española merged with other right-wing groups to form the Nationalist Party, which went on to win the Spanish Civil War in 1939, establishing a fascist dictatorship under General Francisco Franco. Although Primo de Rivera did not live to see his political goals realized, his fascist ideologies played a significant role in shaping Spain's political landscape during the early 20th century.</p><p>Primo de Rivera was not only involved in politics and literature but also had a passion for music. He was a skilled pianist and composer, and his music was heavily influenced by his political ideologies. Primo de Rivera believed that music could be used as a tool for propaganda and sought to promote fascist values through his compositions. One of his most famous works, "Himno de la Falange," became the official hymn of the Falange Española and was widely played during their rallies and meetings. Primo de Rivera's musical contributions continued to inspire fascist movements in Spain and other countries for years to come. In addition to his artistic pursuits, Primo de Rivera was also known for his personal life. He married his wife, Carmen Polo, in 1934 and they had four children together. Despite his political ambitions and controversial legacy, Primo de Rivera was known to be a devoted family man who loved spending time with his children.</p><p></p><p>
