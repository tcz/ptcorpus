Brün was also a prolific writer and published several essays on music theory and composition. His book "The Practice of Musical Composition" is still used as a textbook in music schools today. Brün's legacy continues to influence the world of electronic music and sound art, and his innovative approach to composition and technology has inspired many contemporary musicians and artists.
