						</p><p>Shulman studied at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore and later at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He began his career as a cellist, playing in various orchestras including the New York City Opera and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Shulman later turned to composition and his works were performed by many notable orchestras including the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He also wrote music for films and television, including scores for the classic TV series "The Twilight Zone". Later in life, Shulman became a prominent teacher and mentor, serving on the faculty at the Manhattan School of Music for many years.</p><p>Shulman's compositions were influenced by a variety of styles, including jazz, folk, and classical music. He was known for his use of unique instrumental combinations and his incorporation of innovative rhythms and harmonies in his pieces. Some of his notable works include his cello concerto, string quartet, and "A Laurentian Overture". Shulman was honored with numerous awards throughout his career, including the ASCAP Deems Taylor Award and the National Endowment for the Arts Grant.

In an interview, he once said, "I've made some contributions, but they're drops in the ocean. The great contributions come from people like Bach and Beethoven, and I don't put myself in their category at all." Nevertheless, he remains an important figure in the world of American classical music and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of composers and performers.</p><p>Shulman also had a strong passion for music education and was involved in numerous programs throughout his career.

Shulman believed that music education was crucial in developing the next generation of musicians and composers, and he dedicated much of his time and energy to this cause.Shulman's legacy in music is further solidified by the Alan Shulman Award, which is given out each year by the Manhattan School of Music to an outstanding composition student. The award was established in his honor and serves as a testament to his many contributions to the field of music. In addition to his prestigious career, Shulman is remembered for his kindness, generosity, and unwavering dedication to his craft.</p><p></p><p>
