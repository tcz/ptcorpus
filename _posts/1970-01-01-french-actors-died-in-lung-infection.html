							Born in Chile, Ruiz initially pursued a career in theology before turning to filmmaking. He gained recognition in the 1960s for his avant-garde and experimental films, which were heavily influenced by Surrealism and the French New Wave. In 1973, following the military coup d'état in Chile, Ruiz was forced to flee the country and eventually settled in Paris, where he continued to make films and became a prominent figure in the French film industry. </p><p>Over the course of his career, Ruiz directed over 100 films, ranging from experimental shorts to feature-length narratives. His films often featured complex, non-linear narratives and explored themes of memory, identity, and the nature of reality. Some of his most notable films include "Three Lives and Only One Death," "Time Regained," and "The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting." Ruiz's unique and boundary-pushing approach to filmmaking has earned him a place as one of the most influential filmmakers of his generation.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=4908277" title="Wikipedia article about Raúl Ruiz">Raúl Ruiz on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/venezuelan-musicians-died-at-age-35.html' title='Venezuelan musicians died at age 35'><strong>Venezuelan musicians died at age 35</strong> List of the top 1 Venezuelan music stars who died when they were 35</a></li><li><a href='/brazilian-actors-died-in-2009.html' title='Brazilian actors died in 2009'><strong>Brazilian actors died in 2009</strong> List of the top 2 Brazilian actors who died in 2009</a></li><li><a href='/russian-actors-died-in-drug-overdose.html' title='Russian actors died in Drug overdose'><strong>Russian actors died in Drug overdose</strong> List of the top 1 Russian actors who died in Drug overdose</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/canadian-actresses-died-at-age-61.html' title='Canadian actresses died at age 61'><strong>Canadian actresses died at age 61</strong> List of the top 2 Canadian actresses who died when they were 61</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-horse-riding-accident.html' title='Famous actors died in Horse-riding accident'><strong>Famous actors died in Horse-riding accident</strong> List of the top 2 Famous actors who died in Horse-riding accident</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-at-age-37.html' title='Famous actors died at age 37'><strong>Famous actors died at age 37</strong> List of the top 6 Famous actors who died when they were 37</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
