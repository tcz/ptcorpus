					</p><p>He is best known for his epic work, the Cities of Salt quintet, which chronicles the transformation of the Arabian Peninsula as a result of the discovery and exploitation of oil. Munif was born in Jordan, but spent most of his life in Iraq and later in exile in France and Syria. He was a vocal critic of the authoritarian regimes in his home country of Iraq and throughout the Middle East, and his work often explored themes of power, corruption, and injustice. In addition to his novels, Munif also wrote essays and political analyses, and was a contributor to various Arabic-language newspapers and magazines.

Munif passed away in Damascus in 2004.</p><p>Munif was born into a well-educated family and received his early education in Jordan before moving to Baghdad to study at Baghdad University. He later earned a PhD in oil economics from the University of Belgrade in Yugoslavia. After completing his studies, Munif worked for the Iraqi Petroleum Company for a number of years before resigning in protest over the company's exploitation of Iraq's oil resources.</p><p>Munif's literary career began in the 1960s with the publication of his first novel, "The End of a Brave New World." But it was his critically acclaimed and hugely popular "Cities of Salt" series that gained him international recognition as one of the leading writers of the Arab world.</p><p>Despite facing censorship and political persecution throughout his career, Munif continued to write and publish, and was known for his uncompromising critique of governments in the Middle East. He was forced to flee Iraq after the Baathist regime took power in the 1960s, and later settled in France, where he became an outspoken critic of Saddam Hussein's regime.</p><p>In addition to his literary contributions, Munif was also a respected political figure and advocate, playing an active role in the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and supporting other revolutionary movements in the Arab world. His work has had a lasting impact on Arabic literature, and his influence can still be felt in the works of many contemporary Arab writers.</p><p></p><p>
