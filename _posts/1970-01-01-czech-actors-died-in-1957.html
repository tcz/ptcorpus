actor and film director.



						</p><p>During his career, Vladimír Majer appeared in more than 80 films and also directed a few films in the 1930s. He was particularly known for his work in the genre of Czech comedy films, and was a frequent collaborator of the famous Czech screenwriter and director Karel Lamac. Majer began his acting career in the early 1910s and became a prominent figure in Czech cinema in the 1920s and 30s. He was also a respected theatre actor and worked at various theatres in Prague throughout his career. Despite his success in the film industry, he remained loyal to the theatre and continued to perform on stage until his death in 1957. Majer was married to the Czech actress and singer Anny Ondráková, who also had a successful career in Hollywood.</p><p>Majer and Ondráková collaborated on several films, including the 1925 silent film "Karel Havlíček Borovský", which was directed by Karel Lamac. Majer's other notable films include "Bohemia's Treasure" (1921), "The Girl in the Cupboard" (1929), and "The Merry Wives" (1934). He also appeared in several films during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, which drew criticism from some in the Czech film industry after the war. However, despite these controversies, Majer remains one of the most prominent actors and directors of Czech cinema in the early 20th century. In addition to his work in film and theatre, he was also a voice actor and worked on several radio dramas in the 1930s and 40s. Majer passed away in Prague in 1957 at the age of 65, leaving behind a lasting legacy in Czech culture and on the silver screen.</p><p>Throughout his career, Majer was highly acclaimed for his comedic timing and his ability to bring a sense of lightheartedness to his roles. He was praised for his versatility as an actor and his ability to seamlessly transition from comedic to dramatic roles. In addition to his work on stage and screen, he also wrote several film scripts and was involved in the production of several films. Majer's influence on Czech cinema can still be seen today, as his work continues to be studied and celebrated by film scholars and cinephiles alike. His contributions to the Czech entertainment industry were recognized posthumously in 1960, when he was awarded the Order of Merit by the Czechoslovak government. In Prague, there is a street named after him in recognition of his legacy.</p><p>In addition to his acting and directing career, Vladimír Majer was also known for his activism in the Czech film industry. In the early 1930s, he co-founded the Czechoslovak Film Actors' Association, which advocated for the rights and working conditions of actors. He also served as the chairman of the association for a period of time. During the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, Majer risked his own safety by using his position in the film industry to secretly help his Jewish colleagues and friends. He used his connections and influence to provide them with false papers and refuge, and helped them flee the country to escape persecution. This bravery and compassion for others earned him the respect and admiration of many in the Czech film community. </p><p>Majer's personal life was also marked by tragedy. He and his wife, Anny Ondráková, lost their only child, a son named Vladimír Jr., in a tragic accident in 1936. The loss of their son was a devastating blow to the couple, and it reportedly had a profound impact on their relationship. Despite this, they remained married until Majer's death in 1957. </p><p>Today, Vladimír Majer is remembered as one of the greatest actors and directors in Czech cinema history. His legacy continues to influence and inspire new generations of filmmakers and performers.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/israeli-actors-born-in-1947.html' title='Israeli actors born in 1947'><strong>Israeli actors born in 1947</strong> List of the top 6 Israeli actors who were born in 1947</a></li><li><a href='/thai-actors-died-in-2011.html' title='Thai actors died in 2011'><strong>Thai actors died in 2011</strong> List of the top 1 Thai actors who died in 2011</a></li><li><a href='/indonesian-actors-died-in-1968.html' title='Indonesian actors died in 1968'><strong>Indonesian actors died in 1968</strong> List of the top 2 Indonesian actors who died in 1968</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/japanese-actors-born-in-1943.html' title='Japanese actors born in 1943'><strong>Japanese actors born in 1943</strong> List of the top 12 Japanese actors who were born in 1943</a></li><li><a href='/french-musicians-died-in-laryngeal-cancer.html' title='French musicians died in Laryngeal Cancer'><strong>French musicians died in Laryngeal Cancer</strong> List of the top 1 French music stars who died in Laryngeal Cancer</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-at-age-75.html' title='Famous musicians died at age 75'><strong>Famous musicians died at age 75</strong> List of the top 26 Famous music stars who died when they were 75</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
