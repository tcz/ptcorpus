(March 12, 1908		Hastings-January 25, 1970			Wellington)


was
a New Zealand
personality.


					</p><p>She was a prominent painter, best known for her portraits, landscapes and still life paintings which are celebrated for their precise lines, bold colors and simplicity. Angus was a key figure in the modernist movement in New Zealand art and her works have been exhibited extensively in various galleries and museums across the world. In addition to her contributions to the art world, she was also a vocal advocate for social and political causes and actively participated in various political movements throughout her life.</p><p>Despite facing several challenges in her personal life, such as struggling with mental illness and financial difficulties, Rita Angus continued to create groundbreaking works of art that have left a lasting impact on New Zealand's artistic legacy. Some of her most iconic paintings include "Cass", which depicts the Southern Alps, and "Self-Portrait", a strikingly powerful representation of the artist herself. In recognition of her contributions to the arts, several accolades and awards have been named after her, including the Rita Angus Residency, which provides opportunities for artists to work and live in Wellington, the city where she spent most of her life.</p><p>Rita Angus grew up in a strict Presbyterian household in the town of Napier. Despite her father's disapproval of her artistic pursuits, Angus attended the Canterbury College School of Art in Christchurch and later the Dunedin School of Art. Her early works were heavily influenced by European modernist styles, particularly the works of French artist Paul Gauguin.</p><p>In the 1930s, Angus became involved with left-wing political and intellectual circles in Wellington, and her art began to reflect her social and political concerns. During World War II, she worked as a graphic designer for the New Zealand government, creating propaganda posters and other materials.</p><p>After the war, Angus traveled to Europe, where she was exposed to the works of modernist artists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Her paintings from this period, such as 'Central Otago', combine her earlier interest in New Zealand landscapes with the flattened perspectives and bold colors of European modernism.</p><p>Despite struggling with mental illness throughout her life, Angus continued to paint and exhibit her works until her death in 1970. Today, she is widely regarded as one of New Zealand's most important modernist artists, and her works can be found in museums and private collections throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>
