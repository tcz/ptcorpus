In addition to his highly physical and acrobatic style of clowning, Grock was also a talented musician and composer, and would often incorporate music into his performances. He composed over 50 pieces of music, many of which were popular hits in Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. Grock was also a published author, and wrote several books about his life and experiences as a clown. Despite his success, he remained humble and always considered himself a clown first and foremost. He retired in the 1950s, and spent the remainder of his life in a villa in Imperia, Italy, where he passed away in 1959 at the age of 79.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=20782097" title="Wikipedia article about Grock">Grock on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Emil Hegetschweiler</h2><p><strong>Emil Hegetschweiler</strong>
