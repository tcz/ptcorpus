							Julián de Meriche was born Vladimir Lipkies Chazan in Russia and immigrated to Mexico in the 1920s. He is best known for his work in Mexican cinema and his contributions to popularizing Latin American dance in the United States. De Meriche began his dance career in the 1920s and went on to form his own dance troupe, known as Julien de Meriche y su Conjunto. After achieving success in Mexico, he moved to New York City in the 1930s where he gained wider recognition for his choreography in Hollywood films and Broadway productions. Some of his film credits include "Ziegfeld Girl" (1941), "Yolanda and the Thief" (1945), and "The Kissing Bandit" (1948). In addition to his work in cinema, de Meriche also founded dance schools and worked to promote Latin American dance throughout the United States. He continued to perform and teach dance well into his seventies.
