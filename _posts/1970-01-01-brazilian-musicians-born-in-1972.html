Falaschi joined Angra in 2001 and recorded four studio albums with the band, including Temple of Shadows and Aurora Consurgens.

Falaschi left Angra in 2012 to focus on his solo career and other musical projects. In addition to his work as a musician, Falaschi is also an actor and has appeared in several Brazilian films and TV shows. He remains an influential figure in the Brazilian metal scene and has earned praise for his powerful vocals and dynamic stage presence.</p><p>Falaschi was interested in music from a young age and began singing at the age of 14. Prior to joining Angra, he was a member of several other bands, including Mitrium and Symbols. In 2006, he also joined the Brazilian progressive rock band Almah, for which he has released several albums. </p><p>Aside from his musical career, Falaschi is also a dedicated activist for environmental and social causes. He has worked with organizations such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International to raise awareness and funds for these issues.</p><p>In 2016, Falaschi formed the Edu Falaschi Rebirth of Shadows Tour, a project that celebrates the music of Angra and features other former members of the band. The project has toured extensively throughout Brazil and other parts of South America, and has been well-received by fans of the band.</p><p>Throughout his career, Falaschi has collaborated with several other notable artists in the metal scene, including Tobias Sammet of Edguy and Avantasia, and Kai Hansen of Helloween and Gamma Ray. He has also been a guest vocalist on albums by other bands such as Kamelot and Genius Rock Opera. </p><p>In addition to his music and acting career, Falaschi is also an entrepreneur and has his own production company called Inner Galaxy Records. The company focuses on producing and promoting Brazilian metal bands and has been responsible for launching the careers of several up-and-coming artists in the genre. </p><p>Falaschi's voice has been praised for its versatility and range, with critics noting his ability to seamlessly transition between high-pitched screams and melodic singing. He has won several awards for his vocals, including the Best Vocalist award at the Brazilian Metal Awards in 2003 and 2011. </p><p>Despite being involved in the music industry for over two decades, Falaschi shows no signs of slowing down and continues to be an active performer and advocate for social and environmental causes.</p><p>In addition to his work with Almah and the Edu Falaschi Rebirth of Shadows Tour, Falaschi has also released several solo albums. His debut solo release, Almah, was released in 2006 and featured a more progressive rock sound than his work with Angra. He followed this up with the album Aurora Consurgens, which was heavily influenced by his experiences touring with Angra. In 2018, Falaschi released his third solo album, The Glory of the Sacred Truth, which featured guest appearances by several other prominent Brazilian metal musicians.</p><p>Falaschi is also known for his philanthropic work, particularly in his efforts to raise awareness about the dangers of single-use plastic waste. In 2019, he released the song "The Silent Force" in collaboration with environmental organization Sea Shepherd, with all of the proceeds from the song going towards their efforts to protect marine life.</p><p>Despite his numerous musical and entrepreneurial ventures, Falaschi remains dedicated to his family life. He is married with two children and often speaks about the importance of balancing his busy career with spending time with his loved ones.</p><p>Falaschi's musical influences include a variety of artists and genres, ranging from classical music to heavy metal. He has cited Queen, Iron Maiden, and Deep Purple as some of his biggest inspirations, as well as Brazilian musicians Milton Nascimento and Elis Regina. His diverse range of influences is reflected in his own music, which often blends multiple genres and styles together.</p><p>Falaschi is also an avid reader and has cited authors such as J.R.R. Tolkien and Paulo Coelho as some of his favorites. He has used elements from literature and mythology in his songwriting, particularly in Angra's album Temple of Shadows which is based on the character of the knight Saladin and his quest for the Holy Grail.</p><p>In recent years, Falaschi has become more involved in music education and has given vocal workshops and masterclasses across Brazil and other parts of the world. He has also served as a judge for vocal competitions such as the Brazilian edition of The Voice.</p><p>Despite facing some health issues throughout his career, including a vocal cord nodule that required surgery in 2014, Falaschi has persevered and continued to make music that resonates with fans around the world.
