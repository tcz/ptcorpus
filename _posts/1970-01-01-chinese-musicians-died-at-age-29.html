Huang Yong was eventually sentenced to death in 2004, but his case continues to be a controversial topic in China.</p><p>Huang Yong's case also brought attention to the issue of corruption within the Chinese healthcare system, as many doctors were found to be accepting bribes or charging exorbitant fees for their services.
