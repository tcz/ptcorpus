(January 25, 1824		Jessore District-June 29, 1873			Kolkata)

	
		also known as Michael Madhusudan Dutta

	
was
a Bangladeshi
poet, writer and playwright.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the pioneers of modern Bengali literature and is best known for his epic poem, "Meghnad Badh Kavya". Dutt was born in what is now Bangladesh and grew up in a family of landlords. He was educated in English and Bengali and later studied law in Kolkata.</p><p>Dutt began his literary career writing in English, but later switched to Bengali after realizing its potential as a literary language. His writing was heavily influenced by Western literature and he was known for his experimentation with form and language.</p><p>In addition to his literary pursuits, Dutt was also involved in political and social activism. He was opposed to British colonialism and was a strong advocate for women's rights.</p><p>Dutt's works continue to be studied and celebrated today for their contribution to Bengali literature and his significant role in shaping the language's literary identity.</p><p>Dutt's personal life was marked by tragedy and upheaval. He had a tumultuous marriage, and after his wife's death, he converted to Christianity and took a second wife. This caused a scandal in conservative Bengali society and led to his rejection by many of his former friends and colleagues. Despite this, Dutt continued to write and publish prolifically, producing works in a wide range of genres, including poetry, drama, and prose. He also translated a number of works from English into Bengali, including Shakespeare's plays and Milton's Paradise Lost. Dutt's legacy as a literary innovator and cultural icon endures to this day, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in Bengali literature.</p><p>Dutt's magnum opus, "Meghnad Badh Kavya", is a retelling of the Ramayana from the perspective of Ravana's son, Meghnad. The poem, which is over 1,000 stanzas long, is noted for its innovative use of language, blending Sanskrit and Bengali words and phrases in a way that had never been done before. Its complex themes and rich symbolism have made it a subject of study in literary circles around the world.</p><p>Despite his contributions to Bengali literature, Dutt struggled financially throughout his life. He was often forced to rely on the patronage of wealthy friends and supporters to continue his work. He even had to sell his house at one point to pay off his debts.</p><p>Tragically, Dutt died at the relatively young age of 49, leaving behind a wife and six children. Today, his legacy is celebrated in Bangladesh and West Bengal with museums and memorials dedicated to his life and work. His contribution to Bengali literature and his dedication to social justice continue to inspire generations of writers and activists.</p><p>Dutt was born into a Hindu Brahmin family and was given the name "Madhusudan" at birth, but later added "Michael" to his name after converting to Christianity. He was a man of many contradictions, blending Eastern and Western cultural influences in his work and leading a life that often defied traditional societal norms. Despite this, Dutt remained committed to his artistic and political ideals throughout his life. In addition to his literary achievements, he was also a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement and was involved in various social reform movements aimed at improving the lives of disadvantaged communities. Today, his contributions to Bengali literature and his advocacy for social justice continue to inspire people throughout the world.</p><p>Dutt's pioneering role in Bengali literature has earned him numerous accolades, including the title of "The father of Bengali sonnet". His work transcended national boundaries and inspired generations of writers and readers both within and outside of the Bengali-speaking world. His influence can be seen in the works of many Bengali writers who followed in his footsteps, including Rabindranath Tagore, who considered Dutt to be one of his greatest literary influences. Dutt's innovative approach to language and form has also had a lasting impact on the wider literary world, with many critics seeing him as a precursor to the modernist movement in literature. Despite his enduring legacy, Dutt's life was marked by tragedy and hardship. He struggled with financial difficulties and illness throughout his life and was often forced to rely on the generosity of others to support his work. Nevertheless, he remained dedicated to his craft and his beliefs until the very end, leaving behind a rich and enduring legacy that continues to inspire and captivate readers to this day.</p><p></p><p>
