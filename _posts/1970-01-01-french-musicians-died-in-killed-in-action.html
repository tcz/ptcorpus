						Jaubert's career in law, though successful, was cut short by his passion for music. He began composing for films in the 1920s and gained recognition for his scores in classic French films, such as "L'Atalante" and "The Rules of the Game". He was known for melding different genres into his compositions, including jazz, classical, and folk music. In addition to his film work, he also composed chamber music, operas, and ballets. Sadly, Jaubert's life was cut short at the young age of 40 when he was killed in action during World War II.
