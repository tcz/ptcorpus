(June 12, 1893		Havana-December 4, 1950			Havana)


was
a Cuban
film score composer.


					</p><p>He is known for his work in the golden age of Cuban cinema during the 1940s and 1950s. A talented pianist, Grenet was also a prolific composer who wrote more than 300 works during his career, including music for film and theater, as well as popular songs. Some of his most famous compositions include "El Manisero" and "Negra Consentida." Grenet was a member of the Sociedad de Autores y Compositores de Música (SACM), an organization that promotes the rights of composers and authors in Cuba. His contributions to Cuban music and film continue to be celebrated today.</p><p>In addition to his success as a composer, Eliseo Grenet was also an accomplished pianist and bandleader. He began his musical career performing in Havana's famed Tropicana nightclub in the 1920s, and later formed his own band, which played at venues throughout Cuba and Latin America. In the 1930s, Grenet began composing music for film and theater productions, and quickly became one of the most sought-after composers in Cuba's burgeoning film industry. Some of his most notable film scores include those for the films "Rincón Criollo" (1949) and "Cecilia Valdés" (1951). Grenet's music was also an important part of Cuba's cultural diplomacy efforts during the mid-20th century, and he frequently toured abroad to perform and promote Cuban music. Despite his success, Grenet struggled with health issues throughout his life and passed away at the age of 57. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of Cuban music and cinema.</p><p></p><p>
