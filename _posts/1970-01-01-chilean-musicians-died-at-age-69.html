(June 8, 1910		Viña del Mar-May 6, 1980)

	
		a.k.a. Maria Luisa Bombal

	
was
a Chilean
writer.


					</p><p>She was one of the most prominent female Latin American authors of the 20th century and is known for her innovative use of stream-of-consciousness narrative style. Bombal's work often explored themes of desire, love, and loss, and was deeply influenced by her own experiences as a woman in a patriarchal society. She published several collections of short stories and two novels, including her best-known work, "La última niebla" (The Final Fog), in 1935. Throughout her career, Bombal was recognized with numerous literary awards and honors, and her work continues to be celebrated for its lyrical prose and its contribution to the Latin American literary canon.</p><p>In addition to her prolific writing career, María Luisa Bombal was also interested in the arts and culture. She was a talented artist, exhibiting her surrealist paintings in Chile and Europe. Bombal also spent time in Paris in the 1930s, where she studied music and theater, further expanding her creative pursuits. Later in life, she worked as a journalist and contributed to several newspapers, including the prestigious El Mercurio. Despite facing criticism from some male critics who dismissed her work as overly emotional or overly feminine, Bombal's writing has had a lasting impact on Latin American literature, and her contributions continue to be appreciated and studied by literary scholars and readers worldwide.</p><p>In 1942, María Luisa Bombal married Jorge Larraín, with whom she had two children. The couple frequently traveled together, and Bombal often gathered inspiration for her writing from her experiences abroad. However, their marriage was tumultuous, and they eventually separated in 1950. Bombal continued to write and publish throughout her life, but her later works received less attention than her earlier successes. In addition to her literary achievements, Bombal was also a feminist and an advocate for women's rights. She spoke out against the patriarchal structures of Chilean society and was involved in the Women's National Institute. María Luisa Bombal's legacy lives on today, with her work still being read and studied by those interested in Latin American literature and feminism.</p><p></p><p>
