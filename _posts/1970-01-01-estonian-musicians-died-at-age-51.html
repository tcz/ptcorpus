(April 5, 1786		Tallinn-July 25, 1837)


was
an Estonian
diplomat.


					</p><p>He began his career as a translator and assistant to the Russian Ambassador in Turkey in 1812. From 1815 to 1822, he served as the Consul General of the Russian Empire in Bucharest, Romania. Schilling's most notable achievement in this position was his successful negotiation of a commercial treaty between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. In 1822, he was appointed Russian Consul General in the Principality of Moldavia, where he served until 1828. During his time in Moldavia, Schilling worked to improve economic and cultural ties between Russia and the principality. He was especially interested in improving the lot of the local Jewish community, and worked to ease their legal and economic burdens. After his service in Moldavia, Schilling returned to Russia and worked as a translator in the office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He died in Saint Petersburg in 1837.</p><p>Schilling's diplomatic skills and work ethic were recognized by his superiors, and he was awarded the Order of St. Anna in 1826 for his service in Moldavia. He was also an accomplished linguist, fluent in several languages including Turkish, Romanian, French, and German. In addition to his diplomatic work, Schilling was an avid scholar and wrote several articles on linguistics, history, and economics. His most well-known work is a treatise on the history and culture of Moldavia, which he published in 1825. Schilling's legacy is still felt in Estonia and Moldova today, where he is remembered as a trailblazer in international diplomacy and a champion of human rights.</p><p>Schilling's influence was not only limited to diplomatic and cultural relations, but he also played an important role in the development of education in Estonia. In 1823, he founded the Tallinn Teachers' Seminar, which was later transformed into the Tallinn Teacher Training Institute. The institute became a hub for promoting education and teacher training in Estonia, and Schilling's efforts helped to modernize the country's educational system. Additionally, Schilling was involved in the establishment of the first Estonian newspaper, the Tallinna Saksa ja Eesti Käibekirjas, which was launched in 1821. His dedication to promoting education and freedom of press earned him respect and admiration from the Estonian community. Today, Schilling is recognized as one of Estonia's most notable figures in the fields of diplomacy, education, and culture.</p><p></p><p>
