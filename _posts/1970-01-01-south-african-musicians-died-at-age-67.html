									</h1><p>Here are 25 famous musicians from South Africa died at 67:</p><h2>Bram Fischer</h2><p><strong>Bram Fischer</strong>
(April 23, 1908		Bloemfontein-May 8, 1975)

	
		also known as Braam Fischer

	
was
a South African
lawyer and advocate.


					</p><p>Fischer was born into a prominent Afrikaner family, and his father was a famous judge who served on the South African bench. Bram Fischer eventually followed in his father's footsteps and became a prominent lawyer, but he is best known for his political activism. </p><p>Fischer was a member of the South African Communist Party and a leading figure in the African National Congress (ANC). He played a key role in shaping the ANC's resistance against apartheid, and he defended many anti-apartheid activists in court. </p><p>In 1964, Fischer was arrested and charged with sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government. He was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment on Robben Island, where he spent the next 13 years of his life. While in prison, Fischer remained a vocal opponent of apartheid and continued to advocate for democracy and human rights.</p><p>Fischer was released from prison in 1975 due to his declining health, but he died later that year at the age of 67. He is remembered as a hero of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa and is widely respected for his unwavering commitment to justice and equality.</p><p>Fischer's commitment to the anti-apartheid cause had a profound impact on his personal life as well. Despite being born into a privileged white Afrikaner family, he dedicated his life to fighting against the racist system of white minority rule. This put him at odds with many of his family and friends, who saw him as a traitor to their way of life. Nevertheless, Fischer remained steadfast in his convictions and continued to work tirelessly for the cause of justice and equality until his dying day. Fischer's legacy continues to inspire anti-apartheid activists in South Africa and around the world, and he is considered to be one of the greatest heroes of the struggle against apartheid. Today, his name is widely recognized and respected as a symbol of justice and resistance against oppression.</p><p></p><p>

(July 26, 1926		South Africa-July 23, 1994)


was
a South African
politician.


					</p><p>He was the founder and leader of the illegal African nationalist organization, the Ciskei National Independence Party (CNIP) in the apartheid South Africa. At the time of CNIP’s emergence, Sebe was a member of the African National Congress, but later became disillusioned with the organization and founded CNIP in 1961. In 1981, Sebe was appointed President and Chief Minister of the Ciskei, an area in the eastern Cape region that was granted nominal independence by the apartheid government. However, Sebe’s rule was characterized by corruption, nepotism, and human rights violations. His regime was known for its harsh crackdown on political dissent, detention without trial, and the use of torture to extract information from prisoners. Sebe was eventually overthrown in a military coup in 1990 and was arrested and charged with corruption, fraud, and human rights abuses. Sebe died four years later while serving his prison sentence.  Despite his controversial legacy, Sebe had a significant impact on the evolution of South African nationalism and contributed to the struggle against apartheid.</p><p>As a young man, Lennox Sebe studied politics and law, becoming involved in student political activism. He worked as a lawyer before becoming more involved in politics, where he quickly rose in the ranks due to his charisma and leadership skills. Sebe's turn away from the African National Congress towards the Ciskei National Independence Party was influenced in part by his desire for greater autonomy for the Xhosa people, who were a majority in the region. While Sebe advocated for independence for the Ciskei, his rule over the region was marked by authoritarianism and the suppression of political opposition.</p><p>Sebe's government was notorious for its close monitoring of citizens, including phone tapping and mail interception. The regime also heavily censored the press, effectively controlling the spread of information in the region. Sebe maintained power in the face of opposition from within the Ciskei, including a significant challenge from his own brother, George Sebe, who was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Ciskei's notorious Maximum Security prison.</p><p>Despite his undemocratic rule, Sebe did take some steps towards modernizing the Ciskei's infrastructure, introducing a number of development projects during his tenure. He also helped promote Xhosa culture and language throughout the Ciskei, an issue which was especially important to him.</p><p>Sebe's legacy continues to be debated in South Africa to this day, with some seeing him as an important figure in the struggle for black liberation, while others see him as a dictator who was responsible for widespread human rights abuses.</p><p></p><p>
