					</p><p>Bernhard Eunom Philippi was not only a politician, but also a naturalist, zoologist, and botanist. He was born in Charlottenburg, Germany and immigrated to Chile in 1838. After his arrival, he traveled extensively throughout Chile, studying and documenting the country's flora and fauna. Philippi became a professor of natural history at the National Institute in Santiago and published several scientific works on Chilean plant and animal life. </p><p>In addition to his scientific pursuits, Philippi also played an active role in Chilean politics. He served as a deputy in the Chilean Congress and was a vocal opponent of the government's treatment of the indigenous Mapuche people. Philippi believed in the need to protect and preserve their culture and territory.</p><p>Philippi's legacy in Chilean science and politics continues to be recognized and celebrated. Many of his works are still used as reference material in the study of Chilean biodiversity, and a number of species have been named after him, such as the Philippi's tuco-tuco and the Philippi's beaked snake. In 2017, a statue honoring Philippi was unveiled in the city of Punta Arenas, where he spent his final years.</p><p>Throughout his career, Bernhard Eunom Philippi remained dedicated to promoting scientific research and education in Chile. He helped to establish the Chilean National Museum of Natural History in Santiago, which today houses a vast collection of specimens and artifacts, and provides a wealth of resources for researchers and students. Philippi also worked to expand access to education, particularly for women and indigenous people, and he advocated for the establishment of public schools throughout the country.  </p><p>In addition to his scientific and political accomplishments, Philippi was also a devoted family man. He married his wife, Ana Greve, shortly after arriving in Chile, and together they raised ten children. Many of Philippi's descendants, including his great-grandson, the writer Pablo Neruda, have achieved fame and success in various fields of endeavor.  Despite his untimely death at the age of 41, Bernhard Eunom Philippi left a lasting impact on Chilean culture and society, and his contributions continue to be remembered and celebrated to this day.</p><p></p><p>
