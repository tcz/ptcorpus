(November 9, 1918		Towson-September 17, 1996			Berlin)

	
		a.k.a. Vice President Spiro Agnew, Spiro Theodore Agnew or Ted

	
was
an American
lawyer and politician.


					
			
		He had
		four
		children,
		Pamela Lee Agnew, James Rand Agnew, Susan Scott Agnew and Elinor Kimberly Agnew.

						</p><p>Agnew served as the 39th Vice President of the United States from 1969 to 1973, under President Richard Nixon. Prior to his role as Vice President, Agnew served as the Governor of Maryland from 1967 to 1969. During his tenure as Vice President, Agnew was known for his vocal criticisms of the media, Democrats, and anti-Vietnam War protesters. However, he ultimately resigned from his position in 1973 after being charged with accepting bribes and tax evasion. After leaving office, Agnew worked as a business consultant and maintained a low public profile until his death in 1996.</p><p>Agnew was born to Greek immigrant parents and grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Johns Hopkins University, where he earned his Bachelor's degree in Political Science, and later went on to study law at the University of Baltimore School of Law. After his graduation, he practiced law in Baltimore and became involved in local politics.</p><p>His rise in politics began in 1962 when he was elected as the Baltimore County Executive, where he served for five years before being elected as the Governor of Maryland in 1966. During his tenure as Governor, he advocated for educational reform and modernizing the state's transportation system.</p><p>Agnew's time as Vice President was largely defined by his controversial speeches, in which he attacked the media for their coverage of the Nixon administration and criticized anti-war protestors. However, his political career came to an abrupt end when he was investigated for corruption and pleaded no contest to the charges of tax evasion and bribery.</p><p>Despite the scandal, Agnew remained unrepentant in his later years and maintained that he was a victim of a political witch hunt. He also authored several books, including his memoir, "Go Quietly...Or Else," in which he defended his tenure as Vice President and his decision to resign.</p><p>Agnew's legacy remains deeply polarizing, with some viewing him as a victim of political persecution and others condemning him as a corrupt politician. However, his impact on American politics is undeniable, as his aggressive attacks on the media foreshadowed the ongoing debate over the role of the press in the government.</p><p>Additionally, during his time in office, Agnew was known for his conservative views and his support of Richard Nixon's policies, including the Vietnam War and "law and order" initiatives. He was also a strong advocate for states' rights and argued for a more limited federal government. Agnew's resignation marked the first time in United States history that a Vice President resigned due to criminal charges. Following his resignation, Agnew lived a relatively quiet life, staying largely out of the public eye. He died in Berlin, Maryland in 1996 at the age of 77. Despite the controversies that surrounded his political career, Agnew is remembered by many as a skilled public speaker and a forceful debater, as well as for his impact on American politics during a turbulent era in the country's history.</p><p>Agnew was known for his use of colorful language and inflammatory rhetoric, which often resulted in controversy. He famously referred to members of the media as "an effete corps of impudent snobs" and described anti-war protesters as "an irrational fringe." Agnew's critics accused him of using divisive language to distract from the Nixon administration's controversial policies and to appeal to conservative voters.</p><p>Despite the scandal that ended his political career, Agnew remained a popular figure among some segments of the American public. He was seen by many as a champion of conservative values and a defender of traditional American values. In the years following his resignation, he continued to speak out on political issues and remained an influential figure within conservative circles.</p><p>Agnew's legacy remains a subject of debate, with some viewing him as a symbol of corruption and others as a victim of political persecution. However, few doubt the significant impact that he had on American politics during one of the most tumultuous periods in the country's history. His outspoken criticism of the media and his advocacy of conservative causes helped to shape the political landscape of the United States in the latter half of the 20th century.</p><p></p><p>

He passed away in 1991, leaving behind a legacy as one of Hollywood's most beloved leading men.</p><p>Despite his reputation as a clean-cut actor, MacMurray also had a wild side. He was known to be quite the ladies' man and was known to have affairs with many of his co-stars, including Carole Lombard and Marlene Dietrich. He was married twice, first to Lillian Lamont from 1936 to 1956 and then to actress June Haver from 1954 until his death in 1991.MacMurray was also an avid collector of antique cars, owning over 200 at one point. In fact, he was even a member of the Horseless Carriage Club of America! Throughout his life, he remained grounded and humble, despite his fame and fortune.

He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance in "The Caine Mutiny" in 1955.

He played the saxophone, clarinet, and flute, and was known to entertain friends and family with impromptu performances. MacMurray also recorded several albums, including "Music for Twisters" and "Fred MacMurray Plays the Swingin' Young Rebel."</p><p>MacMurray's legacy as an actor and philanthropist continues to be celebrated today. The Fred MacMurray Foundation, established by his family after his death, helps support children in need and promotes the arts. MacMurray's contributions to the entertainment industry and his dedication to his family and community serve as an inspiration to many.</p><p>One interesting fact about Fred MacMurray is that he was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood in the mid-1950s, earning $400,000 per film. Another notable role of his was in the Disney film "The Absent-Minded Professor," in which he played the lead character, a bumbling professor who invents a substance that makes objects fly. The film was a huge success and spawned a sequel called "Son of Flubber." Despite his success as an actor, MacMurray remained down-to-earth and never let his fame go to his head. He was regarded by his peers as a consummate professional and a true gentleman.</p><p></p><p>

In 2006, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement at the British Comedy Awards, and he also received a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2010 for his services to broadcasting. Following his death, many of his peers paid tribute to his groundbreaking work, with former Prime Minister Tony Blair describing him as "a brilliant satirist" who was "never afraid of speaking his mind."</p><p>Despite his passing, John Fortune's legacy continues to inspire comedians and satirists around the world. His unique brand of comedy, which blended sharp wit with social commentary, helped to redefine the genre and influenced generations of future artists.
