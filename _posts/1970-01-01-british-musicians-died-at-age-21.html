					</p><p>Sutcliffe is best known for being an early member of the Beatles. He met John Lennon at the Liverpool College of Art in 1957, where they became friends and formed a band called the Quarrymen. Sutcliffe joined the band on bass guitar in 1960 and played with them in their early gigs in Hamburg, Germany. However, as his interest in art grew, he decided to leave the band in 1961 to pursue a career as a painter.</p><p>Sutcliffe's artistic talent was recognized during his time at college, where he won several awards for his paintings. He continued to paint even after leaving the band, and his works were exhibited in galleries in Liverpool and London. Sutcliffe's art was influenced by the Abstract Expressionist movement, and he often worked with large canvases.</p><p>Sadly, Sutcliffe's life was tragically cut short at the age of 21 due to a brain aneurysm. Despite his short career as a musician, his contribution to the Beatles' early sound was significant and his legacy as an artist continues to be celebrated.</p><p>After Sutcliffe's death, his work as a painter gained renewed interest and acclaim. In 1996, the Tate Liverpool held a retrospective of his artwork, and his paintings continue to be exhibited in galleries around the world. Sutcliffe's life and career have been the subject of several biographies and films, including the 1994 movie "Backbeat," which tells the story of his time with the Beatles in Hamburg. His relationship with photographer Astrid Kirchherr, who he met during the band's time in Hamburg, has also been the subject of much fascination and speculation. Today, Sutcliffe is remembered not just as a footnote in the history of the Beatles, but as a talented artist in his own right.</p><p></p><p>
