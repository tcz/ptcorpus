(March 12, 1685		Kilkenny-January 12, 1753			Oxford)


was
a British
philosopher.


					</p><p>He is best known for his philosophy of idealism, which asserts that reality is nothing but mental perception and that physical objects do not exist independently of the mind that perceives them. Berkeley believed that the only things that truly exist are minds and their ideas, and that the physical world is merely a collection of ideas in the minds of God and humans. He argued that the world is sustained by God's perception of it and that nothing can exist without being perceived. In addition to his philosophical work, Berkeley was also a bishop of the Church of Ireland and a major figure in the Anglican Church. He is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the early modern period and his ideas have had a major impact on subsequent philosophical thought.</p><p>Berkeley was born in Ireland and attended Trinity College Dublin, where he studied Greek and Latin classics. He later became a fellow at the college and was ordained as an Anglican priest. In 1713, he published his first major work, "A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge," which laid out his philosophy of idealism. He went on to publish several other works on the subject, including "Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous."</p><p>Berkeley's philosophy was a response to the prevailing views of the time, particularly the materialism of thinkers like John Locke. He argued that materialism was inconsistent with Christianity and that it led to skepticism about the existence of God. Berkeley's idealism was an attempt to provide a more coherent and consistent worldview based on Christian principles.</p><p>In addition to his work as a philosopher and theologian, Berkeley was also involved in charitable and educational activities. He founded a school in Ireland and advocated for the establishment of a college in Bermuda that would provide education for Native Americans.</p><p>Berkeley's ideas have been influential not only in philosophy but also in other fields, such as psychology and neuroscience. His emphasis on the role of perception in shaping our understanding of the world has been a major theme in modern cognitive science.</p><p>Berkeley was a prolific writer and his ideas were highly influential during his lifetime. He corresponded with many of the leading thinkers of his day, including Samuel Johnson, David Hume, and Voltaire. He was also a frequent visitor to London society and was known for his wit and charm.</p><p>Despite his success as a philosopher and theologian, Berkeley faced criticism from some quarters. Many of his contemporaries saw his idealism as a form of skepticism, and some accused him of denying the reality of the external world. However, he maintained that his philosophy was not meant to deny the existence of the physical world, but rather to explain the relationship between the mind and reality.</p><p>Today, Berkeley's ideas are still widely studied and debated, and his philosophy continues to have a profound impact on contemporary thought. His emphasis on the importance of perception and the role of the mind in shaping our understanding of the world remains a central theme in philosophy, cognitive science, and psychology.</p><p>Berkeley's idealism also had a significant impact on the development of American philosophy. His teachings influenced the works of notable American philosophers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, William James, and Josiah Royce. Additionally, Berkeley's ideas served as a philosophical foundation for the Transcendentalist movement in America, which emphasized the importance of the individual's experience of nature and the spiritual world.</p><p>In his later years, Berkeley continued to write and publish philosophical works while serving as the Bishop of Cloyne. He also devoted himself to charity work, establishing a scheme to provide financial support for the widows of clergy members. Berkeley's contributions to philosophy, religion, and education have earned him a lasting legacy as one of the most important thinkers of the 18th century.</p><p>Berkeley's philosophical ideas have had a profound impact on the modern understanding of language and semantics. He believed that language and meaning were intimately connected to perception and that our understanding of words and concepts was shaped by our sensory experiences. This concept has been particularly influential in the study of linguistics and has led to the development of theories of language based on embodied cognition.</p><p>Berkeley's philosophical ideas also had a significant influence on the Romantic movement in literature and art. Many Romantic writers and artists shared his emphasis on the importance of perception and the subjective experience of the individual. They rejected the Enlightenment idea of objective reality and celebrated the beauty and wonder of the natural world.</p><p>Berkeley's legacy as a philosopher and theologian has had a lasting impact not only on intellectual history but also on wider social and political movements. His ideas about the importance of perception, individual experience, and the relationship between mind and reality have been used to argue for the rights of marginalized groups, including women and people of color. Berkeley's philosophy continues to inspire and challenge contemporary thinkers in a wide range of fields.</p><p></p><p>

Some of his most famous works include "Ophelia," "The Blind Girl," and "The Boyhood of Raleigh." He was also a prolific portrait painter, capturing the likenesses of many notable individuals of his time.</p><p>In addition to his artistic pursuits, Millais was a founding member of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters and a member of the Royal Academy of Arts. He was knighted in 1885, becoming Sir John Everett Millais.</p><p>Millais began his artistic training at the Royal Academy at the young age of 11, where he quickly distinguished himself as a talented artist. He won numerous awards and accolades throughout his career, including a gold medal at the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1855, and was widely regarded as one of the leading artists of his time.</p><p>Despite his success, Millais remained dedicated to his art and continued to experiment with new techniques and styles. In later life, he turned to landscape painting, producing a series of works that celebrated the natural beauty of the English countryside.</p><p>Millais' enduring legacy can be seen in the many museums and galleries around the world that hold his work, including the Tate Britain in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.</p><p>Millais' talent and skill as an artist were evident from a very young age. His prodigious ability allowed him to enter the Royal Academy Schools at the age of 11, where he became the youngest student ever admitted. He quickly rose to prominence as a skilled painter, and at the age of just 17, he exhibited his first work at the Royal Academy.</p><p>Although Millais is primarily known for his association with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and their distinctive style, he also worked in a variety of other genres throughout his career. He was a successful genre painter, producing scenes of everyday life that were often infused with social commentary. He also painted historical and biblical subjects, as well as landscapes and portraits.</p><p>Throughout his life, Millais maintained a deep commitment to artistic innovation and experimentation. He went on to develop a looser, more impressionistic style in his later years, which was heavily influenced by the French art he encountered during his travels.</p><p>Despite his exceptional talent and success, Millais remained a deeply humble and dedicated artist throughout his life.

His legacy as a skilled artist, talented innovator, and social advocate remains an enduring one.</p><p>Millais was married twice during his lifetime, first to Euphemia Chalmers Gray and then to Effie Gray. His marriage to Effie was particularly notable, as she had previously been married to the art critic John Ruskin. Their marriage famously annulled due to Ruskin's alleged impotence, which Effie claimed prevented their marriage from being consummated. Millais and Effie went on to marry each other, and they had eight children together.Millais was a close friend of Charles Dickens, and the two collaborated on a number of projects together. Millais provided illustrations for several of Dickens' novels, including "The Pickwick Papers" and "Oliver Twist." He was also one of the pallbearers at Dickens' funeral in 1870.Millais' work is renowned for its exceptional detail and realism. He was known for the meticulous attention he paid to his subject matter and for his ability to capture the essence of a scene or character.
