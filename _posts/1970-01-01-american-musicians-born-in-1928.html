His contributions to music, both as a member of the Platters and as a solo artist, have made him a legend in the industry and his voice continues to be celebrated today.</p><p>In addition to being known for his music, Tony Williams was also a charismatic performer known for his flashy stage presence and style. He was often seen wearing sequined suits and performing energetic dance moves while singing. Williams was also known for his collaborations with other artists. He worked with musicians such as Sammy Davis Jr. and Ella Fitzgerald, and he recorded an album with jazz pianist Herbie Hancock in 1964.
