(August 1, 1489		Correggio-March 5, 1534			Correggio)

	
		a.k.a. Correggio or Antonio Allegri

	
was
an Italian
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He was a prominent figure of the Renaissance period and is well-known for his use of light and shadow in his works. Correggio's art was heavily influenced by the works of Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael, and his style was characterized by bold, colorful figures and a dynamic sense of movement.</p><p>Correggio's most famous works include "The Assumption of the Virgin" and "Jupiter and Io," which can now be seen in the Cathedral of Parma and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, respectively.</p><p>He was also commissioned by various patrons to paint frescoes and murals in churches and public buildings throughout Italy, solidifying his reputation as one of the greatest artists of his time.</p><p>Unfortunately, Correggio's life was cut short when he died at the age of 44 due to fever. Nevertheless, his legacy continues to inspire artists and art enthusiasts to this day.</p><p>Correggio was born in Correggio, a small town in northern Italy, and began his artistic training under his father. He later moved to Mantua and then to Parma, where he was exposed to the works of other prominent artists such as Andrea Mantegna and Parmigianino. It was in Parma where Correggio painted one of his most celebrated works, "The Assumption of the Virgin," for the dome of the city's cathedral.</p><p>Throughout his career, Correggio received numerous commissions from wealthy patrons, including Isabella d'Este, the Marchioness of Mantua, and Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. Correggio's versatility as an artist allowed him to excel in various mediums, including fresco, oil painting, and engraving.</p><p>Despite his success, Correggio's personal life was marked by tragedy. He lost his wife and several children to the plague, and his own health was frequently in decline. Correggio's death at a relatively young age was a significant loss to the art world, but his contributions continue to be admired and studied for their technical mastery and innovative style.</p><p>In addition to his artistic career, Correggio was also known for his humble and generous personality. He was described as a warm and kind-hearted person who showed compassion towards the less fortunate. Correggio was also known to have a good sense of humor and often incorporated playful elements into his artwork.</p><p>Correggio's influence can be seen in the works of later artists, such as Peter Paul Rubens and Rembrandt, who were inspired by his use of light and shadow. He is also considered to be a pioneer for his use of foreshortening, which allowed for a more dynamic and naturalistic depiction of the human form.</p><p>Today, Correggio's works can be found in museums and galleries around the world, including the Louvre in Paris, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Despite his short life, Correggio is remembered as one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance era and a master of light and perspective.</p><p></p><p>

(June 16, 1947		McLean-August 10, 1991			Martinsburg)


was
an Italian
journalist.


					</p><p>Casolaro was known for his investigation into what he called "The Octopus", a supposed conspiracy involving government officials, organized crime figures, and intelligence operatives. He was working on a book about this when he died. His death was controversial and some have speculated that it may have been a murder meant to silence him.</p><p>Casolaro was born and raised in McLean, Virginia. He attended West Virginia University and George Washington University, but dropped out of both without earning a degree. In the 1970s and 1980s, he worked as a freelance writer and investigative journalist, covering a range of topics including political corruption, organized crime, and technology.</p><p>Casolaro became interested in the "The Octopus" conspiracy theory in the late 1980s. He believed that a network of powerful individuals and entities, spanning across the government, the military, the intelligence community, and the world of organized crime, were secretly working together for their own benefit. He referred to this network as "The Octopus", and claimed that its tentacles reached every corner of American society.</p><p>Casolaro traveled extensively and conducted dozens of interviews in pursuit of his investigation into "The Octopus". He also wrote letters to government officials, requesting information and documentation related to his research. However, his efforts did not yield any definitive proof of the existence of the conspiracy.</p><p>On August 10, 1991, Casolaro was found dead in a hotel room in Martinsburg, West Virginia, with his wrists slashed multiple times in an apparent suicide. The circumstances of his death were controversial, and several of his friends and colleagues expressed doubts that he had taken his own life. Some suspected that he had been murdered in order to prevent him from publishing his findings about "The Octopus". To this day, the cause and circumstances of his death remain a subject of speculation and debate.</p><p>Despite the lack of conclusive evidence regarding his theories, Danny Casolaro's legacy and investigative work inspired other journalists and conspiracy theorists to continue pursuing the concept of "The Octopus". His investigation into potential government corruption and secret alliances with organized crime figures remains a topic of interest and intrigue for many. Casolaro's death also sparked controversy and raised questions about the ethics of investigative journalism, the limits of free speech, and the extent to which powerful institutions can control information and narratives. His life and work were the subject of a book titled "The Octopus: Secret Government and the Death of Danny Casolaro" by Kenn Thomas and Jim Keith.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by suicide.
