(May 15, 1862		Leopoldstadt-October 21, 1931			Vienna)

	
		also known as Dr. Arthur Schnitzler

	
was
an Austrian
playwright, writer and novelist.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Lili Schnitzler and Heinrich Schnitzler.

						</p><p>Schnitzler was born in Vienna, Austria and studied medicine at the University of Vienna, where he received his doctorate in 1885. After receiving his degree, he practiced medicine briefly before turning to writing full-time. He wrote plays, novels, and short stories, often exploring themes of sexuality, death, and the human psyche. Schnitzler's most famous work, "Traumnovelle" (Dream Story), was later adapted into the screenplay for the film "Eyes Wide Shut" directed by Stanley Kubrick. However, many of his works were initially considered controversial and were often censored due to their explicit content. Despite this, he became an influential figure in the Viennese literary scene and was a member of the prestigious "Vienna Circle". Schnitzler is remembered for his contribution to the development of modernist literature and psychology, and his work continues to be studied and performed around the world.</p><p>Schnitzler was known to be a critic of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and was a supporter of the idea of greater autonomy for the various ethnic groups within the Empire. He was also a pacifist and believed in the importance of international cooperation and understanding. However, his views were not without controversy, and he often came under fire by both conservative and progressive factions of society. In addition to his literary works, he also kept extensive diaries which contained insights into his personal life and reflections on the society in which he lived. Schnitzler's writing was highly influential on the development of the modernist movement in literature and was an important precursor to later writers such as Franz Kafka and Robert Musil. Today, he is recognized as one of the most important writers of the early 20th century and his works continue to resonate with readers and audiences alike.</p><p>Schnitzler's interest in psychology is reflected in many of his works, where he delves deep into the inner workings of his characters' minds. He often used the stream-of-consciousness technique, which was a relatively new approach to writing at the time, and this helped to establish him as one of the foremost modernist writers of his era. In addition to his own writing, Schnitzler was a mentor to several other writers and helped to shape the literary landscape of Vienna in the early 20th century. Despite facing censorship and criticism throughout his career, he remained committed to his writing and continued to produce works that challenged societal norms and pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable at the time. Today, his legacy lives on in the many adaptations of his works for stage and screen, as well as in the ongoing discussions surrounding his contributions to the literary and cultural movements of his time.</p><p>Schnitzler was also known for his active social and political life. He was a member of several political and cultural organizations, including the Austrian PEN Club and the Austrian Society for Literature. He was also a fervent advocate for artistic freedom and was known to defend artists whose works were under attack by censorship or repression. In the final years of his life, he continued to write prolifically, but his work became progressively darker and reflected his concern with mortality and the human condition. Despite his critical acclaim and influence, he was often overshadowed by more flamboyant contemporaries such as Sigmund Freud and Gustav Mahler. However, his work has endured and continues to inspire both literary and social movements. Today, he is recognized as one of the most important literary figures of early 20th century Vienna and a pioneer of modernist literature.</p><p></p><p>

(July 23, 1883		Vienna-February 12, 1953			Veitshöchheim)


was
an Austrian
psychologist and philosopher.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work in the field of phenomenology, focusing on the study of perception and consciousness. Kafka was heavily influenced by the philosophy of Edmund Husserl and was an advocate of the "phenomenological reduction," a method of analyzing and describing experiences as they are perceived first-hand.</p><p>In addition to his academic work, Kafka was also actively involved in politics and social activism. He was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria and served on Vienna's city council from 1919 to 1934.</p><p>During World War II, Kafka was forced to flee Austria due to his Jewish heritage. He eventually settled in the town of Veitshöchheim in Bavaria, Germany, where he continued his work as a psychologist and philosopher until his death in 1953.</p><p>Kafka's contributions to phenomenology are still studied today and his ideas have influenced many fields beyond psychology, including art, literature, and neuroscience. One of his notable works is the essay "On the Problem of Empathy," which explores the role of empathy in human relationships and communication. Kafka's activism and political involvement were integral to his worldview, and he saw his work in philosophy and psychology as a way to better understand and address social issues. Despite facing discrimination and persecution due to his Jewish identity, Kafka remained dedicated to his work and continued to publish and teach throughout his life.</p><p>Kafka received his PhD in psychology from the University of Vienna in 1909 and later went on to become a professor there. He also taught at the New School for Social Research in New York City for a brief period in 1934.After the war, Kafka's legacy was recognized with the posthumous publication of his works by his students and colleagues. His ideas were influential in the development of existential psychology and played a key role in shaping the field of cognitive psychology in the 20th century. He is often cited as a key figure in the development of the humanistic psychology movement, which focuses on individual agency and experience. Kafka's work continues to be studied and his ideas remain relevant to contemporary debates in psychology and philosophy.</p><p>Throughout his career, Gustav Kafka published numerous articles and books on his philosophical and psychological theories. One of his most significant works, "The Principle of Phenomenology," was published in 1932 and is still considered a seminal text in the field. In the book, Kafka outlines his methodology of studying individual experiences and consciousness as they are, without judgement or presuppositions. He also explores the relationship between the subjective experience of consciousness and objectivity, arguing that the two are intimately connected.</p><p>In addition to his academic contributions, Kafka was also involved in establishing mental health clinics and programs in Austria. He believed that mental health care should be accessible to all, regardless of socioeconomic status. Kafka's dedication to social justice and his work with marginalized communities was a reflection of his deeply held belief in the power of empathy and compassion.</p><p>Today, Gustav Kafka is remembered as one of the most significant figures in the development of phenomenology and humanistic psychology. His contributions to the field have had a lasting impact on our understanding of perception, consciousness, and the human experience. Despite the challenges he faced as a result of his Jewish heritage and political views, Kafka remained committed to his principles and continued to work towards a more just and compassionate world.</p><p></p><p>

(January 18, 1873		Vienna-December 27, 1942			Los Angeles)


was
an Austrian
philosopher.


					</p><p>He was the younger brother of the classical scholar Theodor Gomperz. Heinrich Gomperz studied philosophy and classical philology at the University of Vienna, where he completed his doctorate in 1895. He held various academic positions in Austria and Germany before emigrating to the United States in 1939. Gomperz's major works include "Greek Thinkers: A History of Ancient Philosophy," "Introduction to Greek Philosophy," and "Plato's Political Philosophy." In addition to his philosophical pursuits, he was also an accomplished pianist and served as a music critic for several publications. Despite being Jewish, Gomperz converted to Catholicism in the 1920s. He died in Los Angeles while in exile during World War II.</p><p>During his career, Heinrich Gomperz made significant contributions to the study of ancient Greek philosophy. He was known for his expertise in the areas of Plato's political thought and Aristotle's theory of knowledge. Gomperz was also a devoted teacher and mentor, and his students included several notable philosophers and scholars. He was a strong advocate for academic freedom and was outspoken about the dangers of totalitarianism, which led to his decision to leave Austria when the Nazis came to power. In the United States, he continued to work on his philosophical writings and remained active in academic circles until his death. In addition to his musical pursuits and philosophical work, Gomperz was also a lover of nature and spent much of his free time hiking and exploring the outdoors. He is remembered today as a brilliant thinker and a dedicated scholar who made significant contributions to the field of philosophy.</p><p>Gomperz's works on ancient Greek philosophy were highly regarded not just for their scholarly rigor, but also for their accessibility to a wider audience. His "Introduction to Greek Philosophy," in particular, was aimed at students and general readers who may not have had a background in classical studies. Gomperz's approach emphasized the continuity of philosophical inquiry throughout different eras and schools of thought, rather than focusing on isolated individual thinkers.</p><p>In addition to his writings on philosophy, Gomperz was an avid traveler and spent significant time in Italy, Greece, and other parts of the Mediterranean. His experiences abroad influenced his views on art and culture, which he discussed in his essays and reviews on music and theater. Gomperz was also known for his wit and humor, which made him a popular figure in social circles.</p><p>Despite his conversion to Catholicism, Gomperz remained proud of his Jewish heritage and was active in Jewish cultural organizations. His writings on Jewish philosophy and theology reflected his deep interest in the subject. However, his decision to convert also caused controversy, and some of his colleagues accused him of opportunism.</p><p>In the United States, Gomperz initially struggled to find a permanent academic position due to his age and unfamiliarity with the American academic system. However, he continued to write and lecture, and his reputation as a scholar helped him secure visiting appointments at several universities. He also formed friendships with prominent intellectuals, including the philosopher Martin Heidegger, with whom he corresponded for many years.</p><p>Gomperz's legacy as a scholar of ancient Greek philosophy continued to influence generations of philosophers long after his death. His ideas on the importance of political philosophy and its connection to morality and ethics have made him an important figure in the debate over the role of philosophy in public life. Gomperz was also an inspiration to many of his students, who went on to become influential philosophers and scholars in their own right.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced during his life, including persecution as a Jew and exile during World War II, Gomperz remained committed to the pursuit of knowledge and the values of intellectual inquiry. His writings are a testament to his broad interests in philosophy, music, and culture, as well as his dedication to promoting critical thinking and academic freedom. Today, he is remembered as a brilliant thinker and an important contributor to the history of philosophy.</p><p></p><p>

(June 12, 1899		Zolochiv-December 26, 1968			New York City)

	
		otherwise known as Arthur Fellig, Arthur H. Fellig or Arthur &#039;Weegee&#039; Fellig

	
was
an Austrian
photographer and journalist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work as a press photographer in New York City during the 1930s and 1940s, capturing the gritty and sometimes gruesome side of life in the city. Weegee was a self-taught photographer who often worked at night, using a large format camera and flash to capture his images. He gained prominence for his coverage of crime scenes and accidents, earning him the nickname "Weegee" (from the Ouija board, because he seemed to arrive at crime scenes before the police). He also photographed celebrities and everyday people, and published several books of his work during his lifetime. In addition to his photography, Weegee was also known for his outgoing and often eccentric personality, which helped him gain access and insider knowledge in his work.</p><p>Weegee's photographs have become emblematic of the "film noir" visual style, and his images have been celebrated for their starkness, raw emotion, and dark humor. In addition to crime scenes and accidents, Weegee photographed the city's nightlife, capturing the essence of the city's burlesque shows, nightclubs, and street life. He also documented the social, political, and economic landscape of the city during the Depression and World War II. Weegee's work has been exhibited at major institutions worldwide, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. He continues to be an influential figure in street photography and photojournalism.</p><p>Weegee's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. He immigrated to the United States with his family when he was a child, settling in New York City's Lower East Side. As a teenager, he worked in a variety of odd jobs to support himself and his family, including as a pushcart vendor and a street photographer. He purchased his first camera in the mid-1920s and began taking photos for a photography supply company.</p><p>Weegee's career took off in the 1930s, as he began to earn a reputation as a freelance press photographer. He worked primarily for the daily tabloids, such as the Daily News and the New York Post, which were known for sensationalistic coverage of crime and human interest stories. He developed a distinctive style, using a large-format camera and a powerful strobe flash to capture his images. He often arrived on the scene of a crime or accident before the police, using the police radio to track the location of incidents.</p><p>In addition to his work as a press photographer, Weegee also took portraits of celebrities and ordinary people, using his unique style to capture their personalities and quirks. He was a regular at nightclubs and other hot spots, using his outgoing personality and gift for gab to gain access to exclusive events and to get people to pose for his camera.</p><p>Weegee's photographs were often shocking and graphic, showing the underbelly of New York City life in a way that had never been seen before. Despite this, he maintained a sense of humor and irony in his work, capturing both the tragedy and the absurdity of life in the city. His images have played a significant role in shaping our collective image of New York City during the 1930s and 1940s, and his legacy lives on today in the work of many contemporary street photographers.</p><p>Weegee's most well-known body of work was a book of his photographs entitled "Naked City", published in 1945. The book showcased some of his best photographs of New York City's diverse and often overlooked neighborhoods, as well as some of the city's most shocking crimes and accidents. "Naked City" went on to inspire a Hollywood film by the same name in 1948, which further cemented Weegee's reputation as one of the most significant photographers of his time.</p><p>Later in life, Weegee's career began to decline as he struggled with alcoholism and other personal issues. He continued to take photographs and work as a freelancer, but he never achieved the same level of success as he did in his earlier years. Weegee died in 1968 at the age of 69, but his legacy as an important figure in street photography and photojournalism lives on to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(January 18, 1851		Roštín-July 14, 1920			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>He is best known for his works as a historian, political activist, and journalist. Friedjung was highly interested in the history of Austria and the Habsburg Empire, and he spent much of his life writing about these topics. One of his most significant works, "The Struggle for Supremacy in Germany," explored the struggles between Austria and Prussia in the 19th century. </p><p>Friedjung was also an important figure in Austrian politics, and he played a key role in the pan-German movement, which sought to unite all German-speaking people under one government. His political views often attracted controversy, and he was involved in several high-profile scandals during his lifetime. </p><p>In addition to his scholarly and political work, Friedjung was an accomplished journalist. He worked for several newspapers, including Die Presse and Die Neue Freie Presse, and he was known for his insightful commentary on current events. Despite his sometimes controversial views, Friedjung remained a respected figure in Austrian intellectual circles until his death in 1920.</p><p>Heinrich Friedjung was born in Moravia, in the Czech Republic, which was then a part of the Austrian Empire. He was educated at universities in Vienna, Graz, and Leipzig. In 1873, Friedjung received his doctorate in history from the University of Vienna. After completing his studies, he worked as a teacher and lecturer before turning to journalism and writing.</p><p>In addition to his work on the history of Austria and the Habsburg Empire, Friedjung was also interested in the history of the Balkans. He wrote several books on the subject, including "The Struggle for a National State in Serbia" and "Serbia and the Serbian Revolution." His research on the Balkans was considered groundbreaking at the time and helped to shape the field of Balkan studies.</p><p>Friedjung's involvement in politics often led to controversy. He was a proponent of the pan-German movement, which sought to unite all German-speaking people under one government. This view put him at odds with many non-German speakers in Austria, including Czechs and Slovaks. Friedjung also supported the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary in 1908, which was a controversial move that contributed to the tensions leading up to World War I.</p><p>Despite his political views, Friedjung remained a respected figure in intellectual circles.

In 1904, he published a series of articles claiming that Serbia was plotting to undermine and overthrow the Austro-Hungarian Empire. These articles were later found to be false, and Friedjung was accused of fabricating evidence to support his claims. He was tried for perjury, and the trial became a major spectacle in Austria-Hungary, with public protests and press coverage. Although he was eventually acquitted, the scandal damaged his reputation and raised questions about the reliability of his historical research. Despite this setback, Friedjung continued to write and remained active in political and intellectual circles until his death in 1920.</p><p>Friedjung was also an active participant in the cultural life of Vienna. He was involved in several literary and cultural societies, including the Association of Austrian Authors and the Society of German Authors. He was also a friend and correspondent of many prominent literary figures of his time, including Stefan Zweig and Karl Kraus. Friedjung's own literary output encompassed a wide range of genres, including essays, historical works, and travel writing. One of his most famous books, "Aus Österreichs Leidenszeit," was a collection of essays about the wartime experiences of ordinary Austrians. The book was widely read and became a best-seller in Austria. Friedjung's contributions to Austrian cultural life were recognized during his lifetime, and he was awarded several prizes and honors for his work. Today, he is remembered as an influential historian, political thinker, and journalist who made significant contributions to Austrian intellectual and cultural life.</p><p></p><p>

(November 15, 1876		Graz-January 28, 1946			Graz)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a politician, writer, and diplomat who played a key role in the history of Austria and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He started his career as a journalist before becoming involved in politics. Rintelen was elected to the Austrian parliament and served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1918-1919.</p><p>During World War I, Rintelen was a key player in the efforts to create an independent, pan-German state in Central Europe. He was also a strong advocate for Austrian unity, and he played a leading role in the negotiations that led to the unification of Austria and Germany in 1938.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Rintelen was a prolific writer, publishing numerous books and articles on political and historical topics. He was also a skilled diplomat, serving as Austria's ambassador to Germany from 1938 until the end of World War II.</p><p>Despite his achievements, Rintelen's legacy is somewhat controversial. Some see him as a visionary statesman who played a decisive role in shaping the history of Central Europe. Others view him as a dangerous extremist who was overly influenced by Nazi ideology. Regardless of one's perspective, there is no denying that Anton Rintelen was a major figure in the political and diplomatic history of Austria and the wider region.</p><p>During his time as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Rintelen was instrumental in negotiating the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which officially ended Austria's involvement in World War I. However, he was also a controversial figure and faced criticism for his perceived sympathies with the Nazi regime. In fact, Rintelen was briefly arrested by the Allied forces following the war, but was released due to lack of evidence. </p><p>Rintelen lived out the rest of his life in Graz, where he continued to write and publish books until his death in 1946. Today, his political career remains a subject of debate and scholarly study, with some viewing him as a tragic figure who was ultimately undone by his own extremist beliefs, while others see him as a key player in the complex political landscape of Central Europe during the first half of the twentieth century.</p><p>After the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, Rintelen served as Austria's ambassador to Germany until the end of World War II. He was reportedly aware of the extermination of Jews and other groups by the Nazi regime, but did not openly oppose it. After the war, Rintelen was arrested and imprisoned by the Allied forces, but was again released due to lack of evidence. </p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Rintelen's writings and speeches continue to be studied by historians and political scientists interested in the events leading up to the two World Wars, as well as the complex relationships between Austria, Germany, and other states in Central Europe during the early 20th century.</p><p>Rintelen's interest in politics and diplomacy was sparked early in life. He studied law at the University of Graz, where he also became involved in political activism. After graduation, he worked as a journalist for several years, writing for various newspapers and publications on topics related to politics and foreign affairs. He also travelled extensively throughout Europe, meeting with politicians and intellectuals and developing a broad network of contacts.Rintelen's start in politics came in 1905, when he was elected to the Styrian Landtag, the regional parliament of his home province. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a leader of the right-wing Christian Social Party and eventually serving as Minister of Justice in the Austrian cabinet.In 1914, Rintelen's career took a new turn when he was sent to the United States by the Austro-Hungarian government. His mission was to use his skills as a journalist and diplomat to lobby the American government and public opinion in support of the Central Powers in World War I. Rintelen's time in America was marked by controversy, as he became embroiled in a scandal involving espionage and sabotage.In the years following the war, Rintelen remained active in Austrian politics, advocating for the unification of Austria and Germany and promoting pan-Germanic nationalism. His views became increasingly radicalized, and he began to attract the attention of the Nazi regime in Germany. Despite this, Rintelen continued to serve as a diplomat for Austria, even after the country was annexed by Germany in 1938.Rintelen's later years were marked by illness and isolation. He retreated from public life and spent much of his time writing and studying. He died in 1946, largely forgotten by the world he had so passionately worked to shape.</p><p></p><p>
