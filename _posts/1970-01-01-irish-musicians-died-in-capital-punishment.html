(April 24, 1906		Brooklyn-January 3, 1946			HM Prison Wandsworth)

	
		a.k.a. Lord Haw Haw or Joyce, William

	
was
an Irish
politician.


					</p><p>William Joyce was actually an American-born British fascist politician and Nazi propaganda broadcaster during World War II. Although he was born in Brooklyn, New York, to an Irish Catholic family, Joyce was raised in Ireland and became a naturalized British subject in 1939. He was the leader of the British Union of Fascists until it was disbanded in 1940, and later became a propaganda broadcaster on behalf of Nazi Germany.</p><p>Joyce gained infamy for his broadcasts, which targeted British troops and civilians and aimed to demoralize the British public. He was captured by British authorities in May 1945 and later stood trial for treason. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. Joyce was hanged in 1946 at HM Prison Wandsworth, becoming the last person to be executed for treason in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Joyce was known for his distinctive voice and eloquence, which made him a popular radio personality in Nazi Germany. He was also a fervent anti-Semite and praised the policies of Hitler's regime. Joyce's broadcasts were closely monitored by British intelligence, who referred to him by the nickname "Lord Haw Haw." Despite his efforts to evade capture, he was eventually caught by British forces in Flensburg, Germany, just days after the end of World War II in Europe. </p><p>Joyce's trial for treason was controversial, with some arguing that he was a British citizen and therefore not subject to prosecution for broadcasting on behalf of a foreign power. However, he was ultimately found guilty and sentenced to death. Joyce's execution was met with both satisfaction and outrage, with some calling it an act of justice and others arguing that it was a violation of free speech. Nonetheless, his legacy as a traitor and Nazi collaborator remains a source of controversy and curiosity to this day.</p><p>Joyce was married to Margaret White, an Englishwoman, and the couple had two daughters. After his capture, Margaret fled to Denmark and later Germany, where she gave birth to their third child. Margaret, along with their children, was eventually captured by British authorities and also faced trial for treason, though she was acquitted. Joyce's body was buried in an unmarked grave within the confines of the prison, and his family was not given permission to retrieve his remains until 1976. His remains were then cremated and scattered in the English Channel, as per his request. Joyce's life and legacy have been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries. Despite his controversial and divisive role in history, his impact on British propaganda and the nature of war-time broadcasting remains a topic of interest and debate.</p><p></p><p>
