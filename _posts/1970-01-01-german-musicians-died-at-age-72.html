(June 8, 1909		Frankfurt-February 4, 1982)

	
		also known as Judge Georg Konrad Morgen or Konrad Morgen

	
was
a German
judge.


					</p><p>During World War II, Morgen played a significant role in investigating and prosecuting crimes committed by SS officers, particularly those in concentration and extermination camps.</p><p>Morgen began his career as a lawyer before joining the Nazi Party in 1933. In 1943, he was appointed as a judge in the SS judiciary and tasked with investigating corruption within the concentration camp system. Morgen discovered numerous instances of embezzlement and theft by high-ranking SS officers, particularly in the Auschwitz and Buchenwald camps.</p><p>Despite facing opposition and threats from within the SS, Morgen persevered in his investigations and successfully prosecuted several high-ranking officers. His efforts led to a significant decrease in corruption within the camps and helped save the lives of thousands of prisoners.</p><p>After the war, Morgen was arrested by the Allies and spent several years in prison. However, he was ultimately acquitted of war crimes due to his efforts in prosecuting corrupt SS officers. Morgen went on to live a quiet life as a farmer until his death in 1982.</p><p>In addition to investigating and prosecuting SS officers, Morgen also played a key role in exposing and bringing to justice those responsible for the mass murder of Jews, Slavs, and others in the concentration and extermination camps. He was instrumental in the conviction of Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz, and Eduard Wirths, the chief medical officer of the camp. 
Morgen's dedication to justice and his unwavering pursuit of the truth earned him respect and admiration from survivors of the Nazi regime and those who worked to bring war criminals to justice. 
After his release from prison, Morgen returned to his hometown of Frankfurt where he lived a quiet life, seldom speaking about his experiences during the war. However, he did give occasional interviews and wrote about his time as a judge in the SS judiciary. Today, Morgen is remembered as an unlikely hero who risked his own life to expose and prosecute the crimes committed by the Nazi regime.</p><p>Despite his involvement with the Nazi Party, Morgen often expressed regret for his involvement and believed that he had a duty to rectify the injustices committed by the regime. He was known for his impartiality and commitment to justice, even in the face of intense opposition from his superiors in the SS.In his later years, Morgen became a vocal advocate for peace and reconciliation between Germany and its former enemies. He believed that it was essential to remember the atrocities committed during the war in order to prevent such horrors from happening again.As a lasting legacy, Morgen's work in exposing corruption and prosecuting war criminals has had a profound impact on the development of international law and the pursuit of justice in the aftermath of war. His uncompromising dedication to truth and justice has served as an inspiration to generations of legal professionals and advocates for human rights around the world. Despite the controversy surrounding his involvement with the Nazi Party, Morgen's legacy as a champion of justice and human rights continues to be celebrated by many today.</p><p></p><p>

(February 21, 1880		Ahrensburg-July 31, 1952)


was
a German
novelist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his famous novel "The Adventures of Maya the Bee", which tells the story of a young bee named Maya and her adventures as she explores the world around her. The book became an instant success, and has been translated into many languages. In addition to "The Adventures of Maya the Bee", Bonsels wrote numerous other works, including novels, essays, and travelogues. He was also an accomplished translator, and translated many works from Sanskrit into German. Despite his success, Bonsels' legacy has been somewhat tarnished by his support of the Nazi party during World War II.</p><p>He openly expressed his admiration for Adolf Hitler and his agenda, and even wrote a book about his travels in Nazi Germany. After the war, Bonsels was investigated for his Nazi sympathies, but he was never convicted of any crimes. However, his association with the Nazi party has made it difficult for some readers to fully appreciate his work. Nevertheless, "The Adventures of Maya the Bee" remains a beloved classic of children's literature, and continues to inspire young readers around the world.</p><p>Bonsels was born in Ahrensburg, Germany, and spent much of his childhood exploring the forests and countryside near his home. He showed an early talent for writing and after completing his studies, he moved to Munich, where he began working as a freelance writer. His early works were mainly essays and travelogues, which were published in various magazines and newspapers.</p><p>In 1912, Bonsels published "The Adventures of Maya the Bee", which was an immediate success. The book was a departure from his earlier works, which were primarily aimed at adults, and it became his most famous work. Maya the Bee was also adapted into an animated television series in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p><p>Bonsels continued to write throughout his life, and his later works reflect his interest in Eastern philosophy and spirituality. He was particularly drawn to the teachings of Hinduism and Buddhism, and he spent several years traveling in India in the 1920s and 30s. He wrote several books inspired by his experiences in India, including "The Holy Mountain" and "The Indian Book of Love".</p><p>Despite his controversial views and associations, Bonsels remains an important figure in German literature, and his work continues to be read and enjoyed around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(July 6, 1819		Berlin-January 7, 1892			Vienna)

	
		otherwise known as Ernst Wilhelm von Brucke or Dr. Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke

	
was
a German
physician and scientist.


					</p><p>He is considered a pioneer in the field of physiology and was instrumental in establishing it as a standalone academic discipline. In addition to his research on the functioning of the human body, he also made significant contributions to the study of microbiology and developmental biology. </p><p>In his early career, von Brücke studied medicine in Berlin, where he was deeply influenced by the work of physiologist and anatomist Johannes Müller. He then went on to complete his doctorate in Vienna and eventually became a professor of physiology at the University of Vienna, where he remained for the rest of his career. </p><p>His numerous publications include groundbreaking research on muscle metabolism and the role of nerve cells in transmitting signals in the body. He also conducted experiments on blood circulation and digestion, using innovative techniques such as the first gastroscopy. </p><p>Beyond his contributions to the scientific community, von Brücke was known for his dedication to teaching and mentorship. Many of his students went on to become influential scientists in their own right. His legacy lives on today in the countless medical professionals and researchers who continue to build on the foundation he helped establish.</p><p>Von Brücke was a highly respected and influential figure in the scientific community of his time. He was one of the founding members of the Vienna Medical School, which was a group of physicians and scientists who sought to promote the use of empirical methods in the study and practice of medicine. This approach was based on the idea that medical knowledge should be gained through observation, experimentation, and analysis rather than relying solely on tradition or authority.</p><p>Von Brücke's contributions to the study of physiology were significant and varied. He developed new techniques for studying the nervous system, including the use of microscopy to view neural tissue, and he was one of the first to describe the phenomenon of nerve conduction. His work on the metabolism of muscle tissue laid the groundwork for understanding studies of muscle diseases and the role of the muscle in overall health. His studies on digestion and blood circulation, meanwhile, have been instrumental in understanding the human body's intricacies.</p><p>In addition to his scientific contributions, von Brücke was also known for his advocacy for public health and social reform. He was an ardent supporter of public health initiatives such as sanitation and vaccination, and he believed that science should be used to advance the welfare of society as a whole. His belief in this idea was reflected in his extensive work as a teacher and mentor, and through the many students he trained who went on to achieve great things in the field.</p><p>Overall, von Brücke's life and legacy represent a deep commitment to the scientific method, rigorous research, and interdisciplinary thinking. His pioneering work has had a lasting impact on the field of physiology and on the wider medical community, and he remains a revered figure in the history of science.</p><p>Von Brücke's impact extended beyond the scientific community, as he was also involved in the Vienna public education system, advocating for the use of scientific methods and equipment in teaching. He believed that education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status or background. Additionally, his belief in the importance of advancing the welfare of society led him to be actively involved in social and political reforms, including advocating for workers' rights, better working conditions, and improved access to healthcare for the less fortunate.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, von Brücke faced criticism and opposition from some of his peers who were resistant to his empirical approach to medicine and physiology. However, his convictions in the power of scientific research and experimentation never wavered, and he persevered in his efforts to promote these methods throughout his career.</p><p>Today, von Brücke's contributions to the fields of physiology, microbiology, and developmental biology continue to be recognized and celebrated. The Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke Prize, named in his honor, is awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to these fields. His legacy serves as a testament to the power of scientific inquiry and the importance of using knowledge to better society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>

botanist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work as a plant taxonomist, and his contributions to the classification of flowering plants. Sprengel was also interested in meteorology and wrote several books on the subject. He was born in Boldekow, Pomerania (now Poland) and attended the University of Greifswald where he studied under Johann Heinrich Voigt. Later on, he became the director of the botanical garden at the University of Halle, where he spent most of his career. In 1827, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Sprengel's most significant scientific contribution was his theory of the role of insects in the pollination of flowers, which he first proposed in 1793 at the age of six. His ideas were initially met with skepticism but were eventually proved correct, and his work helped to revolutionize the study of plant reproduction.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to botany and meteorology, Carl Sprengel was also a prolific writer. He published several books on plant taxonomy, including "Flora Halensis" and "Systema Vegetabilium." He also wrote about meteorology, including his book "Theorie des Erdmagnetismus" which laid out his ideas on the magnetic properties of the earth. Sprengel was awarded the Linnean Medal in 1852 for his contributions to botany. He died in Halle, Germany, in 1859 at the age of 72. Today, he is remembered as one of the leading botanists of his time, and his work on plant pollination has had a lasting impact on the field of botany.</p><p>One of Sprengel's major works, "Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen" (The Secret of Nature Discovered in the Structure and Fertilization of Flowers), was published in 1793 when he was just six years old. In this work, Sprengel proposed his theory of the role of insects in pollination, which was initially met with skepticism and criticism from prominent botanists of the time. However, his ideas were later proven correct and became widely accepted by the scientific community.</p><p>Sprengel's contributions to the field of botany were recognized during his lifetime. In addition to being elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, he was also a member of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala and the Leopoldina Academy in Halle. In 1852, the Linnean Society of London awarded him the prestigious Linnean Medal in recognition of his work on plant taxonomy and pollination.</p><p>Today, Sprengel's pioneering work on plant pollination continues to inspire and inform research in the field of botany. Plant biologists continue to study the intricate relationships between flowering plants and pollinators, and many use Sprengel's ideas and discoveries as a foundation for their own research.</p><p></p><p>

(August 28, 1889		Berlin-April 5, 1962			Hamburg)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a prominent banker who became infamous for his involvement in the Holocaust during World War II. Puhl served as the chief financial advisor to Reichsbank President, Hjalmar Schacht, before being appointed as the Reichsbank's Vice President in 1939. Puhl was also a member of the board of directors for various German banks and corporations, including IG Farben, one of the largest chemical conglomerates in the world. During the war, Puhl played a key role in financing the Nazi war effort and in overseeing the confiscation of Jewish assets. After the war, Puhl was indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg Trials, but was eventually acquitted due to a lack of evidence. Despite this, his role in facilitating the Holocaust is regarded as a stain on his legacy.</p><p>During his career, Emil Puhl held various high-ranking positions, including President of the Deutsche Reichsbank (1943-1945) and Vice President of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel (1937-1945). In his position at the Reichsbank, Puhl oversaw the implementation of policies that contributed to the devastating economic consequences of the war, including runaway inflation and the decline of the German currency. </p><p>Puhl's involvement in the Holocaust included overseeing the sale of confiscated Jewish assets, as well as the financing of concentration camps and the construction of gas chambers. He also played a role in the looting of art from Jewish-owned collections across Europe.</p><p>Following the war, Puhl was arrested and taken to Nuremberg to stand trial for his actions. He was initially sentenced to 15 years in prison, but was released in 1951 due to poor health. Puhl remained a controversial figure in post-war Germany, and his acquittal at Nuremberg was widely criticized as evidence of the flawed nature of the post-war justice system. Despite this, Puhl was never able to fully shake off the stain on his legacy that his role in the Nazi regime had caused.</p><p>Emil Puhl was born on August 28, 1889, in Berlin, Germany. Prior to his involvement with the Nazi regime, Puhl had a successful career in banking and finance. He was widely respected for his expertise in economics, and his financial acumen ultimately led to his appointment as Vice President of the Reichsbank.</p><p>During his tenure at the Reichsbank, Puhl oversaw the implementation of policies that contributed to the hyperinflation and economic instability that plagued Germany in the years leading up to World War II. He was also instrumental in securing financing for the Nazi war effort, both through traditional banking channels and through the seizure of Jewish assets.</p><p>Puhl's involvement in the Holocaust was extensive. In addition to overseeing the sale of confiscated Jewish assets, he played a role in the looting of art from Jewish-owned collections across Europe. Perhaps most infamously, Puhl was directly involved in the financing of the construction of gas chambers and other implements of mass murder.</p><p>Following the war, Puhl was arrested and charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, he was ultimately acquitted due to a lack of evidence connecting him directly to the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. Despite this, Puhl's legacy remains tainted by his involvement in the Holocaust and the Nazi war effort.</p><p></p><p>
