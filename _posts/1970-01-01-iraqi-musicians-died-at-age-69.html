						</p><p>Saddam Hussein began his political career in the 1950s, joining the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in Iraq. He became President of Iraq in 1979, and under his regime, the country became involved in the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War. Hussein was known for his aggressive policies towards neighboring countries, as well as for his brutal treatment of political dissidents and minority groups within Iraq. In 2003, Hussein was ousted from power by the United States during the Iraq War and was later captured and tried for crimes against humanity.

However, his regime was also infamous for its human rights abuses, including the use of torture and execution against political opponents and religious minorities. Additionally, many Western countries accused Hussein of pursuing a program to develop weapons of mass destruction, which was used as a justification for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Hussein continued to be a controversial figure even after his death, with some Iraqis viewing him as a hero who stood up to Western imperialism, while others see him as a dictator who caused great harm to his own people.</p><p></p><p>
