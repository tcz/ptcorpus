						Rolando Alarcón was born in Chillán, Chile and grew up in a family of musicians. He studied music and education at the University of Chile and became a teacher. Inspired by Chile's folk music, he began composing and performing his own music, often focusing on social and political issues such as poverty and injustice. He became a key figure in the nueva canción movement, which emphasized socially conscious music and lyrics, and his songs became anthems for the resistance against the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Aside from his music, Alarcón was also a dedicated teacher and worked to promote education in rural communities. He died in Mexico City at the age of 43, leaving a legacy as one of Chile's most beloved and influential musicians.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=26089309" title="Wikipedia article about Rolando Alarcón">Rolando Alarcón on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/polish-musicians-died-at-age-37.html' title='Polish musicians died at age 37'><strong>Polish musicians died at age 37</strong> List of the top 6 Polish music stars who died when they were 37</a></li><li><a href='/russian-musicians-died-at-age-49.html' title='Russian musicians died at age 49'><strong>Russian musicians died at age 49</strong> List of the top 5 Russian music stars who died when they were 49</a></li><li><a href='/ecuadorean-musicians-died-before-turning-25.html' title='Ecuadorean musicians died before turning 25'><strong>Ecuadorean musicians died before turning 25</strong> List of the top 3 Ecuadorean music stars who died before 25</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/australian-actors-died-before-turning-20.html' title='Australian actors died before turning 20'><strong>Australian actors died before turning 20</strong> List of the top 17 Australian actors who died before they turned 20</a></li><li><a href='/pakistani-actors-died-in-1959.html' title='Pakistani actors died in 1959'><strong>Pakistani actors died in 1959</strong> List of the top 1 Pakistani actors who died in 1959</a></li><li><a href='/spanish-musicians-died-at-age-29.html' title='Spanish musicians died at age 29'><strong>Spanish musicians died at age 29</strong> List of the top 2 Spanish music stars who died when they were 29</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
