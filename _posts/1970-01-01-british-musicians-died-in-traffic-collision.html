was
a British
musician and broadcaster.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work as a musicologist, particularly for his completion of Gustav Mahler's unfinished Symphony No. 10. Cooke also wrote several books and articles on music, including his influential book "The Language of Music." In addition to his musicological work, Cooke was a prominent broadcaster, presenting numerous radio programs on classical music for the BBC. He was awarded the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in 1974 for his contributions to music. Despite his many accomplishments, Cooke died at the relatively young age of 57 from a heart attack.</p><p>Cooke's interest in music began at a young age, and he went on to study at the University of Cambridge, where he earned a degree in English literature. He then pursued a career in music, focusing primarily on the works of Mahler. In addition to his completion of Mahler's Symphony No. 10, Cooke also made important contributions to the field of music theory, particularly in the area of musical form. </p><p>Cooke's work played an important role in shaping the field of musicology, particularly in the mid-20th century. He was known for his ability to communicate complex concepts to a broader audience, and his books and radio programs on music had a significant impact on both scholars and the general public. In addition to his work as a musicologist, Cooke was also an accomplished composer, although his compositions are less well-known than his scholarly work.</p><p>Despite his success in the field of musicology, Cooke was known for his modesty and lack of self-promotion. He was admired and respected by his colleagues and students, many of whom went on to have successful careers in musicology and related fields. Cooke's legacy continues to be felt today, as his work on Mahler and his contributions to the field of music theory remain influential and widely studied.</p><p></p><p>
