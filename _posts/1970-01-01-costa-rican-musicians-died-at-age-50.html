He wrote several poems, including "A la patria en peligro" (To the Country in Danger) which he composed during the War of the National Campaign. Fernández was also a passionate advocate for education and believed in the importance of modernizing the country's educational system. During his presidency, he established the National Normal School, an institution dedicated to training teachers, and increased funding for public schools. In recognition of his contributions to education, a major street in San José was named after him.
