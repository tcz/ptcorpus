was
a Moroccan
writer, singer and musician.


					</p><p>Together with his brother, he formed the musical duo Nass El Ghiwane which is considered one of the most influential groups in the history of Moroccan music. Batma's music was known for its powerful lyrics and hypnotic rhythms that addressed social and political issues in Morocco. He contributed to the development and popularization of Gnawa music, a traditional genre that blends African, Arabic, and Berber rhythms. Batma was also a prolific writer and his published works included plays, novels, and poetry. He was arrested several times by the Moroccan authorities for his political activism and lived in exile for a period of time. His legacy lives on as his music continues to inspire and influence artists in Morocco and beyond.</p><p>Batma's passion for music and activism began in his early years when he joined a political and cultural youth movement. He was influenced by early rock and roll and African rhythms that he heard on the radio. With his brother, he formed Nass El Ghiwane in the late 1960s and released their first album in 1973. The group's unique sound and powerful lyrics quickly gained a following, and they became known as the "Rolling Stones of Africa" and "the voice of the voiceless."</p><p>Batma's influence on Gnawa music was particularly significant. He was one of the first to incorporate Gnawa rhythms into his music and to perform them in public. He played the guembri, a three-stringed bass instrument traditionally used in Gnawa music. His music and activism brought attention to the Gnawa people and their culture, which had been ignored and marginalized by mainstream society.</p><p>In addition to his music, Batma was also a prolific writer. He published several plays that were critical of the Moroccan government and its policies. One of his most well-known plays, "The Love of the Soldier," was banned by the authorities. Batma was also a skilled poet and his poems were often set to music.</p><p>Batma's political activism and outspokenness led to his arrest several times by the Moroccan authorities. In 1981, he was exiled to France, where he continued to perform and write. He returned to Morocco in 1996 but passed away the following year on his 50th birthday. Today, he is remembered as a cultural icon and a voice for the oppressed.</p><p>His contribution to Moroccan music and culture was recognized posthumously when he was awarded the Medal of Honor by King Mohammed VI in 2006. Batma's legacy has also been celebrated through various cultural and artistic events in Morocco, including the annual Essaouira Gnawa and World Music Festival. Nass El Ghiwane's music continues to be popular and relevant, with their songs being covered by different artists across the world. Batma's dedication to social justice and human rights has inspired a new generation of artists in Morocco and beyond to use their music and platform to address critical issues affecting their societies. Through his music and activism, Batma left an indelible mark on the Moroccan music industry and his influence continues to inspire and transform the lives of many.</p><p></p><p>
