He wrote several novels and short stories, including "Orages" (Storms) which was published in 1978. Poujouly was a member of the French Resistance during World War II, and he remained politically active throughout his life. He was a member of the French Socialist Party and, in the 1980s, he served in the city council of Montreuil, a suburb of Paris. Poujouly was also a painter and his artwork was exhibited in several galleries.</p><p>Georges Poujouly's acting career spanned almost three decades, during which he appeared in over 40 films, television shows, and theater productions. In addition to his work in French cinema, he also appeared in several international productions, including the Italian film "Accattone" (1961) and the British-Australian film "Robbery Under Arms" (1957). Poujouly's performance in "Les Quatre Cents Coups" remains one of the most iconic roles in French cinema history and earned him critical acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival.</p><p>Beyond his artistic pursuits, Poujouly was known for his political activism and support for progressive causes. He was a vocal advocate for workers' rights, social justice, and nuclear disarmament. Poujouly was also a committed environmentalist and worked to promote sustainable agriculture and renewable energy.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Georges Poujouly's contributions to French culture and society continue to be celebrated by his fans and peers. His legacy as a multi-talented artist and dedicated humanitarian endures to this day.</p><p></p><p>
