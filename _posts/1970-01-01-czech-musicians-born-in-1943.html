(April 28, 1943		Prague-)


is
a Czech
musician.


						</p><p>He is best known for being a founding member and saxophonist of the influential Czech rock band The Plastic People of the Universe. Brabenec joined the band in 1969, and performed with them until their disbandment in 1988. He was also a key member of the band Pulnoc in the 1990s. Brabenec's unique style of saxophone playing has been praised for its versatility and expressiveness, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the Czech underground music scene. In addition to his musical work, Brabenec has also collaborated on numerous visual art projects, and has exhibited his artwork in galleries throughout Europe. He continues to perform and create art to this day.</p><p>Brabenec's musical career began at the age of 17 when he formed his first band, The Primitives. His interest in jazz and blues led him to join The Plastic People of the Universe, where he played the saxophone and provided backing vocals. The band's unconventional music and lyrics often brought them into conflict with the authorities, and they were seen as a symbol of the underground cultural and political resistance in Czechoslovakia.</p><p>After The Plastic People of the Universe disbanded, Brabenec continued to perform with various other musicians, including Pulnoc, which he co-founded in the early 1990s. The band was known for its experimental sound and incorporated elements of jazz and world music into their music.</p><p>Brabenec's work as a visual artist is often characterized by his use of collage and text, and his work has been exhibited in a number of solo and group exhibitions. He has also collaborated on several documentary films and theatrical productions.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to Czech culture, Brabenec was awarded the Medal of Merit by the Czech Republic in 2018. He remains an active performer and artist, and continues to inspire generations of musicians and artists in the Czech Republic and beyond.</p><p>Brabenec's style of saxophone playing has been described as experimental and unique, with a sound that ranges from delicate and lyrical to harsh and abrasive. He often used various extended techniques on his instrument, such as circular breathing, multiphonics, and overblowing, which allowed him to produce a wide range of tones and textures. Brabenec was also known for his use of electronic effects and amplification, which added an extra dimension to his sound.</p><p>In addition to his musical and artistic endeavors, Brabenec has been active in politics and social causes. He was a member of the Civic Forum, a political movement that played a key role in the Velvet Revolution of 1989, which brought an end to Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. Brabenec also supported various human rights and environmental campaigns, and was involved in efforts to preserve and promote the legacy of the Czech underground culture.</p><p>Brabenec's influence on the Czech music scene and beyond cannot be overstated. He was a pioneer of experimental rock and jazz, and his collaborations with other artists have helped to shape the course of Czech cultural history. Brabenec's ability to bridge different artistic disciplines - from music to visual art to theater - has made him a truly multidimensional artist, and his legacy continues to inspire generations of creators around the world.</p><p>Brabenec's impact on Czech culture has been recognized with numerous awards and accolades. In addition to the Medal of Merit, he received the František Kriegel Award for his contribution to freedom and democracy in 2018. He was also the first recipient of the Karel Kryl Award, named after the renowned Czech singer-songwriter and political activist. In 2019, Brabenec was included in the Czech edition of Rolling Stone magazine's list of "100 Greatest Czech Musicians of All Time".</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Brabenec remains humble and committed to his craft. He continues to collaborate with other artists and experiment with new forms of expression, always pushing the boundaries of what is possible in music and art. For Brabenec, the most important thing is to stay true to himself and his vision, and to inspire others to do the same.</p><p></p><p>
