(January 14, 1925		Shinjuku-November 25, 1970			Ichigaya)

	
		also known as Kimitaké Hiraoka

	
was
a Japanese
poet, essayist, writer, novelist, playwright and author.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Noriko Tomita and Iichiro Hiraoka.

						</p><p>Mishima is widely regarded as one of the most important Japanese writers of the 20th century. He is especially known for his exploration of themes such as sexuality, death, and the relationship between the individual and society, as well as his use of traditional Japanese literary forms such as kabuki theater and Noh drama in his writing. Mishima was also a well-known political and social activist, and he famously staged a failed coup attempt in 1970 in which he and a group of followers attempted to take over a Japanese military base and inspire a popular uprising against the government. His death by ritual suicide, or seppuku, immediately after the coup attempt shocked the world and made him a controversial figure. Nevertheless, his literary legacy has endured, and his works continue to be widely read and studied in Japan and around the world.</p><p>Mishima was born into an aristocratic family and spent much of his childhood training in martial arts and traditional Japanese practices. He went on to study law at the University of Tokyo, but ultimately dropped out to pursue writing full-time. His first major success as a writer came with the publication of his novel "Confessions of a Mask" in 1949, which explored themes of homosexuality and the masks people wear in society.</p><p>Throughout his career, Mishima authored over 40 novels, numerous plays, and several collections of short stories and essays. He received numerous accolades for his work, including the Tanizaki Prize and the Kawabata Prize. Some of his most famous works include "The Sea of Fertility" tetralogy, "Spring Snow," and "The Temple of the Golden Pavilion."</p><p>Beyond his literary pursuits, Mishima was a controversial figure due to his extreme nationalist and traditionalist views. He spoke out against the Westernization of Japan and advocated for a return to traditional values, including the samurai code of bushido. Mishima's political views drove him to stage his coup attempt and ultimately commit seppuku in a dramatic and highly publicized manner.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his death and political views, Mishima's contributions to Japanese literature and culture continue to be celebrated and studied to this day. His legacy as a writer and activist remains a powerful influence on Japanese society and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in suicide.

(February 28, 1864		Tokyo-May 10, 1909			Bay of Bengal)


was
a Japanese
writer.


					</p><p>Futabatei Shimei was one of the pioneers of modern Japanese literature and is best known for his novel Ukigumo (The Drifting Cloud), which was published in 1887 and is widely considered a masterpiece of naturalistic fiction. He was heavily influenced by Western literature and was one of the first Japanese writers to adopt a realistic and psychological approach to writing. As a translator, he worked on translating Western classics such as Nikolai Gogol's Dead Souls into Japanese. He also played an important role in the development of modern Japanese literary criticism, and his essays on literature and culture continue to be studied today. Despite dying at a relatively young age, Futabatei Shimei's contributions to Japanese literature have had a lasting impact on the development of modern Japanese literature.</p><p>After finishing his education at Tokyo University in 1886, Futabatei Shimei went to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where he served as a translator at the Japanese embassy. During this time, he immersed himself in Russian literature and was particularly interested in the works of Ivan Turgenev. Upon returning to Japan, he began writing Ukigumo, which was partly based on his experiences in Russia. </p><p>In addition to his literary and translation work, Futabatei Shimei also worked as a journalist, writing for several newspapers and magazines, including Kokumin Shinbun and Bungei Kurabu. He was a proponent of democratic ideals and was critical of the traditional social hierarchy in Japanese society. </p><p>Today, Futabatei Shimei is remembered as one of the most important figures in the development of modern Japanese literature. His naturalistic style and psychological realism influenced subsequent generations of Japanese writers, and his contributions to literary criticism helped to establish a more sophisticated understanding of literature in Japan.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of tuberculosis.

(May 30, 1824		Yamaguchi-December 7, 1869			Osaka)


was
a Japanese
politician.


					</p><p>He played a key role in the modernization of Japan during the Meiji period, serving as a military strategist and a vocal advocate for the adoption of Western military technology. He is particularly known for his efforts to establish a modern army, promoting the training of soldiers in Western tactics and the acquisition of modern weaponry, including rifles and artillery. He also worked tirelessly to establish a national system of education, advocating for the establishment of schools that would teach Western science and technology alongside traditional Japanese subjects. Despite facing opposition from some conservatives who opposed Western influence, Ōmura remained a respected and influential figure until his death in 1869. Today, he is remembered as one of the leading figures of the Meiji Restoration, and his legacy can be seen in the modernization of Japan that took place during this period.</p><p>Ōmura Masujirō was born into a samurai family in Yamaguchi and began his career as a low-ranking official in the Tokugawa shogunate. However, after witnessing the arrival of Western ships in Japan and the technological superiority of Western nations, he became convinced of the need for Japan to modernize its military and adopt Western technology in order to defend itself against foreign powers. In addition to his role as a military strategist and advocate for modernization, Ōmura also served as an influential political figure, helping to draft the 1868 Meiji Constitution and serving as a member of the first Japanese Diet. Despite his many accomplishments, Ōmura’s legacy remains somewhat controversial, as some historians criticize his involvement in the development of the Japanese military, which was later used to wage wars of aggression against other nations during the early 20th century. However, others point to his early advocacy for modernization and defense as evidence of his commitment to protecting Japan and promoting its long-term prosperity.</p><p></p><p>
