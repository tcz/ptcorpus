							Born into an Armenian family, Ruben Simonov was a prominent figure in the Soviet cultural scene. He served as the artistic director of the Vakhtangov Theatre for over 20 years, during which he pursued a distinctive style of direction characterized by a bold and dynamic approach to staging classical plays. Simonov was also a successful actor, best known for his roles in films such as "The Return of Maxim" (1937) and "Pirogov" (1947), which won him the Stalin Prize. In addition to his work in theatre and cinema, Ruben Simonov was a respected theatre critic and essayist. He authored several books on theatre theory and practice, and his writing on the history of Soviet theatre remains a valuable resource to this day. Simonov received numerous awards and honours for his contributions to the arts, including the Order of Lenin and the title of People's Artist of the USSR. Despite his achievements, Simonov's career was not without controversy. In the 1930s he was criticized for his perceived formalism, and his close association with the Vakhtangov Theatre was seen by some as evidence of his transgression against socialist realist principles. Despite this, Simonov remained a prominent and influential figure in Soviet theatre until his death in 1968.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=15543141" title="Wikipedia article about Ruben Simonov">Ruben Simonov on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/polish-actresses-died-in-2011.html' title='Polish actresses died in 2011'><strong>Polish actresses died in 2011</strong> List of the top 1 Polish actresses who died in 2011</a></li><li><a href='/croatian-actresses-died-in-2005.html' title='Croatian actresses died in 2005'><strong>Croatian actresses died in 2005</strong> List of the top 1 Croatian actresses who died in 2005</a></li><li><a href='/croatian-actors-died-in-1967.html' title='Croatian actors died in 1967'><strong>Croatian actors died in 1967</strong> List of the top 1 Croatian actors who died in 1967</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/mexican-actors-died-in-1993.html' title='Mexican actors died in 1993'><strong>Mexican actors died in 1993</strong> List of the top 2 Mexican actors who died in 1993</a></li><li><a href='/south-korean-actors-died-in-cerebral-infarction.html' title='South Korean actors died in Cerebral infarction'><strong>South Korean actors died in Cerebral infarction</strong> List of the top 1 South Korean actors who died in Cerebral infarction</a></li><li><a href='/dutch-actors-died-before-turning-20.html' title='Dutch actors died before turning 20'><strong>Dutch actors died before turning 20</strong> List of the top 2 Dutch actors who died before they turned 20</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
