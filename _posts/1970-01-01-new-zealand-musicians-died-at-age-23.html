writer and playwright.


					</p><p>Thompson began his career as a playwright in the mid-1960s, and quickly gained recognition for his innovative style and thought-provoking themes. Many of his works drew on his experiences growing up in rural New Zealand, and explored issues of identity, social class, and cultural heritage. Some of his most notable plays include "Coaltown Blues," "The Songmaker's Chair," and "Promised Land."

Despite these challenges, Thompson showed a talent for writing from a young age and was encouraged by his teachers to pursue his passion.</p><p>After completing his education, Thompson worked a series of odd jobs before eventually moving to Auckland in the early 1960s. It was there that he began to make a name for himself as a playwright, with "Coaltown Blues" being his breakout hit in 1968. The play, which is set in a coal mining town similar to Kaitangata, explored themes of alienation and social isolation in a changing world.</p><p>Over the next few decades, Thompson continued to write plays, poems, and essays that dealt with issues of identity, race, and social justice. He was known for his willingness to tackle difficult and controversial topics, and his work remains relevant today.</p><p>While Thompson's mental health struggles were well-known to those close to him, he kept them largely hidden from the public. His suicide on his 60th birthday was a shock to many in the arts community, and his death was seen as a tragic loss for New Zealand culture.</p><p>Despite the sadness of his premature death, Thompson's contributions to New Zealand literature and theater continue to be celebrated. In addition to the many awards he received during his lifetime, he was posthumously honored with the Order of New Zealand in 2018, the highest civilian honor in the country.</p><p>Thompson's impact on New Zealand theater has been profound, and his work has had a lasting influence on the country's cultural landscape. Many of his plays continue to be performed today, and his legacy has inspired a new generation of playwrights to explore the complex issues that he tackled in his work.</p><p>In addition to his artistic achievements, Thompson was also known for his activism on behalf of minority groups in New Zealand. He was a vocal advocate for MƒÅori rights and was involved in the anti-nuclear movement in the 1980s.</p><p>Thompson's personal life was marked by tragedy and struggle, but his dedication to his craft and his commitment to social justice has ensured that his legacy lives on. He remains an important figure in the history of New Zealand literature and theater, and his impact will continue to be felt for years to come.</p><p></p><p>
