(October 10, 1757		Gävle-August 14, 1819			Vadstena)


was
a Swedish
physician and botanist.


					</p><p>He is recognized as the father of lichenology, the scientific study of lichens. Acharius coined the term "lichen" and developed a system for classifying and naming lichens that is still used today. He published his landmark work "Lichenographia Universalis" in 1803, which described and illustrated over 3000 species of lichens. Acharius also made significant contributions to the study of mosses and liverworts, and published several works on the subject. His work was instrumental in establishing the study of cryptogamic botany, which includes mosses, lichens, and other non-flowering plants. During his lifetime, Acharius was recognized as one of the most prominent naturalists in Europe, and his legacy continues to influence the study of botany today.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Erik Acharius was also a respected physician in Sweden. He received his medical degree from Uppsala University and later served as a physician in Vadstena, where he spent the rest of his life. Acharius was a member of several scientific societies, including the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Linnean Society of London. He corresponded with other prominent scientists of his time, including Carl Linnaeus, and his work was highly regarded by his peers. Acharius' classification system for lichens is still in use today, and his contributions to the study of botany have had a lasting impact on the field.</p><p>In addition to his work in botany and medicine, Erik Acharius was also a linguist and scholar. He was fluent in several languages including Latin, Greek, and German, and was known for his translations of scientific works from other languages into Swedish. Acharius' interest in languages also led him to study the Finnish language, and he published a Finnish-Swedish dictionary in 1790. Acharius' contributions to the study of lichens and other non-flowering plants helped to lay the foundation for modern botany and his work is still studied and referenced by botanists around the world today.</p><p></p><p>
