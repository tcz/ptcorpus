(February 14, 1886		Ponferrada-December 11, 1937			Begues)

	
		a.k.a. Angel Pestana

	
was
a Spanish
journalist and politician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his activism in the Spanish labor movement during the early 20th century, particularly his role in founding the anarcho-syndicalist trade union, the National Confederation of Labor (CNT) in 1910.

He also wrote several books, including "The Anarchist Collectives: Workers' Self-management in the Spanish Revolution 1936-1939", which remains an important historical account of the movement.</p><p>Pestaña's life was cut short when he was executed by firing squad in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Though he had initially aligned himself with the Republican side, he became disillusioned with the government's growing authoritarianism and repression of anarchist groups. His legacy, however, continues to inspire generations of activists and scholars interested in the history of anarchism and labor movements.</p><p>Through his work within the CNT, Pestaña played a crucial role in shaping the labor movement in Spain, advocating for workers' rights and organizing strikes against exploitative employers. He was also involved in the creation of the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (Iberian Anarchist Federation) in 1927 and remained an active member until his death.Pestaña's writing is notable for its commitment to anarchist principles as well as its insights into the social and political landscape of his era. His work helped to popularize anarchist ideas among a broader audience and provided a compelling case for the use of direct action and grassroots organizing as a means of achieving social change. Despite the political turmoil of his time, Pestaña remained committed to his ideals until the end of his life, and his lasting impact on the labor movement in Spain is a testament to his enduring legacy as an activist and writer.</p><p>Pestaña's activism in the labor movement began at an early age. He started working as a miner at the age of 14 and quickly became involved in trade union activities, later joining the anarcho-syndicalist group, Solidaridad Obrera. Pestaña played an active role in organizing strikes and protests, advocating for better working conditions and fair wages for workers across Spain.</p><p>In addition to his work in the labor movement, Pestaña was also involved in the anarchist movement more broadly. He participated in the Barcelona general strike of 1917 and was involved in the creation of the Iberian Anarchist Federation, an organization dedicated to promoting anarchist principles and organizing grassroots activism across the region.</p><p>Despite his importance as a figure in the anarchist and socialist movements, Pestaña's life and legacy were largely ignored during the Franco dictatorship. It was not until the transition to democracy in Spain in the 1970s that his work began to be reclaimed and celebrated by activists and scholars. Today, Pestaña is recognized as one of the most important figures in the history of anarchism in Spain, and his contributions to the labor movement and the fight for workers' rights continue to inspire activists around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1170		Caleruega-August 6, 1221			Bologna)

	
		also known as St. Dominic, Dominic de Guzmán, Dominic of Osma, Domingo Félix de Guzmán, St. Dominic, Confessor, St. Dominic De Guzman, Saint Dominic De Guzman or Dominic

	
was
a Spanish
personality.


					</p><p>He was the founder of the Dominican Order, and his life and work were devoted to spreading the faith through preaching and teaching. Born into a noble family, Dominic studied theology and became a priest. He traveled extensively throughout Europe, preaching to the common people in their own languages. His message focused on the need to embrace poverty, repentance, and the love of God. </p><p>Dominic founded the Order of Preachers in 1216, with the approval of Pope Honorius III. This new religious order was dedicated to preaching, spreading the word of God, and actively engaging in the world. The Dominicans quickly became known for their intellectual rigor, their dedication to education, and their opposition to heresy. </p><p>Saint Dominic is remembered for his holiness, his kindness, and his self-sacrifice. He died in 1221, and was canonized by Pope Gregory IX just three years later. Today, the Dominicans continue to serve the church and the world through education, social justice work, and evangelization.</p><p>Saint Dominic was born in the Castilian village of Caleruega, in present-day Spain, in 1170. He was the youngest son of Felix de Guzman, a wealthy landlord, and Jane of Aza, a pious woman who had prayed for years to have a child. Even as a boy, Dominic was known for his generosity and compassion towards the poor.</p><p>At the age of 14, he went to Palencia to study theology and the liberal arts. It was here that Dominic experienced a profound conversion, which led him to embrace a life of poverty and self-denial. He joined the Canons Regular of Osma, a community of Augustinian monks who lived a life of prayer, study, and ministry.</p><p>In 1203, he accompanied his bishop to Denmark, where he spent four years trying to convert the pagan tribes of the region. Although he was not entirely successful, this experience helped him to understand the importance of preaching the Gospel in the vernacular. He went on to preach throughout Europe, from France to Italy, and from Spain to the Holy Land.</p><p>In 1215, he participated in the Fourth Lateran Council, which discussed many of the problems facing the Catholic Church at that time. It was here that he first conceived of the idea of founding a new religious order dedicated to preaching and the salvation of souls. The Dominicans, as they came to be called, were officially founded in 1216, with the approval of Pope Honorius III.</p><p>The Dominicans quickly became known for their commitment to education and scholarship, and for their opposition to heresy. They developed a distinctive approach to preaching, which emphasized the use of reason and dialogue in their interactions with people of other faiths. The order grew rapidly, and by the time of Saint Dominic's death in 1221, there were already over 60 priories throughout Europe.</p><p>Saint Dominic was canonized by Pope Gregory IX in 1234. Today, Dominicans continue to serve the church and the world through their various ministries, which include teaching, social justice work, and pastoral care. They remain an important force within the Catholic Church, and their founder's legacy continues to inspire countless people around the world.</p><p>Saint Dominic is also known for his devotion to the Virgin Mary. He believed that Mary played a crucial role in our salvation and made it a priority to promote her veneration throughout Europe. He also founded the first Marian shrine in Prouille, France, which became a center of devotion to Mary in the region.</p><p>In addition to his emphasis on preaching and education, Saint Dominic was also known for his personal holiness and austerity. He lived a simple life, wearing a rough habit and sleeping on the ground. He fasted regularly and spent many hours in prayer and meditation.</p><p>Saint Dominic's influence on the Catholic Church has been significant. His order, the Dominicans, played a major role in the Inquisition, as they were often charged with rooting out heresy. However, in modern times, the Dominicans have focused more on education and social justice work, and less on punitive measures.</p><p>Today, Saint Dominic is remembered as a model of holiness and evangelization. His commitment to preaching and education continue to inspire Catholics around the world, and his legacy lives on through the many religious communities that he founded.</p><p></p><p>
