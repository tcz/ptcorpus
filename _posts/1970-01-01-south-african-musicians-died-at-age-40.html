					</p><p>John Frederick McCrea was born in Chennai (formerly Madras), India, to Scottish parents. He grew up in South Africa and became a soldier in the British Army. He served in several conflicts, including the Basuto War and the Bechuanaland Expedition, and rose to the rank of captain. He was known for his bravery and leadership skills on the battlefield.</p><p>In addition to his military career, McCrea was also an accomplished amateur artist. He painted watercolors of African landscapes and wildlife, which were exhibited in London and South Africa. After his death, his paintings were donated to the South African National Gallery in Cape Town.</p><p>McCrea was married to Lavinia Lumsden, who later became a prominent suffragette and women's rights activist in South Africa. They had three children together. McCrea's sudden death at the age of 40 was a shock to his family and colleagues in the army. He was remembered as a skilled soldier and talented artist who made significant contributions to South African history.</p><p>McCrea's military career began in 1878 when he joined the Cape Mounted Rifles, a British colonial regiment. He participated in multiple campaigns across Southern Africa, including the First Boer War, the Sekhukhune War, and the Anglo-Zulu War. During the latter, he served under General Lord Chelmsford and was present at the Battle of Ulundi, the final major engagement of the conflict. McCrea's actions during the battle earned him a Mention in Dispatches, a military award for bravery and distinguished service.</p><p>Aside from his military duties, McCrea was an avid wildlife enthusiast and spent much of his free time hunting and exploring the South African wilderness. He was especially interested in the birdlife of the region and became a recognized expert on the subject. He published several articles on birdwatching in the Cape Times and other newspapers.</p><p>In his later years, McCrea became increasingly involved in the political affairs of South Africa. He was a supporter of the British colonial government and opposed the rising tide of Afrikaner nationalism. He was also an advocate for the rights of indigenous peoples and frequently spoke out against the mistreatment of black South Africans.</p><p>Today, McCrea is remembered as one of the most distinguished soldiers and artists of his generation. His paintings remain popular among collectors and his military career is studied by historians and military scholars.</p><p>McCrea's legacy also includes his contribution to the creation of the South African Constabulary, a paramilitary force established in the aftermath of the Second Boer War. He was appointed to lead the force, which was tasked with maintaining law and order in the newly annexed territories of Transvaal and Orange River Colony. McCrea was praised for his efforts in establishing a disciplined and professional force, despite facing several challenges and setbacks.</p><p>In addition to his military and artistic pursuits, McCrea was also a keen sportsman. He played cricket and rugby, and was a member of the South African cricket team that toured England in 1888. He was known for his aggressive style of play, both on and off the field, and was a popular figure among fans and teammates.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, McCrea's life was cut short by his untimely death in 1894. He was buried with full military honors at Cape Town's Plumstead Cemetery, and his grave remains a site of pilgrimage for military historians and enthusiasts. Today, his contributions to South African history are remembered through various memorials and plaques, including a monument at the site of the Battle of Ulundi.</p><p>John Frederick McCrea's contributions to South African history continue to be celebrated and studied today.

Despite his premature death, McCrea's impact on South African history and culture remains significant.</p><p>McCrea's legacy also includes his involvement in the establishment of the South African Ornithological Society in 1890. He served as the society's first president and played a key role in organizing birdwatching expeditions and promoting the study of avian life in South Africa. The society continues to be active today and has contributed greatly to our understanding of South African birds and their habitats.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to military, artistic, sporting, and scientific endeavors, McCrea was also a devoted family man. He was deeply devoted to his wife Lavinia and their children and was known for his kindness and generosity towards those around him. In his diaries and letters home, he often expressed his love for his family and his hope for a better future for all South Africans.</p><p>McCrea's life and work continue to inspire many today.
