farmer.


					</p><p>Stanley Graham became infamous for a shooting spree that took place on November 8, 1941. He had been involved in a long-standing dispute with government agencies over land use and had become increasingly isolated and paranoid. He set up fortified positions on his farm and shot and killed four policemen and a civilian before being killed in a gunfight with more than 80 police officers. The incident, known as the "Kohitere Tragedy," was a national shock and led to changes in how the police were armed and trained. Despite his violent actions, Graham became a controversial figure, with some dubbing him a martyr and others calling him a murderer.</p><p></p><p>
