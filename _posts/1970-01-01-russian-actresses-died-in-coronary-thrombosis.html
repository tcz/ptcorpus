							Born in Yalta, in the Crimean Peninsula, Alla Nazimova was the daughter of Jewish parents who owned a hotel.

She went on to star in many successful silent films, including "Salom√©" (1923), which she also produced and helped write the screenplay for. However, as the film industry transitioned to sound, Nazimova struggled to adjust and her career declined.</p><p>Aside from her acting career, Nazimova was known for her unconventional lifestyle and relationships. She was openly bisexual and had relationships with many notable figures, including writer Mercedes de Acosta and actress Eva Le Gallienne. Nazimova's mansion in Hollywood, known as "The Garden of Allah," was a popular gathering spot for artists and bohemians in the 1920s.</p><p>Despite her fame and success in the early years of Hollywood, Nazimova's later years were marked by financial difficulties and health problems.
