In the early 1940s, she gained national attention as a vocalist in some of the top nightclubs in the country. In 1954, Dandridge became the first African American woman to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the film "Carmen Jones."</p><p>Despite her success, Dandridge faced significant discrimination and struggled to find work in Hollywood.
