an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>Ernst Künz was a member of the resistance against the Nazi regime in Austria during World War II.

He is remembered as a hero who sacrificed his life for the cause of freedom and democracy.</p><p>Ernst Künz was born in Vienna, Austria in 1912. He became involved in anti-Nazi activism at a young age, inspired by his father's socialist values. Künz joined the O5 resistance group, which was led by Austrian philosopher and political activist Otto Neurath. The group focused on spreading anti-Nazi propaganda, organizing underground meetings, and planning a resistance movement that would support an Allied invasion of Austria.</p><p>Künz was arrested by the Gestapo in 1944 and was subjected to severe torture during interrogation. Despite this, he refused to provide any information about the O5 group or its activities. He was eventually sentenced to death by hanging, along with his fellow resistance members.</p><p>The execution of Ernst Künz and the other members of the O5 group was a significant blow to the resistance movement in Austria, but it also served as a rallying cry for others who wanted to fight against Nazi rule.

Künz's legacy as a resistance fighter was not fully appreciated until after the war, when his story was rediscovered and celebrated by later generations.
