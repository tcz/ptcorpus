(February 10, 1964		Quetta-November 14, 2002			Greensville Correctional Center)

	
		also known as Mir Aimal Kansi or Aimal Kasi

	
was
a Pakistani
personality.


					</p><p>He was responsible for carrying out the 1993 ambush shooting outside the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) headquarters at Langley, Virginia, which resulted in the deaths of two CIA employees. Kansi fled to Pakistan after the attack and was later arrested by Pakistani authorities in 1997. Following a controversial extradition process, he was brought back to the United States to stand trial and was subsequently sentenced to death. Kansi was executed by lethal injection at Greensville Correctional Center in 2002. His case attracted international attention and sparked debate about the use of the death penalty and the extradition of criminal suspects.</p><p>Mir Aimal Kasi was born in Quetta, Pakistan in 1964. He grew up in poverty and worked odd jobs before becoming involved with militant groups. In 1993, he carried out the shooting outside the CIA headquarters, citing US foreign policy in the Middle East as his motive.</p><p>After the attack, Kansi fled to Pakistan and was able to live freely for several years. However, in 1997 he was finally arrested by Pakistani authorities and extradited to the United States to stand trial.</p><p>During his trial, Kansi became known for his erratic behavior and outbursts in court. Nevertheless, he was found guilty and sentenced to death.</p><p>Kansi's case sparked controversy due to the circumstances surrounding his extradition and the use of the death penalty. Some argued that his extradition violated international law, while others argued that he deserved the harshest punishment for his crimes.</p><p>Despite appeals and international pressure, Kansi was ultimately executed by lethal injection at Greensville Correctional Center in 2002. His case remains a controversial and divisive topic to this day.</p><p>After Kansi's execution, his family in Pakistan held a funeral for him where they claimed that he was innocent of the charges and had been handed over to the United States as part of a political deal. This claim, however, was not substantiated.</p><p>The Kansi case was also cited as a reason for increased security measures around government agencies and buildings, particularly in the Washington D.C. area. The shooting led to the installation of concrete barriers and other physical security measures around the CIA headquarters.</p><p>Kansi's attack on the CIA headquarters was not an isolated incident. In 1995, a car bomb outside a federal building in Oklahoma City killed 168 people and injured hundreds more. In both cases, the perpetrators cited opposition to U.S. foreign policy as their motive for the attacks. These incidents highlighted the growing threat of domestic and foreign terrorism in the United States in the 1990s.</p><p>Mir Aimal Kasi's attack on the CIA headquarters was a significant event in the history of anti-American terrorism. Born into a family of ethnic Pashtuns, Kansi was raised in extreme poverty and dropped out of school without completing his education. He later traveled to Afghanistan to participate in the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union in the 1980s.</p><p>Kansi returned to Pakistan after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and became increasingly disillusioned with the corruption and dysfunction of his homeland. He was drawn to the teachings of radical Islamist groups and was particularly critical of the United States' support for corrupt regimes in the Middle East.</p><p>Kansi's attack on the CIA headquarters was carefully planned and executed. He parked his car outside the building's entrance and opened fire with an assault rifle, killing two CIA employees and injuring three others. Kansi then fled the scene and evaded capture for several years.</p><p>Kansi's extradition to the United States was a deeply controversial process. Pakistani officials initially refused to hand him over, citing concerns about the fairness of the American legal system and the use of the death penalty. However, under pressure from the United States, Pakistan eventually agreed to extradite Kansi in exchange for economic and political incentives.</p><p>Kansi's trial and subsequent execution reignited debate about the use of the death penalty and the fairness of the American justice system. Critics argued that Kansi's trial was marred by procedural errors and that his execution was inhumane and unjustified. Others argued that Kansi's attack represented a grave threat to American national security and that he deserved the harshest possible punishment.</p><p>Regardless of one's position on Kansi's case, it remains a sobering reminder of the ongoing threat posed by terrorism and the importance of international cooperation in combating violent extremism.</p><p>Mir Aimal Kansi's attack on the CIA headquarters was a turning point in the US government's approach to security measures. His shooting prompted the government to re-evaluate and enhance security measures around government buildings, particularly in Washington D.C. and other major cities. The installation of bollards, concrete barriers, and other physical security measures became more common in public spaces. The attack also led to increased public awareness of potential threats from both domestic and foreign terrorism, and the importance of being vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity.</p><p>Kansi's case had a profound impact on US-Pakistani relations. While some in Pakistan saw him as a martyr and a symbol of resistance against American imperialism, others saw his attack as an act of terrorism and harmful to Pakistan's image abroad. The extradition of Kansi strained the relationship between the two countries and highlighted the challenges of international cooperation in matters of law enforcement and counterterrorism.</p><p>In the years since Kansi's execution, the world has witnessed several other high-profile terrorist attacks, including the September 11th attacks in 2001 and the 2015 attacks in Paris. While the tactics and motives of these attacks differed, they serve as a reminder of the ongoing threat posed by extremist ideology and the importance of international cooperation in countering terrorism.</p><p>Mir Aimal Kansi's legacy is a complicated one. While his attack on the CIA headquarters was a tragic and horrific event, it also prompted a critical examination of US security measures and underscored the need for greater international cooperation in combating terrorism. Kansi's extradition and subsequent execution remain a contentious issue, with some arguing that his trial was unfair and his execution inhumane, while others argue that he deserved the harshest possible punishment for his crimes.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1974		Bannu District-August 5, 2009			South Waziristan)


was
a Pakistani
warlord.


					</p><p>Baitullah Mehsud was the founder and leader of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, a militant group that has been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and suicide bombings in Pakistan. He was known for his fierce opposition to the Pakistani government and his close ties to Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda. Mehsud was born in the Bannu District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and belonged to the Mehsud tribe. He received little formal education and rose to prominence as a militant leader during the Afghan War. Over the years, he was accused of masterminding a number of high-profile attacks, including the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Despite his notoriety, Mehsud remained an elusive target for Pakistani and American forces for many years before ultimately succumbing to illness in 2009.</p><p>Mehsud began his militant career in the late 1990s when he formed a group to fight against the Taliban. However, he later joined the Taliban and became an ally of Mullah Omar. After the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, Mehsud fled to Pakistan and began to build his own militant group, which eventually became the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The TTP aimed to establish a strict Islamic state in Pakistan and carried out attacks against both Pakistani military and civilian targets.</p><p>Mehsud was known for his charismatic personality and his ability to inspire loyalty among his followers. He also had a reputation for being ruthless, and was accused of ordering the execution of opponents and suspected informants. Despite his notoriety, he remained a popular figure among some Pashtuns in Pakistan, who saw him as a resistance leader fighting against the Pakistani government and its US allies.</p><p>Mehsud's death was seen as a significant blow to the TTP, although the group continued to carry out attacks in Pakistan for many years afterwards. His successor, Hakimullah Mehsud, was also killed in a US drone strike in 2013. Today, the TTP remains a potent force in Pakistan, although it has been weakened by infighting and the loss of many of its senior leaders.</p><p>Mehsud was also known for his involvement in the opium trade, which he used to finance his militant activities. He controlled a major portion of the opium trade in the tribal regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and his group levied taxes on opium farmers and drug smugglers. The TTP's involvement in the drug trade helped to fuel their insurgency and undermine the stability of the region.Mehsud's death was controversial, with some conspiracy theories suggesting that he was actually killed by a rival group or elements within the Pakistani government. However, the US government officially confirmed that Mehsud was killed in a drone strike in South Waziristan on August 5, 2009. His death was welcomed by the Pakistani government and the US, which saw him as one of the most dangerous terrorists in the region. Nonetheless, his legacy continues to be felt in Pakistan, where the TTP and other militant groups continue to carry out attacks and destabilize the country.</p><p>In addition to his involvement with the Taliban and the TTP, Baitullah Mehsud was also known for his role in supporting other militant groups in the region. He provided financial and material support to groups like the Haqqani network and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which have carried out attacks in Afghanistan and India, respectively. Mehsud was also believed to have close ties to the Pakistani intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which some experts have suggested may have given him protection in exchange for his support of their strategic goals.</p><p>Mehsud's death was seen as a significant milestone in the fight against terrorism in Pakistan, and it marked a major victory for the US drone program, which had been criticized for its controversial use of targeted killings. However, his death also highlighted the challenges of dealing with militant groups that operate across borders and have deep roots within local communities. The TTP and its affiliated groups have continued to carry out attacks in Pakistan, and the country remains one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists, activists, and religious minorities.</p><p>Despite his notorious reputation as a ruthless militant leader, Baitullah Mehsud was also known for his philanthropic efforts. He established several welfare programs, including schools and hospitals, in the areas under his control. These programs helped to win him support among some locals, who saw him as a leader who was working to improve their lives. Some experts have suggested that Mehsud's charity work was a way of winning hearts and minds, and that it allowed him to maintain his power and influence in the region.</p><p>Mehsud's death in 2009 was followed by a power struggle within the TTP, as various factions vied for control of the group. This infighting weakened the TTP and resulted in a decline in its ability to carry out attacks. However, the group has since reorganized and remains a significant threat to the stability of Pakistan.</p><p>Baitullah Mehsud's legacy remains a controversial one, as some see him as a hero and a freedom fighter, while others view him as a dangerous and brutal terrorist. His life and death are a reminder of the complex and evolving nature of the conflict in Pakistan, and the challenges of combating militant groups that operate across borders and have deep roots within local communities.</p><p></p><p>

In 2004, he was killed in a shootout with Pakistani security forces in Nawabshah. His death was considered a major blow to the militant network in Pakistan at the time.</p><p>After completing his education, Amjad Farooqi joined the militant organization Harkat-ul-Ansar, which later changed its name to Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. He also spent some time fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan before returning to Pakistan. Farooqi was believed to have been involved in the planning and execution of several high-profile attacks in Pakistan, including the assassination attempts on former President Pervez Musharraf and former Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz.</p><p>Farooqi remained a most-wanted fugitive for several years, with a $10 million reward for information leading to his capture. He was finally located in Nawabshah in 2004, where he engaged in a firefight with the Pakistani security forces and was killed. His death was seen as a significant victory in the fight against terrorism in Pakistan at the time.</p><p>Despite his controversial past, Amjad Farooqi remains a significant figure in Pakistan's militant history, and his actions continue to shape the country's security policies to this day.</p><p>Farooqi was born in the village of Rukanpur in Pakistan's Punjab province, in a family with a history of supporting religious and militant organizations.

His ability to work with different organizations was key in his rise to notoriety within the militant network in Pakistan. Farooqi's actions were also driven by his extremist ideology and a desire to rid Pakistan of what he saw as corrupt and decadent influences from the West. His upbringing in a family with a history of supporting radical ideologies likely contributed to his beliefs as well. Despite his controversial background, Farooqi's life and actions continue to be studied by policymakers and analysts seeking to understand the roots of extremism in Pakistan and around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1979		Bannu-November 1, 2013			Dande Darpa Khel)


was
a Pakistani
spokesperson.


					</p><p>Hakimullah Mehsud was not just a spokesperson, he was actually the leader of the Taliban in Pakistan. He was born in Bannu, a city in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, on April 5, 1979. He became the leader of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in 2009, after the death of his predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud.</p><p>During his leadership, the TTP launched a number of attacks against Pakistani military and civilian targets, as well as against foreign forces in neighboring Afghanistan. Mehsud was considered a high-value target by the Pakistani government and the United States for his role in orchestrating these attacks.</p><p>Mehsud was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Dande Darpa Khel, a village in North Waziristan, on November 1, 2013. The strike took place just one day before he was due to participate in peace talks with the Pakistani government. His death was seen as a major blow to the TTP, but the group continued to carry out attacks in the years that followed.</p><p>Hakimullah Mehsud is known for his strong anti-American stance and his involvement in promoting Taliban ideology in Pakistan. He was also accused of having links to Al-Qaeda and other extremist groups, and was designated as a terrorist by the U.S. government. However, he had a strong following among the Pakistani Taliban and was seen as a charismatic leader by his supporters.</p><p>Mehsud was born into a large family in Bannu, and was one of 13 siblings. He received his early education at a local madrasa, or religious school, and later joined the Taliban movement. Mehsud quickly rose through the ranks of the TTP, and became a leading figure in the insurgency against the Pakistani government and the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan.</p><p>Despite his violent tactics and extremist views, some analysts have suggested that Mehsud may have been willing to negotiate a peace settlement with the Pakistani government prior to his death. However, his killing has been seen as a setback to efforts to end the conflict between the TTP and the Pakistani state.</p><p>Mehsud left behind a complex legacy, with some hailing him as a hero of the Taliban movement, and others condemning him as a ruthless terrorist. His death has been seen as both a victory for the U.S. and a blow to the prospects for peace in Pakistan.</p><p>Hakimullah Mehsud was married and had several children. His younger brother, Hafiz Gul Bahadur, was a prominent Taliban leader in North Waziristan. Mehsud was known for his distinctive appearance, with a bushy beard and a round face. He was also known for his fiery speeches, which were often broadcast on Pakistani television.</p><p>Mehsud's death was subject to controversy, with some accusing the U.S. of violating Pakistan's sovereignty by carrying out the drone strike. The incident also drew attention to the highly controversial use of drone strikes in the fight against terrorism.</p><p>In the years following Mehsud's death, the TTP has experienced significant upheaval, with several different leaders taking control of the group. However, the TTP has continued to pose a significant threat to Pakistan and the wider region, with attacks on civilians and security forces remaining a regular occurrence.</p><p>Despite his violent legacy, Mehsud remains a highly influential figure in the world of Islamist extremism, and his impact on the trajectory of militant groups in Pakistan and beyond continues to be felt to this day.</p><p>Despite his death, the legacy of Hakimullah Mehsud continues to reverberate throughout the region. In the years following his demise, the TTP has fragmented and splintered into smaller factions, but the group remains a potent force in Pakistan and the wider region. Some experts believe that the TTP has become even more ideologically extreme in the wake of Mehsud's death, and that the group's newer leaders have proved even more ruthless than their predecessor.</p><p>Mehsud's death also contributed to the ongoing controversy around the use of drone strikes in the fight against extremism. Critics argue that such strikes violate international law and sovereignty, and that they often result in the deaths of innocent civilians. However, defenders of the tactic point to its effectiveness in disrupting extremist networks and eliminating high-value targets like Mehsud.</p><p>Today, Hakimullah Mehsud is remembered as a controversial and divisive figure, a man whose uncompromising commitment to militancy and extremist ideology made him a key player in the ongoing conflict in Pakistan and the wider region. Whether Mehsud will be remembered as a martyr or a terrorist remains a subject of heated debate among experts, but his impact on the world of Islamist extremism is undeniable.</p><p>Hakimullah Mehsud's death in the airstrike left a large leadership void for the TTP, leading to internal power struggles and infighting. The TTP splintered into smaller factions, each with its own leader, making it difficult for the Pakistani government to negotiate with the group. Mehsud's death also strained relations between the U.S. and Pakistan, with many in Pakistan criticizing the U.S. for violating their sovereignty.</p><p>Mehsud's legacy continues to influence Islamist extremism not only in Pakistan but also in the wider region. His uncompromising ideology and violent tactics inspired many jihadists to continue the fight against the Pakistani government and its allies. Mehsud's anti-American stance also resonated with many Islamists around the world, making him a symbol of resistance against American imperialism.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Mehsud remains a significant figure in the world of Islamist extremism. His impact on the TTP and other militant groups in Pakistan and the region is still felt today, and his death highlights the challenges of fighting terrorism with drone strikes and military force. The question of how to deal with extremist groups like the TTP and their leaders continues to be a major challenge for governments around the world.</p><p></p><p>
