(February 28, 1869		Neustrelitz-August 30, 1939			Lugano)


was
a Bolivian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a military officer and played a significant role in the Bolivian army during the Chaco War, which was fought between Bolivia and Paraguay from 1932 to 1935. Kundt was appointed by the Bolivian government to serve as the head of the army and was responsible for leading Bolivian troops in several key battles. However, Kundt was ultimately unable to defeat Paraguayan forces and was forced to resign his post in 1934. After the war, Kundt fled Bolivia and eventually settled in Switzerland where he died in 1939. Kundt remains a controversial figure in Bolivian history and his legacy continues to be debated by scholars and historians.</p><p>Hans Kundt was born in Neustrelitz, Germany to a Prussian army officer. He moved to Bolivia in 1897 and became a naturalized citizen four years later. Kundt had a distinguished military career, fighting in the Chinchasuyo campaign and the Acre War. He became known as one of Bolivia's most capable military figures and was appointed head of the army in 1921.</p><p>During the Chaco War, Kundt initially led the Bolivian army to several victories, but was later defeated by the Paraguayan army in the Battle of Ca√±ada Strongest in 1933. He was blamed for the defeat and forced to resign as commander-in-chief. Kundt was later accused of mishandling the war effort, particularly by neglecting to reinforce key positions and leaving his troops ill-equipped and without adequate support.</p><p>Kundt's controversial legacy also includes allegations of involvement in the 1930 bloody suppression of a miners' uprising, the massacre of the indigenous Bolivian peasantry in 1927 and his close association with and support of conservative and right-wing groups in Bolivia.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his military career and his role in the Chaco War, Kundt is also remembered as an effective military administrator who oversaw important reforms and modernization of the Bolivian armed forces in the 1920s. His efforts to professionalize and modernize the Bolivian military were instrumental in preparing the army for the Chaco War.</p><p>In addition to his military career, Kundt was also a writer and journalist who published several books, including an account of his experiences in Bolivia called "Bolivia: La Gran Aventura". He was also a political figure, serving as a senator and holding other political positions in Bolivia throughout his career. Kundt's legacy remains a subject of debate and study in Bolivia and beyond, with some celebrating his contributions to the Bolivian military and others condemning his controversial actions and associations.</p><p></p><p>
