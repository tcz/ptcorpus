Oppert published several books on Indian history and religion, and regularly traveled to the Indian subcontinent to conduct research. He also served as a member of the Reichstag, the German parliament, from 1881 to 1884. Despite facing criticism for his advocacy of Indian culture, Oppert continued to push for increased study and appreciation of the subcontinent throughout his life.</p><p>Oppert was born in Hamburg, Germany, and initially studied theology and philosophy at the University of Bonn. However, his fascination with ancient Indian culture led him to shift his focus towards Indology.

Grotewohl served as the first Prime Minister of East Germany from 1949 until his death in 1964. During his time in office, he oversaw the establishment of a socialist economy and society in East Germany, as well as the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961. Despite his role as a high-ranking official in the SED government, Grotewohl has been regarded by some historians as a relatively moderate and pragmatic figure who sought to balance the demands of the Soviet Union with the needs of the East German population.</p><p>Grotewohl began his political career as a trade unionist and soon became involved in the German Communist Party. He was arrested in 1933 after Hitler came to power and spent several years in concentration camps. After the war, Grotewohl played a key role in the establishment of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and the unification of the Communist and Socialist parties. As Prime Minister, he implemented policies aimed at developing heavy industry and collectivizing agriculture, but also sought to improve living standards for ordinary East Germans. He was a firm believer in the idea of German reunification, but also saw the GDR as a viable alternative to capitalist West Germany. Despite his vision of a socialist German state, Grotewohl faced criticism for his government's human rights abuses and suppression of political opposition. Nonetheless, he remained a popular figure and was mourned by many East Germans after his untimely death in 1964.</p><p></p><p>

writer and journalist.


					</p><p>He was one of the pioneers of the homosexual rights movement in Germany, founding the Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (Community of the Self-Owned) in 1903, which advocated for the decriminalization of homosexuality and the affirmation of same-sex relationships. Brand's activism was to a large extent influenced by his own sexuality and he was drawn towards engaging in provocative acts of protest against society's repression of homosexuality. In 1907, he was imprisoned for publishing a journal that contained homoerotic literature and was forced to flee to Switzerland in 1933 when the Nazis came to power. Despite the personal persecution he faced, Brand continued to be a vocal proponent of homosexual rights throughout his life, publishing numerous essays and articles on the topic until his death in 1945.</p><p>Brand also had connections to several influential figures in the early 20th century gay rights movement, including Magnus Hirschfeld and Benedict Friedlaender. He was also a member of the German Society for Ethical Culture, which supported sexual and gender diversity. However, Brand's unapologetic stance on homosexuality and his penchant for scandalous acts sometimes put him at odds with other members of the movement. Later in life, Brand struggled financially and lived in poverty. Despite the challenges he faced, his legacy as a trailblazer for LGBTQ+ rights in Germany continues to inspire activists to this day.</p><p></p><p>
