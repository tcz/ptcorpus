					</p><p>Jezzar Pasha was a prominent Ottoman military commander and governor of Sidon and later Acre in Palestine. He is credited with modernizing the cities under his rule and strengthening their defense systems against invaders. He also played a key role in the suppression of the 1804 uprising in Syria and the defense of Acre against Napoleon's forces in 1799. Jezzar Pasha was known for his brutality towards his enemies and was feared by many. Despite this reputation, he was also respected for his effective leadership and management of his territories.</p><p>Jezzar Pasha was born in Stolac, a town in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1720. He began his military career as a soldier in the Ottoman army and gradually rose through the ranks. After serving in various campaigns, he was appointed as the governor of Sidon in 1776, where he began his efforts to modernize the city by building infrastructure and improving sanitation.</p><p>Under his leadership, Sidon became one of the most prosperous cities in the region. He later became the governor of Acre, where he continued his modernization efforts and implemented strict measures to maintain law and order. He also built a strong navy to protect the city from foreign threats.</p><p>During his tenure as governor, Jezzar Pasha faced several rebellions and uprisings, but he was able to crush them with his military prowess and tactical strategies. His most famous victory was the defense of Acre against Napoleon's forces in 1799, which was later commemorated in a painting by Antoine-Jean Gros.</p><p>Despite his reputation as a brutal ruler, Jezzar Pasha was also known for his philanthropy and charity work. He established schools, hospitals, and orphanages to serve the people under his rule. In addition, he was a patron of the arts and supported local artists and musicians.</p><p>Jezzar Pasha died in Acre in 1804, marking the end of an era of Ottoman rule in the region. He left behind a legacy as a military commander, governor, and leader who modernized and defended the cities under his rule, albeit with a heavy hand.</p><p>Jezzar Pasha was of Bosnian descent and was originally named Ahmed. He earned the nickname "Jezzar" (which means butcher in Turkish) due to his reputation for being ruthless towards his enemies. However, it is worth noting that he was also known for his loyalty to the Ottoman Empire and his commitment to protecting his territories from foreign invaders.</p><p>In addition to his military campaigns and modernization efforts, Jezzar Pasha was also known for his personal eccentricities. He was said to have an obsession with cleanliness and was known to wash his hands frequently, even during meetings or meals. He also had a love for exotic animals and kept a private zoo within the grounds of his palace.</p><p>Jezzar Pasha's legacy has been the subject of debate among historians, with some arguing that his brutal tactics were necessary for maintaining order and stability in the region, while others condemn his actions as unjust and oppressive. Nevertheless, his impact on the cities of Sidon and Acre is undeniable, and his rule played a significant role in shaping the history of Palestine and the wider Middle East.</p><p></p><p>
