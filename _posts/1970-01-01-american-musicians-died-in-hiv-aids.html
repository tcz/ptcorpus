(November 17, 1925		Winnetka-October 2, 1985			Beverly Hills)

	
		also known as Leroy Harold Scherer, Jr., Hudson, Leroy, Mr Beefcake, Roy Harold Scherer, Jr., Rock Pyle, Roy Harold Scherer Jr., Roy Harold Fitzgerald, Fitz, Roy or Roc Hudson

	
was
an American
actor.


					</p><p>He was one of the most popular and enduring leading men in Hollywood during the 1950s and 1960s. Hudson appeared in over 70 films and TV shows, including "Giant," "Pillow Talk," and "McMillan & Wife." He was widely regarded as a heartthrob and sex symbol, particularly among female audiences. </p><p>In addition to his successful acting career, Hudson was also known for his philanthropy and activism. He worked with various organizations and charities to help raise awareness and funds for causes such as AIDS research and the fight against cancer. </p><p>Sadly, Hudson died from complications related to AIDS in 1985 at the age of 59. His death helped to raise awareness of the disease and led to a greater public understanding and acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. Hudson's legacy continues to live on as one of Hollywood's greatest leading men and as a trailblazer for LGBTQ+ representation in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Hudson's rise to fame began in the mid-1950s when he signed a contract with Universal Pictures. He quickly became one of their biggest stars and appeared in a series of successful films, including "Magnificent Obsession" and "All That Heaven Allows." However, it was his role in the epic drama "Giant," opposite Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean, that solidified his status as a leading man.</p><p>Despite his success on the silver screen, Hudson was famously private about his personal life. It wasn't until 1985, just months before his death, that he publicly confirmed rumors that he was battling AIDS. His disclosure had a significant impact on public perception of the disease, which had previously been stigmatized and misunderstood.</p><p>In addition to his philanthropic work, Hudson was also an accomplished golfer and owned several golf courses. He was known for his easygoing nature and was beloved by his peers in Hollywood. Following his death, many of his close friends and colleagues spoke out about his kindness and generosity.</p><p>Today, Hudson is remembered as a Hollywood icon and a trailblazer for LGBTQ+ rights. In 2019, he was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>Hudson's legacy also includes his impact on the fashion industry. He was known for his impeccable style and was often seen wearing tailored suits and elegant clothing. His fashion sense helped to popularize the "preppy" look, which became a trend in the 1950s and 1960s. Hudson's influence on men's fashion can still be seen today, as his classic and timeless style continues to be emulated.</p><p>Although he kept his personal life private, Hudson was widely known to be gay among those close to him. At the time, homosexuality was not widely accepted in American society, and many LGBTQ+ individuals faced discrimination and persecution. Hudson's decision to publicly acknowledge his battle with AIDS helped to raise awareness of the disease and reduce some of the stigma surrounding homosexuality.</p><p>Hudson's contribution to the fight against AIDS and his support for the LGBTQ+ community continues to be celebrated. In 1985, his close friend and actress Elizabeth Taylor helped to establish the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) in his memory. The organization remains a leading global nonprofit dedicated to finding a cure for AIDS.</p><p>In recent years, there have been renewed efforts to honor Hudson's legacy and further recognize his contributions. His life and career have been the subject of several documentary films, including "Rock Hudson: Dark and Handsome Stranger" and "Rock Hudson: The Last Giant." These films explore his impact on Hollywood, the fashion industry, and the LGBTQ+ community, and serve as a testament to his enduring influence.</p><p></p><p>

an American
writer, artist, visual artist, performer, filmmaker, photographer and painter.

In 2018, a retrospective of his art was held at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.</p><p>Wojnarowicz had a difficult upbringing, with a history of abuse and running away from home, which strongly influenced his art.

He often used his own body as a canvas, creating self-portraits that were raw and emotional. In his final years, Wojnarowicz became increasingly political, using his art to criticize the government's response to the AIDS epidemic and to advocate for the rights of marginalized communities. He was a vocal opponent of censorship and fought against attempts to silence his work and the work of other artists. Wojnarowicz passed away from AIDS-related complications in 1992 at the age of 37, leaving behind a body of work that continues to inspire and challenge viewers today. His life and work have been the subject of numerous documentaries and books, including Cynthia Carr's biography "Fire in the Belly: The Life and Times of David Wojnarowicz".</p><p></p><p>
