		a.k.a. Dorothy Ruth Hoogstraten, Dorothy or Dorothy R. Stratten

	
was
a Canadian
actor and model.


					</p><p>Stratten began her career as a teenager working at a Dairy Queen in Vancouver before being discovered by a local photographer. She soon began modeling and winning beauty pageants, including being named Playboy's Miss August 1979. Her success ultimately led her to Hollywood, where she had small roles in films and TV shows, including Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. </p><p>However, her life was cut tragically short at the age of 20 when her estranged husband, Paul Snider, shot and killed her before taking his own life. The murder-suicide shocked the entertainment industry and prompted discussion about the systemic exploitation of young women in the entertainment industry. Stratten's story has been told in various books, films, and TV shows, including the critically acclaimed 1983 film Star 80.</p><p>Stratten's death led to a number of changes in Hollywood, including the creation of the nonprofit organization Women in Film, which aims to promote equal opportunities for women in the entertainment industry. Her legacy also includes the Dorothy Stratten Scholarship, which is awarded annually to a Canadian student pursuing a degree in film, television, or theater. Despite her tragic end, Stratten is remembered for her natural beauty, charm, and talent, and is still celebrated as an icon of 1980s pop culture. In 1984, she was posthumously awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>In addition to her career in modeling and acting, Stratten was also pursuing a career in film production through her own company, Xaviera Productions. She had completed a few projects before her death, including a documentary on the Playboy Mansion. Stratten was also known for her charitable work, volunteering for organizations like the Muscular Dystrophy Association and working with the Los Angeles Mission to feed the homeless. Despite her short life, Stratten's impact on the entertainment industry and Canadian culture is still felt today. She is often remembered as a symbol of innocence lost and the dangers of exploitation in show business.</p><p>Stratten's death also resulted in new legislation for the State of California, known as the "Dorothy Stratten Law", which forbids the distribution of nude photos or films of a murder victim for profit. Her life story was adapted into a musical in 1994 called "The Seven Year Itch: The Musical", which chronicled her rise to fame and her tragic end. Stratten's family and friends have continued to keep her memory alive, with her mother and sister working tirelessly to keep her story in the public eye and to raise awareness about domestic violence. Her mother, Nelly Furtado, has also written a book about Stratten's life called "The Complete Dorothy Stratten". Stratten's legacy as a talented actress and model, as well as her impact on the entertainment industry and Canadian culture, continue to be remembered and celebrated to this day.</p><p></p><p>
