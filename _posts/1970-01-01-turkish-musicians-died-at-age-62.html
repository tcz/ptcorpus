(April 5, 1899		Koçarlı-September 17, 1961			İmralı)


was
a Turkish
politician.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Aydın Menderes.

						</p><p>Adnan Menderes was a prominent Turkish politician who served as the Prime Minister of Turkey for three terms, from 1950 until his overthrow in 1960. He was a founding member of the Democrat Party, which ended the one-party rule of the Republican People's Party in Turkey. Menderes was instrumental in implementing significant economic, political, and social reforms that laid the foundation for modern Turkey. However, his government was also marred by allegations of corruption and authoritarianism.</p><p>Menderes was born in a small village in western Turkey and studied law at Istanbul University. He began his political career in the 1930s as a member of the opposition People's Party, which was later reorganized as the Democrat Party. In 1950, the Democrat Party won a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections, and Menderes became the Prime Minister of Turkey.</p><p>During his tenure as Prime Minister, Menderes introduced a series of progressive reforms, including land reforms, agricultural subsidies, and the expansion of public education. He also worked towards liberalizing the Turkish economy, encouraging foreign investment, and improving relations with the West. However, his government was also criticized for its suppression of political dissent and the media.</p><p>In 1960, Menderes was overthrown in a military coup led by General Cemal Gürsel, and was subsequently arrested and charged with violating the constitution. After a controversial trial, Menderes and two of his ministers were sentenced to death and hanged on İmralı island, sparking nationwide protests and condemnation from the international community. Menderes remains a controversial figure in modern Turkish history, and his legacy is still debated.</p><p>Menderes' tenure as Prime Minister also saw significant improvements to Turkey's infrastructure and transportation systems, including building new airports, highways, and railway lines. He also pursued a policy of neutrality in Cold War politics, maintaining good relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union. Despite his controversial downfall, Menderes is still widely regarded as an important figure in Turkey's history, and his economic and social policies laid the groundwork for the country's rapid modernization in the decades that followed. In 1990, his death sentence was posthumously overturned by the Turkish government, and he was officially exonerated of all charges in 2009. Today, many streets, schools, and public buildings in Turkey are named after Adnan Menderes in honor of his contributions to the country's development.</p><p>Menderes was not only a political leader but a charismatic public speaker and an accomplished writer, having authored several books on political theory and philosophy. He was fluent in English and French, which allowed him to effectively communicate with foreign leaders and diplomats. Before entering politics, Menderes worked as a lawyer and journalist, and was involved in the establishment of the Turkish Bar Association. He was also a staunch supporter of Turkey's secular democratic principles, but his government was accused of promoting Islamic fundamentalism and suppressing the country's sizable minority populations, particularly the Kurds. Despite these criticisms, Menderes' legacy as a transformative figure in Turkish politics and society is widely recognized, and his role in shaping modern Turkey is still celebrated by many in the country.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of hanging.
