He also worked on the special effects for films such as The Lost World (1925), Mighty Joe Young (1949), and The War of the Worlds (1953). Despite his significant contributions to the film industry, Delgado remained humble and often downplayed his own achievements.</p><p>Delgado was born in Mexico City and developed an early interest in drawing and art. He pursued studies in architecture before landing a job at the Teatro de la Ciudad, where he designed sets and costumes for theatrical productions. Delgado eventually moved to Hollywood in the 1920s to work in the burgeoning film industry. </p><p>It was his friendship with Willis O'Brien that paved the way for Delgado's career as a special effects artist. O'Brien hired him to help create the spectacular prehistoric creatures in the silent film, The Lost World. Delgado's attention to detail and his ability to sculpt and mold models for stop-motion animation quickly established him as an indispensable member of O'Brien's special effects team. </p><p>Delgado's work on King Kong solidified his reputation as a master of his craft. He designed and built the 18-inch models of the giant gorilla used in the film and worked closely with O'Brien to create the illusion of size and scale in the infamous scenes where King Kong battles airplanes atop the Empire State Building. </p><p>After King Kong's success, Delgado continued his work on various films, including Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd (1952) and The Ten Commandments (1956), for which he created the eerie green apparition that represents the Angel of Death. </p><p>Delgado retired in the early 1960s, but his legacy lives on. His innovative techniques and pioneering work in the field of special effects continue to influence filmmakers today. The Marcel Delgado Award was established in his honor by the Visual Effects Society to recognize excellence in the art of creature and character design in film and television.</p><p></p><p>
