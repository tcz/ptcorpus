His granddaughter, Patience Strong, rose to fame as a poet and writer during the mid-20th century. </p><p>Overall, McNab's life and work offer a glimpse into the intellectual and cultural life of colonial New Zealand, and his contributions to history, genealogy, and environmental conservation continue to influence the country to this day.</p><p>In addition to his military and genealogical pursuits, McNab was also a prolific writer of fiction, penning numerous novels and short stories set in New Zealand. His works often dealt with themes of adventure, romance, and exploration, and he was praised for his vivid depictions of the country's landscapes and people.
