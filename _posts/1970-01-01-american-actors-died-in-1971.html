							Born into a Jewish family, Joe E. Lewis began his entertainment career as a singer in speakeasies during the Prohibition era of the 1920s. He later transitioned into stand-up comedy, and became known for his quick wit and one-liners. Lewis became a popular performer, and made appearances on radio and in films throughout the 1930s and 1940s.</p><p>Despite his success, Lewis was notoriously difficult to work with, and had a reputation for being a heavy drinker. In 1927, he was attacked and left for dead by members of the Chicago mob, which resulted in the partial loss of his throat and vocal cords. He temporarily retired from show business, but eventually returned to performing with a slightly altered singing style.</p><p>In his later years, Lewis wrote a book about his life entitled "The Joker is Wild", which was later adapted into a biographical film starring Frank Sinatra. He died in 1971 at the age of 69 in New York City.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=7790430" title="Wikipedia article about Joe E. Lewis">Joe E.
