was
a Dutch
personality.


					</p><p>He was a lawyer, poet, and a key figure in the Dutch Renaissance. Johannes Secundus served as a secretary to Philip of Hesse and became known for his controversial literature, including his most famous work, "Basia" or "Kisses." The collection of poems, published in 1541, details the physical and emotional intensity of a romantic relationship between a man and a woman. Despite its explicit content, "Basia" became widely popular in Europe and is considered to be one of the earliest examples of erotic literature in modern Europe. Johannes Secundus also wrote philosophical works, such as "De Polluitione Oris" or "On the Pollution of the Mouth," which discussed the effects of harmful language. He died young at the age of 24, leaving behind a legacy of controversial and innovative literature.</p><p>Johannes Secundus was born Jan Everaerts in The Hague, Netherlands. His father, also named Jan Everaerts, was a lawyer and politician. After completing his early education, Secundus attended the University of Bologna in Italy, where he studied law. He later worked as a secretary for the German prince Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse. While in Germany, Secundus became friends with several prominent humanist scholars, including Erasmus of Rotterdam.</p><p>Although Secundus wrote several works in Latin, "Basia" is his most famous and controversial work. The collection of love poems is written in elegiac couplets and explores themes of desire, seduction, and physical pleasure. While the work was popular in Secundus's time, it was also criticized for its explicit content.</p><p>In addition to his poetry, Secundus also wrote a number of philosophical works. "De Polluitione Oris" discusses the importance of using language responsibly and the negative effects of speaking without thought. He also wrote a commentary on work by the Roman poet Ovid.</p><p>Secundus's life was cut short by illness, and he died in his mid-twenties. Despite his short career, he is remembered as one of the most important poets of the Dutch Renaissance. His work, especially "Basia," continues to be studied and enjoyed by scholars and enthusiasts of literature today.</p><p>In addition to his literary and philosophical pursuits, Johannes Secundus was also involved in politics. He was a supporter of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and corresponded with him on several occasions. Secundus also served as an advisor to the governor of Holland and Zealand.</p><p>Secundus's impact on literature was significant. His works, especially "Basia," were an important influence on the development of the erotic literature genre. His poems explore themes of passion, love, and the human body in a way that was groundbreaking for his time. His writing style was also innovative, using classical forms and Latin meter in new and exciting ways.</p><p>Today, Johannes Secundus is remembered as one of the most important poets of the Dutch Renaissance. His work continues to be studied and enjoyed by scholars and literature enthusiasts around the world. His contribution to the development of literature, especially in the area of erotic literature, remains significant.</p><p>Additionally, some historians believe that Johannes Secundus may have been bisexual or homosexual. This speculation is based on the homoerotic undertones in some of his poetry, as well as his close friendships with several young men. Regardless of his sexual orientation, Secundus's work challenged traditional notions of love, desire, and sexuality, paving the way for future writers to explore these themes in their own work. Finally, in his hometown of The Hague, a street is named after him, called Johannes Secundusstraat, in honor of his legacy as a prominent Dutch Renaissance figure.</p><p></p><p>
