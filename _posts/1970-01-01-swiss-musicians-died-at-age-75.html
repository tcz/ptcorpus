		a.k.a. Griselidis Real

	
was
a Swiss
writer.


					</p><p>She was a writer, artist, and prostitute who used her own experiences to write candidly about sex work and the realities of prostitution. She was often considered a feminist icon for her open and unapologetic approach to discussing sexuality and the role of women in society. Her most famous work, "Nights at the Circus," was highly praised for its frank portrayal of the sex industry and the complexities of female identity. Real was also a vocal advocate for sex workers' rights and worked tirelessly to improve conditions for those working in the industry. Despite facing criticism and censorship throughout her career, she continued to write and speak out on behalf of herself and others until her death in 2005.</p><p>In addition to her writing, Grisélidis Réal was also a talented artist and created many works of visual art throughout her life. She began her career as a painter before turning to writing, and her art often explored themes similar to those in her writing: sexuality, gender, and societal norms. She also collaborated with other artists, including French writer and filmmaker Chris Marker, on several multimedia projects that combined visual art and storytelling.</p><p>Real's advocacy work included campaigning for the decriminalization of prostitution, arguing that it was a necessary and legitimate form of work that should be protected by law. She believed that sex workers deserved the same legal and social protections as other workers and that criminalizing prostitution only made it more dangerous for those involved. She founded the Association for the Support of Women in Prostitution, an organization that provided support and resources for women working in the sex industry.</p><p>Real's unabashed honesty about her own experiences and her willingness to challenge societal norms made her a controversial figure during her lifetime. Nevertheless, her influence on the feminist movement and her legacy as a writer and artist continue to be celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>
