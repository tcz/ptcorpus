(April 1, 1794		London-October 16, 1845)


was
an English
architect.


					</p><p>Basevi was born to a wealthy family and received a private education before studying architecture in the office of Sir John Soane. He later traveled to Italy where he studied classical architecture, which inspired his designs. Basevi's most well-known works include the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge and the Church of St. Thomas in Stockport. He also played a significant role in the construction of the Houses of Parliament in London. Despite his success as an architect, Basevi struggled financially throughout his career and often worked on projects for little pay. His accidental death occurred while he was inspecting the roof of Ely Cathedral.</p><p>In addition to his architectural achievements, George Basevi was an accomplished artist, sketching and painting landscapes and buildings throughout his career. He also had a passion for music, playing the piano and the violin. Basevi was a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects and was highly respected within the architectural community. He was known for his attention to detail and his ability to incorporate classical elements into his designs. Despite his financial struggles, Basevi remained dedicated to his work and completed many significant projects throughout his career. His legacy continues to be celebrated in the world of architecture, and his work serves as an inspiration to aspiring architects around the world.</p><p>Basevi's work in the Houses of Parliament was not without controversy. He was responsible for designing the clock tower, which later became known as the Big Ben. However, his design was criticized for being too plain and lacking in elaborate sculpture. Basevi's original design was eventually modified by architect Charles Barry, who added the decorative elements that the tower is now famous for.</p><p>In addition to his architectural and artistic pursuits, Basevi also had a passion for travel. He made several trips to Italy throughout his career, where he studied classical architecture and sketched various buildings and landscapes. His sketches and drawings are now held in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.</p><p>Despite his relatively short career, George Basevi's contributions to architecture helped shape the landscape of 19th-century England. He was a pioneer of the classical revival style, which blended traditional elements of Greek and Roman architecture with modern design principles. Today, his legacy continues to inspire architects and artists around the world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of accidental fall.
