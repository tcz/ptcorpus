					</p><p>Marion Scott was an English musicologist, music critic, and composer. She was primarily known for her work in discovering and promoting the music of French composer Erik Satie. Scott published the first biography of Satie in 1913 and later collaborated with him on various projects. </p><p>Scott was also a talented composer herself, although her works were not as well known as her musicological pursuits. She studied under some of the finest composers of her time, including Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams. </p><p>Throughout her career, Scott contributed to several music-related publications, including The Musical Times and The Observer. She also wrote a book on English songwriters and poets entitled "The Flower of the Mind." </p><p>In addition to her musical accomplishments, Scott was also an advocate for women's suffrage and founded the Society of Women Musicians in 1911 to promote the work of female composers. She continued to work tirelessly to help pave the way for future generations of female musicians until her death in 1953.</p><p>In her early years, Marion Scott studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where she received several awards for her compositions. She later became a music critic for The Daily Telegraph, where she wrote about contemporary composers and performers. Scott's interest in Erik Satie began in 1912 when he submitted some of his works for publication to The New Age, a magazine where Scott was an editor. Impressed by his unique style, Scott sought out Satie and began to work on promoting his music to a wider audience. They collaborated on several projects, including the ballet "Mercure," which was choreographed by Satie and featured music composed by both him and Scott. </p><p>Scott was also an advocate for the rights of female composers, and she worked hard to promote their music through the Society of Women Musicians. In addition to hosting concerts featuring the work of female composers, Scott also wrote articles and gave lectures on the subject. She believed that women had a vital place in the world of music and worked tirelessly to ensure that their contributions were recognized. </p><p>Despite her many achievements, Marion Scott's name is not as well-known as some of her contemporaries. However, her contributions to musicology, composition, and women's rights have left a lasting impact on the world of music. Today, she is remembered as a trailblazer who helped pave the way for future generations of female composers and musicians.</p><p>Later in her career, Marion Scott continued her musicological pursuits by studying and writing about the works of British composers. She was a staunch advocate for the music of her contemporaries and often championed their works in her writing. In addition to her music-related work, Scott was also involved in the Women's Social and Political Union, a suffrage organization that fought for women's right to vote. She regularly attended their meetings and rallies, and even played the piano at some of their events. Scott also wrote articles for the organization's publication, Votes for Women, on the subject of music and its role in the suffrage movement. Despite facing criticism and opposition for her activism, Scott remained dedicated to her beliefs and continued to use her platform to advocate for equality. Marion Scott passed away on December 24, 1953, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking work in musicology, composition, and advocacy for women's rights. Today, she is remembered as a pioneering figure whose contributions to music and society continue to inspire and influence.</p><p>In addition to her work in music and activism, Marion Scott was also an accomplished painter. She studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London and even exhibited her paintings at the Royal Academy. Her paintings often depicted landscapes and portraits, and she was known for her use of vivid colors and bold brushstrokes. Scott's artistic pursuits were not well-known during her lifetime, and it is only in recent years that her paintings have garnered more attention. Today, her artworks are held in private collections and galleries around the world. Despite being recognized in her lifetime for her contributions to music and women's rights, Marion Scott's talents as a painter were not fully appreciated until after her death.</p><p></p><p>
