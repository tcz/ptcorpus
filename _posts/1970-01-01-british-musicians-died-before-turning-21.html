a British
personality.


					</p><p>Sidney Keyes was an English poet and soldier. He was born in Dartford, Kent and educated at Bickley Hall School, Repton and finally at Oxford University. In 1941, he joined the British Armed Forces to fight in World War II. During his time in the forces, he served in North Africa, Italy and Greece. He also wrote extensively about his experiences in his poetry. Keyes’ poetry reflected the horrors of war and explored the theme of young men going to fight for their country. Keyes' work was widely acclaimed and he became one of the leading voices of the World War II generation. Tragically, he was killed in action in 1943, aged just 20 years old. Despite his young age and short career, Keyes’ poetry had a profound impact on the literary world and continues to influence contemporary poets today.</p><p>One of Sidney Keyes' most famous works was his collection of poems titled "The Cruel Solstice," published in 1943 shortly before his death. The collection included poems that expressed his disillusionment with war and his struggle to find meaning in it, as well as reflections on his own mortality as a soldier. Keyes was also known for his friendship with fellow poet Keith Douglas, who was also a soldier and died in battle. The two corresponded through poetry and their shared experiences of war, which influenced both of their works. Keyes' legacy as a poet and soldier is celebrated by the Sidney Keyes Memorial Trust, which awards an annual prize for poetry in his honor.</p><p>Additionally, Sidney Keyes was known for his involvement with the romantic poet group called the Apocalyptic poets. He was among the youngest of the group and was often referred to as the "boy poet." Keyes was also an admirer of T.S Eliot and his work was influenced by Eliot's modernist style of poetry. During his time at Oxford University, Keyes was an active member of the university's poetry society and contributed to its magazine, The Isis. Despite his young age, Keyes was known for his maturity and deep understanding of the complexities of war and life, which was evident in his poetry. Today, he is considered one of the most promising poets of his generation, whose life and career were sadly cut short by the war.</p><p></p><p>
