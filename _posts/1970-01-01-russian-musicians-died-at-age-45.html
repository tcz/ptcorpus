(July 13, 1894		Odessa-January 27, 1940			Butyrka prison)

	
		also known as Isaak Babel, I. Babelʹ, Babel or Isaac Babel

	
was
a Russian
writer and journalist.


					</p><p>Babel is best known for his short stories, including "Red Cavalry" and "Odessa Stories". He was born in a Jewish family and grew up in Odessa, where he studied at the local gymnasium. After the Russian Revolution, he became a journalist and joined the Red Army as a correspondent. Babel's experiences during the Polish-Soviet War inspired his most famous work, "Red Cavalry". </p><p>Babel was a controversial figure during his lifetime, and his writing was both praised for its revolutionary style and attacked for its portrayal of violence and sexuality. In 1939, he was arrested during Stalin's Great Purge and charged with counter-revolutionary activities. He was executed in 1940 in the notorious Butyrka prison in Moscow. </p><p>Despite his tragic end, Babel's writing continues to be celebrated today for its innovation and insight into life in the Soviet Union.</p><p>Babel was married twice and had one daughter, Nathalie Babel, who became a translator and scholar of his works. After his arrest, Babel's manuscripts and personal papers were confiscated and never returned to his family. They were later discovered in the archives of the KGB and made public in the 1990s. Babel's writing had a significant influence on other notable writers, such as Ernest Hemingway and Isaac Bashevis Singer. In addition to his short stories, Babel also wrote screenplays and worked on several films. In 1935, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour for his contributions to Soviet literature. Despite his accolades, Babel was ultimately a victim of Stalin's regime and his legacy serves as a reminder of the dangers of totalitarianism and censorship.</p><p>Babel's writing style was groundbreaking and innovative for its time. He often employed fragmented narratives and vivid descriptions of violence and sexuality, which shocked some readers but also captivated others with their raw honesty. His works also explored the themes of identity, power, and the complexities of human relationships. Babel's writing inspired many other Russian writers and his legacy continues to influence modern Russian literature. </p><p>In addition to his writing, Babel was also involved in the film industry. He worked on several films as a screenwriter, including Sergei Eisenstein's "Battleship Potemkin". He also wrote the screenplay for the film "Bezhin Meadow", which was later banned by Soviet authorities for its supposed anti-Soviet message.</p><p>Babel's daughter Nathalie spent much of her life dedicated to preserving and promoting her father's works. She emigrated to the United States in 1951 and worked as a professor of Russian literature at Yale University. She also translated many of her father's works into English and published a memoir about her experiences growing up as his daughter.</p><p>Today, Babel is considered to be one of the most significant writers of the early Soviet era. His works continue to be studied and celebrated around the world, and his life remains a testament to the power of artistic expression in the face of political oppression.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in capital punishment.
