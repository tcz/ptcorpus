(September 29, 1792		Elmina-February 10, 1850			Elmina)


was
a Ghanaian
businessperson and merchant.


					</p><p>He was from a prominent family in Elmina and his father was a successful merchant as well. Carel Hendrik Bartels followed in his father's footsteps and became a prominent merchant on the West Coast of Africa. He mainly traded in gold and slaves, which were common commodities at the time. </p><p>Bartels was known for his business acumen and his ability to negotiate deals with traders from different countries. He established trading partnerships with the British, the Dutch, and the Portuguese, among others. In addition to his business activities, Bartels was also involved in local politics and served as a chief in his hometown of Elmina.</p><p>Bartels was part of a generation of African merchants who were able to use their wealth and influence to challenge the European powers that colonized Africa. Although he profited from the slave trade, he was also a respected figure in his community and used his position to advocate for the rights of enslaved people. </p><p>Bartels died in 1850, and his legacy as a successful businessman and leader in his community is still remembered today.</p><p>Despite his success as a merchant, Carel Hendrik Bartels faced many challenges in his life. He lived in a time when European powers were aggressively expanding their control over African lands and people. Bartels had to navigate the complex and often violent political environment of the region, which was marked by wars and conflicts among different African tribes and with European powers. He was also affected by the abolitionist movement in Europe, which gradually led to the outlawing of the slave trade.</p><p>In response to these challenges, Bartels adapted his business strategies to stay ahead of the competition. He diversified his trade interests and invested in other commodities such as ivory, palm oil, and timber. He also entered into partnerships with other African traders and used his network of contacts to expand his trading routes across the region. However, despite his resourcefulness and success, Bartels was unable to escape the negative impact of colonialism on his people and his environment.</p><p>Today, Carel Hendrik Bartels is remembered as one of the most influential African traders of his time. His legacy as a prominent merchant, local leader, and advocate for the rights of enslaved people continues to inspire new generations of Africans. Moreover, his life story serves as a powerful reminder of the complexities and contradictions of the African experience during the colonial era.</p><p></p><p>
