He often experimented with different techniques and materials, such as solarization, multiple exposures, and photograms, which helped him create surreal and abstract images. His work was seen as a departure from traditional photography, which focused on sharp detail and clarity. Instead, Ver sought to capture the essence of his subject through mood and atmosphere.</p><p>Ver's photographs were also known for their political and social commentary. He documented the effects of poverty and war on ordinary people, and his images often conveyed a sense of empathy and compassion for his subjects. His photographs from the Spanish Civil War, for example, were some of the first to show the human toll of the conflict.</p><p>In addition to his photography and painting, Ver also worked as a filmmaker, producing documentaries and experimental films.
