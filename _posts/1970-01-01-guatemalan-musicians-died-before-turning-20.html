was
a Guatemalan
personality.


					</p><p>Actually, Mariano Paredes (January 7, 1797 - September 7, 1849) was a President of Mexico. Born in Valle de Allende, Chihuahua, he joined the military at a young age and was appointed as President of Mexico on July 4, 1846. His presidency was rather tumultuous, marked by political upheaval and social unrest. He was ousted in 1848 by a popular revolt led by the Mexican liberal faction. Despite his controversial presidency, Paredes remains a significant figure in Mexican history due to his involvement in the Mexican-American War and his attempts to modernize the country's military.</p><p>After being ousted from the presidency, Mariano Paredes went into exile to Cuba, where he spent the rest of his days. He had a military career spanning over three decades and served in various positions within the Mexican Army. Paredes was instrumental in the defeat of Texas during the Texas Revolution and later, in the Mexican-American War, he commanded the Mexican Army's operations in the north. Despite his military successes, his presidency was marred by corruption and authoritarianism, leading to his eventual downfall. Paredes' legacy continues to be debated by historians and political scholars.</p><p></p><p>
