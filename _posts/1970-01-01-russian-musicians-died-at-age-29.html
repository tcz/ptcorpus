		called
		Anna of Russia, Tsarevna Praskovya Ivanovna of Russia and Tsarevna Catherine Ivanovna of Russia.

						</p><p>Ivan V of Russia was the co-ruler of Russia alongside his elder brother, Peter the Great. Despite his position as co-ruler, Ivan V was known to be a weak and ineffectual leader, often overshadowed by his more dynamic brother Peter the Great. Ivan V suffered from several physical and mental disabilities that made him unable to rule effectively.</p><p>During Ivan V's reign, Russia faced a number of challenges, including wars and social unrest. However, Ivan V himself played little role in addressing these issues. Instead, the burden of governing fell largely on Peter the Great, who would go on to become one of Russia's most famous and transformative rulers.</p><p>Despite Ivan V's limited role in Russian politics and history, he remains an important historical figure, as his reign marked the beginning of the rule of the Romanov dynasty in Russia. His children, including Anna of Russia, would go on to play important roles in Russian politics in the years to come.</p><p></p><p>
