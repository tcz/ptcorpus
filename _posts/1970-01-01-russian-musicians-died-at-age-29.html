(August 27, 1666		Moscow-February 8, 1696			Moscow)


was
a Russian
personality.


					
			
		His children
		are
		called
		Anna of Russia, Tsarevna Praskovya Ivanovna of Russia and Tsarevna Catherine Ivanovna of Russia.

						</p><p>Ivan V of Russia was the co-ruler of Russia alongside his elder brother, Peter the Great. Despite his position as co-ruler, Ivan V was known to be a weak and ineffectual leader, often overshadowed by his more dynamic brother Peter the Great. Ivan V suffered from several physical and mental disabilities that made him unable to rule effectively.</p><p>During Ivan V's reign, Russia faced a number of challenges, including wars and social unrest. However, Ivan V himself played little role in addressing these issues. Instead, the burden of governing fell largely on Peter the Great, who would go on to become one of Russia's most famous and transformative rulers.</p><p>Despite Ivan V's limited role in Russian politics and history, he remains an important historical figure, as his reign marked the beginning of the rule of the Romanov dynasty in Russia. His children, including Anna of Russia, would go on to play important roles in Russian politics in the years to come.</p><p>Ivan V was born into the Romanov family, the ruling dynasty of Russia, as the second son of Tsar Alexis. His father died when he was only three years old, and Ivan V and his elder brother Peter were thrust into the role of co-rulers when their half-brother Feodor III died without an heir in 1682.</p><p>Despite his disabilities, Ivan V was initially treated as the senior ruler, with Peter the Great relegated to a secondary role. However, as Peter grew older and began to assert himself, it became clear that he was the more capable of the two brothers, and he gradually assumed more power.</p><p>Ivan V married Princess Praskovia Saltykova in 1684, but the couple had no surviving children. After Ivan V's death in 1696, he was succeeded by his son-in-law, Tsar Peter II, the husband of his daughter Catherine Ivanovna.</p><p>Today, Ivan V is remembered as a minor figure in Russian history, overshadowed by his more famous brother Peter the Great. However, his reign played a significant role in the history of the Romanov dynasty and the development of Russia as a major European power.</p><p></p><p>
