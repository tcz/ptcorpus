						</p><p>George V was the King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India from 1910 until his death in 1936. He was the second son of Prince Albert Edward (later King Edward VII) and Alexandra, Princess of Wales. Prior to his ascension to the throne, George V served in the Royal Navy and was a keen stamp collector. </p><p>During his reign, George V saw the British Empire reach its zenith, with the country being the largest empire in the world. He also played a key role in the country's entry into World War I, leading the British military through the conflict. </p><p>George V was known for his simple and unpretentious personality, which endeared him to the public. He was a family man, and was devastated by the death of his youngest son, Prince John, in 1919.</p><p>In addition to his children, George V was survived by his wife, Queen Mary, whom he had married in 1893. Together, they were the first British monarchs to visit India and established the modern tradition of the Christmas broadcast, now known as the Queen's Speech.</p><p>During his reign, George V oversaw several significant events, including the passing of the Parliament Act in 1911, which limited the power of the House of Lords, as well as the first Labour government in 1924. His coronation in 1911 was the first to be filmed, and he used the new medium of radio to speak to his people. However, his reign was also marked by the Irish War of Independence and the rise of the Labour and suffragette movements.</p><p>George V and his wife were also known for their philanthropic work, particularly for their support of hospitals and service personnel. Queen Mary established the Queen's Nursing Institute, while George V founded the Order of the British Empire to recognize contributions to public service.</p><p>After his death, George V was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward VIII, who abdicated after less than a year on the throne. George V's second son, George VI, then became king, and his daughter, Mary, became a prominent member of the royal family. Today, the legacy of George V can be seen in the continued presence and influence of the British monarchy, as well as in his contributions to the social and political fabric of the United Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>
