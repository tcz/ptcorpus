(August 22, 1965		Winnipeg-May 4, 2004			Ottawa)


was
a Canadian
personality.


					</p><p>David Reimer was born Bruce Peter Reimer and was a victim of a botched circumcision at the age of 8 months in which his penis was destroyed beyond repair. As a result, his parents turned to Dr. John Money, a sex researcher at Johns Hopkins University, who advised them to raise Bruce as a female, Brenda, and undergo genital reconstruction surgery.</p><p>Bruce underwent hormone therapy and surgery to create female genitalia, and was raised as Brenda, but he never identified as female and struggled with depression and feelings of being trapped in the wrong body throughout his childhood and adolescence. Despite the trauma and complications, Dr. Money touted the case as a success story in support of his theory that gender identity was learned rather than innate.</p><p>In his early 20s, Bruce decided to transition back to male and underwent hormone therapy and a double mastectomy to remove the breasts that had developed as a result of the feminizing hormones. He later underwent phalloplasty surgery to construct a penis, but the surgery was also unsuccessful.</p><p>In the years after his transition, David became an advocate for intersex and transgender rights, speaking out against the harm caused by the medicalization of gender and the notion of gender being binary. Tragically, he died by suicide in 2004, leaving behind a wife and twin sons. His story has been the subject of numerous documentaries and studies, and has had a significant impact on the understanding and treatment of intersex and transgender individuals.</p><p>David Reimer’s story is often used to illustrate the complexity of gender identity and how harmful it can be when individuals are forced to conform to societal norms. Despite the traumatic experiences he went through, Reimer remained dedicated to advocating for intersex and transgender rights. He also co-authored a book titled “As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl” which documented his experiences and became a bestseller. David’s legacy continues to inspire efforts to support and protect the rights of intersex and transgender individuals.</p><p>David Reimer’s legacy has had a long-lasting impact on the field of psychology as well. His case was one of the factors that exposed the flaws in Dr. Money’s theory of gender identity, and led to a significant shift in thinking about gender and sexuality. Today, medical professionals view gender identity as a complex and multifaceted aspect of individual identity that is not necessarily tied to biology. David’s case has also raised important ethical questions about the medical treatment of intersex individuals and the role of gender in society. His life and work continue to inspire ongoing efforts to promote gender equity and inclusivity.</p><p></p><p>
