She is perhaps best known for her role in the classic silent film "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" (1920), which is widely regarded as a masterpiece of German expressionist cinema. In addition to acting, Makowska was also a radio personality and a journalist. She left Europe for Brazil during World War II and later settled in Rome, where she spent the rest of her life. Despite her extensive career, Makowska remained a relatively obscure figure until after her death. In recent years, however, there has been renewed interest in her work, with several film festivals and retrospectives featuring her performances.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=22677133" title="Wikipedia article about Helena Makowska">Helena Makowska on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swedish-actors-died-at-age-55.html' title='Swedish actors died at age 55'><strong>Swedish actors died at age 55</strong> List of the top 3 Swedish actors who died when they were 55</a></li><li><a href='/german-actresses-died-in-1982.html' title='German actresses died in 1982'><strong>German actresses died in 1982</strong> List of the top 6 German actresses who died in 1982</a></li><li><a href='/israeli-actresses-died-before-turning-21.html' title='Israeli actresses died before turning 21'><strong>Israeli actresses died before turning 21</strong> List of the top 2 Israeli actresses who died before they turned 21</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/french-actresses-died-in-anorexia-nervosa.html' title='French actresses died in Anorexia nervosa'><strong>French actresses died in Anorexia nervosa</strong> List of the top 1 French actresses who died in Anorexia nervosa</a></li><li><a href='/german-actresses-died-in-1971.html' title='German actresses died in 1971'><strong>German actresses died in 1971</strong> List of the top 6 German actresses who died in 1971</a></li><li><a href='/turkish-actresses-died-in-2014.html' title='Turkish actresses died in 2014'><strong>Turkish actresses died in 2014</strong> List of the top 2 Turkish actresses who died in 2014</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
