She starred in numerous films throughout the 1920s and was often cast as the archetypal "flapper" character. Her comedic timing and charm made her a sought-after actress and she worked with some of the top directors of the time, including Ernst Lubitsch and King Vidor.</p><p>Despite her success, Prevost struggled with personal issues and substance abuse. By the 1930s, her career had declined and she was largely forgotten by Hollywood. She died tragically at the age of 38 from alcohol-related causes. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Prevost and her work, and she is now recognized as one of the notable stars of the silent film era.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=184473" title="Wikipedia article about Marie Prevost">Marie Prevost on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Yvonne De Carlo</h2><p><strong>Yvonne De Carlo</strong>
