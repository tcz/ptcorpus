a Cypriot
writer.


					</p><p>Pallikarides was known for his involvement in the EOKA movement, which aimed to remove the British colonial rule from Cyprus and unite the island with Greece. He was arrested at the age of 19 for his participation in a bombing campaign against the British authorities in Cyprus. He was later convicted and sentenced to death by hanging, despite protests and international appeals for clemency. Pallikarides became a symbol of resistance for many Cypriots and remains a controversial figure in the history of the island. Despite his young age, his legacy has inspired many future generations of activists and writers in Cyprus.</p><p>Aside from his involvement in the EOKA movement, Evagoras Pallikarides was also a talented writer who explored themes of love, politics, and the human condition in his poetry and prose. He was influenced by the works of Greek and Cypriot writers such as Constantinos Cavafy and Kyriakos Charalambides. His literary works were published in various newspapers and literary magazines in Cyprus during the 1950s, and some of his pieces have been compiled into a collection of poems titled "In the Evening Light." Pallikarides was also known for his charisma and leadership qualities within the EOKA movement, which earned him a large following among young Cypriots at the time. Despite his tragic end, Pallikarides remains a revered figure in Cypriot culture and his life and works continue to inspire future generations of Cypriots towards self-determination and independence.</p><p>In the years following his execution, Evagoras Pallikarides became a symbol of defiance and steadfastness against oppression in Cyprus. His death at the hands of the British authorities galvanized the Cypriot people and sparked a wave of protests and demonstrations that eventually led to the island's independence in 1960. Many streets, buildings and public squares in Cyprus have been named after him as a tribute to his legacy. In addition to being a writer and an activist, Pallikarides was also a talented athlete who excelled in wrestling and boxing. He was known for his physical strength and agility and often used his athletic abilities to evade British authorities during his time as a fighter. Despite his short life, Evagoras Pallikarides continues to be remembered as a hero and a martyr in the struggle for Cypriot independence.</p><p>Pallikarides' death by hanging on March 14, 1957, was met with widespread outrage both in Cyprus and internationally. Many human rights organizations and prominent figures, including Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein, called for his release and argued that his execution violated basic principles of justice and human rights. However, their appeals were unsuccessful, and Pallikarides was executed at the age of 19. His death sparked widespread protests and demonstrations in Cyprus, and is considered a turning point in the island's struggle for independence. His legacy continues to inspire many activists and writers in Cyprus, who see him as a powerful symbol of resistance and resilience against oppression. Today, Pallikarides is remembered in Cyprus as a national hero and a powerful voice for Cypriot independence and self-determination.</p><p></p><p>
