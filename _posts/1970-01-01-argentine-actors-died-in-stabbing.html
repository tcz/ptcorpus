						</p><p>He is best known for his influential documentary film "The Hour of the Furnaces," which examined the political and social upheaval in Argentina during the 1960s and 1970s. Cedrón became a prominent figure in the Argentine New Wave movement and was praised for his artistic approach and politically charged storytelling. </p><p>After the 1976 Argentine coup d'état, Cedrón was forced into exile and he settled in Paris, France. Despite being away from his home country, he continued to produce films focused on the political turmoil in Argentina. His films often dealt with themes of memory, social justice and human rights abuses, and they were often censored by the Argentine government. </p><p>Cedrón also worked as a film critic, translator and journalist throughout his career, contributing to various publications in Argentina and France. He died in 1980 in Paris at the age of 38, and is remembered as a pioneer of South American cinema.</p><p>In addition to his documentary film career, Jorge Cedrón also had a prolific career as a fiction filmmaker. He directed several feature films, including "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) and "Ignacio" (1975). Cedrón also collaborated with other Argentine filmmakers, such as Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino on films like "Perón: Actualidad de una Dictadura" (1971) and "Los Hijos de Fierro" (1972).</p><p>During his time in Paris, Cedrón established himself as an important figure in the Latin American cultural scene. He founded the journal "Cinematographos" and worked with the Argentine filmmaker Gerardo Vallejo on several documentary films. Cedrón also continued to participate in human rights activism, working with organizations such as Amnesty International and the International League for Human Rights. </p><p>Today, Cedrón's influence on Argentine and Latin American cinema continues to be felt. His work is often cited as an important example of politically committed filmmaking and has been influential in various movements for social and political change in the region. In 2009, the Argentine National Film Institute established the Jorge Cedrón Award, which recognizes filmmakers who are carrying on Cedrón's legacy of "socially committed cinema."</p><p>Jorge Cedrón's early life was marked by political activism and his involvement with left-wing student groups. He studied philosophy and attended the National University of La Plata before switching to film studies at the National Institute of Cinema. Cedrón's interest in Marxism and revolutionary politics played a significant role in his filmmaking, and he was deeply committed to using art as a means of political resistance. </p><p>One of Cedrón's most significant contributions to Argentine cinema was his documentary film "The Hour of the Furnaces," which was released in 1968. The film was a powerful and searing indictment of the social and political conditions in Argentina, and it made a major impact on the country's cultural scene. "The Hour of the Furnaces" is now considered a seminal work in the history of Latin American cinema.</p><p>In addition to his work as a filmmaker, Cedrón was also an accomplished film critic and journalist. He wrote for both Argentine and French publications, including "La Opinión," "Clarín," and "Les Lettres Nouvelles." His critical writing reflected his political commitments and his interest in advancing leftist political causes.</p><p>After the military junta seized power in Argentina in 1976, Cedrón was forced to flee the country. He settled in Paris, where he continued to work as a filmmaker and activist. Cedrón's films in exile were marked by a sense of longing for his homeland and a deep concern for the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Argentine government. His work in Paris helped cement his legacy as one of the most important voices in Latin American cinema.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/spanish-actresses-died-at-age-45.html' title='Spanish actresses died at age 45'><strong>Spanish actresses died at age 45</strong> List of the top 1 Spanish actresses who died when they were 45</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome.html' title='Famous actors died in Acute respiratory distress syndrome'><strong>Famous actors died in Acute respiratory distress syndrome</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actors who died in Acute respiratory distress syndrome</a></li><li><a href='/bangladeshi-actresses-died-before-turning-20.html' title='Bangladeshi actresses died before turning 20'><strong>Bangladeshi actresses died before turning 20</strong> List of the top 1 Bangladeshi actresses who died before they turned 20</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swedish-actors-died-in-2002.html' title='Swedish actors died in 2002'><strong>Swedish actors died in 2002</strong> List of the top 2 Swedish actors who died in 2002</a></li><li><a href='/malaysian-actresses-died-in-parkinson-s-disease.html' title='Malaysian actresses died in Parkinson's disease'><strong>Malaysian actresses died in Parkinson's disease</strong> List of the top 1 Malaysian actresses who died in Parkinson's disease</a></li><li><a href='/russian-musicians-died-at-age-51.html' title='Russian musicians died at age 51'><strong>Russian musicians died at age 51</strong> List of the top 11 Russian music stars who died when they were 51</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
