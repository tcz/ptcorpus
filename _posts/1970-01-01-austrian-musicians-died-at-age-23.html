									</h1><p>Here are 3 famous musicians from Austria died at 23:</p><h2>Otto Weininger</h2><p><strong>Otto Weininger</strong>
(April 3, 1880		Vienna-October 4, 1903			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
writer and philosopher.


					</p><p>Despite his short life, Weininger is best known for his controversial and influential work "Sex and Character," which explores the ideas of gender and sexuality. The work argues that all humans possess both masculine and feminine traits, and claims that the perceived distinctions between genders are artificial constructs perpetuated by society. Weininger's work was met with both acclaim and criticism, and his ideas continue to be debated by scholars to this day. He was also known for his radical views on Judaism and anti-Semitism, which sparked controversy during his lifetime and contributed to his tragic end.</p><p>Weininger's family was Jewish and he converted to Protestantism at the age of 23. His views on Judaism were complex and controversial. In "Sex and Character," Weininger argued that Jews were a "feminine" race and that their perceived feminine qualities were responsible for anti-Semitic prejudice. He saw Judaism as a religion that encouraged a "feminine" way of thinking and viewed Christianity as a religion that emphasized masculine virtues. These views have been widely criticized as misguided and offensive.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his work, Weininger's ideas had a significant impact on 20th-century thought. His ideas on gender and sexuality were influential for early feminists and helped challenge traditional notions of gender roles. Sigmund Freud was also influenced by Weininger's work, particularly his ideas on the duality of human nature. However, many of Weininger's ideas are now criticized for being essentialist and oversimplified.</p><p>In addition to his philosophical and literary work, Otto Weininger was also known for his academic achievements. He studied mathematics and philosophy at the University of Vienna, where he received his PhD at the young age of 21. Despite his intellectual prowess, Weininger struggled with mental health issues and was hospitalized for depression several times throughout his life. </p><p>Weininger's tragic end came at just 23 years old when he died by suicide in his family's apartment in Vienna. The exact reasons for his suicide are unclear, but it is widely believed that his struggles with mental illness, personal and professional disappointments, and societal rejection of his controversial ideas all contributed to his decision. Despite his short life, Otto Weininger's work continues to influence philosophical and cultural movements to this day.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in suicide.

personality.


					</p><p>Geli Raubal was the half-niece of Adolf Hitler. She lived with him in Munich and was known to have an intimate relationship with him. She was 23 years old when she died under mysterious circumstances, leading to rumors of suicide or murder. Despite the investigation, the case was never solved and continues to be a topic of interest for historians and conspiracy theorists. Her death affected Hitler deeply and some historians believe it may have contributed to his paranoia later in life.</p><p>Geli Raubal had a complex relationship with Hitler, who was more than 19 years older than her. She accompanied him to various events and traveled with him extensively. However, she was also known to have a rebellious streak and was reportedly considering leaving him. Raubal's death occurred in Hitler's Munich apartment, where she was found with a single gunshot wound. Some historians believe that Hitler may have been responsible for her death, while others speculate that it was suicide. There is evidence to suggest that Raubal was unhappy in her relationship with Hitler, and may have suffered from depression or other mental health issues. Despite the ongoing mystery surrounding her death, Raubal has been immortalized in various works of art, including films, novels, and plays.</p><p>Geli Raubal's father, Leo Raubal Sr., was Adolf Hitler's half-brother. Raubal was born in Linz, Austria, and grew up in Vienna. She was known to be a lively and charming individual who enjoyed dancing and socializing.
