teacher, nurse and missionary.

She composed many hymns, including "Lord of the Years" and "Through all the Changing Scenes of Life," which are still sung in churches today. Margaret and her fellow prisoners were eventually sent to a new prison camp on Bangka Island.

Her contributions to the small community of prisoners earned her the nickname "the hymn writer."</p><p>Following her death, Margaret's hymns gained widespread popularity as a symbol of hope and perseverance in the face of adversity. In 1958, "Lord of the Years" was included in the hymnal of the Church of Scotland, solidifying its place in religious music. In 1983, Margaret and the other women and children who were killed on the ship were memorialized in a service at St Paul's Cathedral in London, where her hymns were once again sung in tribute.</p><p>Margaret's life and legacy have been celebrated in various books and publications, and her story continues to inspire people around the world.</p><p></p><p>
