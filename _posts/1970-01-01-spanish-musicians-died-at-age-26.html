(April 5, 2015		Madrid-April 5, 1989)


was
a Spanish
personality.


					</p><p>Federico Coullaut-Valera Mendigutia was a renowned Spanish sculptor and artist, best known for his contributions to art during the Francoist period in Spain. He was born on April 5, 1912, in Madrid, Spain, and spent most of his life in his hometown. Federico Coullaut-Valera Mendigutia lived through many turbulent events in Spanish history, including the Spanish Civil War and the rise of Francisco Franco's dictatorship. Despite these circumstances, Coullaut-Valera Mendigutia developed a unique style characterized by figurative realism and monumentality, which reflected the ideals of the Franco regime. His sculptures can be found across Spain's public squares, including the Generalissimo Franco Monument in Madrid's Plaza de Oriente. Federico Coullaut-Valera Mendigutia remains an important figure in Spanish art history and is recognized for his contributions to the country's cultural heritage. He died on April 5, 1989, on his 77th birthday, leaving behind a legacy of powerful sculptures that continue to be admired and celebrated to this day.</p><p>In addition to his artistic pursuits, Federico Coullaut-Valera Mendigutia was also a respected academic. He studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid and later became a professor at the institution, where he taught for over two decades. During his tenure at the academy, Coullaut-Valera Mendigutia mentored many young artists who would go on to become important figures in the Spanish art world. In recognition of his achievements, Coullaut-Valera Mendigutia was awarded numerous honors throughout his career, including the Gold Medal for Fine Arts by the Spanish government. Today, his works are exhibited in museums and galleries around the world and continue to inspire artists and art enthusiasts alike.</p><p>Despite Coullaut-Valera Mendigutia's association with the Franco regime, his artistic style evolved over time, and his later works showed more experimentation and abstraction, moving away from the rigid formalism of the earlier period. He created sculptures that were more expressive and conveyed emotions that did not conform to the political ideology of the dictatorship. This evolution has made him a more complex figure in Spanish art history, and his works have been reevaluated in recent years, with many seeing him as an artist who navigated the challenges of his time while retaining a unique voice within his art. Coullaut-Valera Mendigutia's sculptures are noted for their meticulous attention to detail, which borders on hyperrealism, and their larger-than-life size, which creates a powerful physical presence. Despite his success as an artist, Coullaut-Valera Mendigutia remained humble and devoted to the art form, stating in one interview, "Sculpture is my life. It's what keeps me going."</p><p></p><p>
