		also known as Logothetis, Anestis

	
was
an Austrian
composer.


						</p><p>Born in Burgas, Bulgaria, to Greek parents, Anestis Logothetis grew up in Greece and later moved to Vienna to study music. He became one of Austria's most important electroacoustic composers, creating works that experimented with sound and technology.</p><p>Logothetis was a pioneer in the field of computer music, using early computers to generate and manipulate sound. He also worked with tape recorders, sound generators, and other devices to create unique and groundbreaking compositions.</p><p>In addition to his work as a composer, Logothetis was also a respected teacher and writer. He taught at the Music Academy in Vienna and at Dartmouth College in the United States. He wrote several books on music theory and composition, as well as articles for various music journals.</p><p>Logothetis continued to compose and experiment with sound until his death in 1994. His legacy as an innovator in electronic and computer music continues to influence contemporary music today.</p><p>Logothetis studied music in Athens, Greece and later in Vienna, Austria. He received his doctorate in musicology from the University of Vienna in 1951. In Vienna, he studied with renowned composers like Anton Webern and Hanns Eisler. Logothetis was also influenced by the works of famous composers like Arnold Schoenberg and Karlheinz Stockhausen.</p><p>His early works were influenced by traditional Greek music, but he later moved towards more experimental and avant-garde styles. His compositions were often characterized by unconventional sounds and structures, and he incorporated elements of chance and improvisation in his works. Some of his notable compositions include "Fantasmata" (1958), "Phobia" (1961), and "Mikrophonie II" (1965).</p><p>In addition to his music, Logothetis was also interested in the relationship between art and technology. He collaborated with visual artists and created several multimedia works that combined music, video, and other electronic media. He also explored the use of video and computer technology in his compositions.</p><p>Logothetis received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the Austrian State Prize for Music in 1979. He was also a member of several prestigious music organizations, including the International Society for Contemporary Music.</p><p>Logothetis was known for pushing the boundaries of traditional music and experimenting with new and innovative techniques. He was particularly interested in the use of randomness and chance in his compositions, which he believed could produce unexpected and creative results. This approach can be seen in his piece "Phobia," which was created by using a set of instructions to produce a completely unpredictable composition.</p><p>Throughout his career, Logothetis remained committed to exploring the connections between music, technology, and society. He believed that music had the power to shape the world and that new forms of technology could help make music more accessible and inclusive. He was especially interested in using computer technology to create music that was more democratic and participatory, allowing people from all backgrounds to engage with and create music.</p><p>Logothetis continued to work in Vienna until his death in 1994. His contributions to the field of electronic and computer music have had a significant impact on contemporary music and continue to influence musicians and composers today. He is remembered as a pioneer of experimental music and a passionate advocate for the transformative power of music and technology.</p><p>In addition to his work as a composer and teacher, Logothetis was also a visual artist with a keen interest in film and video. He created several experimental films and videos that incorporated music and sound, exploring the possibilities of multimedia art. Among his notable works in this area are "Light Cones" (1968) and "Glissandi" (1972). He also worked on several collaborative projects with visual artists, including his wife, painter Maria Lassnig.</p><p>Logothetis was actively involved in the international music scene and organized several festivals and concerts throughout his career. He was a founding member of the Austrian Society for Electroacoustic Music and served as its president from 1974 to 1979. He also helped establish the Vienna Institute for Electroacoustic Music and was a member of the jury for the International Competition of Electroacoustic Music in Bourges, France.</p><p>Despite his groundbreaking work in the field of electronic and computer music, Logothetis remained humble and committed to innovation and experimentation throughout his life. His contributions to contemporary music continue to inspire and challenge musicians and composers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
