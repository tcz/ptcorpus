(March 19, 1872		Warsaw-August 12, 1918			New York City)


was
a French
singer and dancer.


					</p><p>She was born in Warsaw, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire, and moved to Paris in her late teens to pursue a career in show business. Held quickly became a sensation in Paris, known for her beauty, charm, and comedic timing. </p><p>In 1896, she made her American debut in New York City and quickly became a star on Broadway. Over the next decade, Held appeared in numerous stage productions and vaudeville shows, often wearing elaborate costumes and singing in multiple languages. </p><p>Held is also credited with popularizing the phrase "There's nothing like it, in London, Paris, or New York" in reference to the city's entertainment scene. She was known for her philanthropy, particularly her support of orphanages and hospitals, and was often referred to as "The Sweetheart of the AEF" due to her work entertaining American troops during World War I. </p><p>Sadly, Held's life was cut short when she died of multiple myeloma in 1918 at the age of 46. Despite her untimely death, she remains a legendary figure in the history of Broadway and vaudeville.</p><p>Held was married to Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., a famous Broadway producer, from 1897 to 1913. Their marriage was marked by Ziegfeld's infidelity, which caused Held great emotional pain. Their divorce was highly publicized and a source of great scandal at the time. Despite their tumultuous relationship, Ziegfeld continued to produce shows for Held and remained grateful for her contribution to his success.</p><p>Held's iconic style, which included large-brimmed hats, long gloves, and layered gowns, inspired many fashion trends in the early 1900s. She was also known for introducing the French cancan to American audiences and is credited with bringing a new level of sophistication and glamour to the world of entertainment.</p><p>Today, Held is remembered as one of the pioneers of modern show business and a trailblazer for women in the industry. Her legacy continues to inspire performers around the world, and her contributions to the development of Broadway and vaudeville cannot be overstated.</p><p>Held's popularity was not limited to the United States and France. Her fame and influence extended to England, and she successfully performed in London's prestigious theaters. Held's success in the entertainment industry was also a result of her hard work and determination. Despite facing numerous challenges in her personal life, including financial difficulties and health issues, she persevered and continued to deliver outstanding performances. Her talent, combined with her charm and beauty, allowed her to become one of the most celebrated performers of her time.</p><p>In addition to her philanthropic work, Held also used her platform to advocate for women's rights. She was an outspoken proponent of women's suffrage, a cause she had been passionate about since her early days in show business. In a time when women's voices were often ignored, Held's advocacy work was crucial in helping to bring attention to the issue.</p><p>Held's impact on the world of entertainment can still be seen today. Her signature style, which included elaborate costumes and accessories, continues to inspire fashion trends, and her contributions to Broadway and vaudeville are celebrated as an important part of the industry's history. Her legacy as a trailblazer for women in show business has also continued to inspire a new generation of performers, proving that even after more than a century, Anna Held's influence remains as strong as ever.</p><p>Throughout her career, Held was known for her impeccable sense of style and fashion. Her wardrobe was often the talk of the town, and she became a trendsetter in her own right. She was one of the first performers to introduce the iconic "flapper look" to the stage, with short bobbed hair, beaded dresses, and long necklaces. Held's style was not just limited to fashion, however; she also popularized the use of electric lighting on stage and introduced new dance styles such as the tango and the shimmy to American audiences.</p><p>In addition to her philanthropic work and advocacy for women's rights, Held was also a shrewd businesswoman. She negotiated her contracts herself, insisting on high salaries and profit-sharing agreements. She also invested in real estate and owned several properties in New York City, a rarity for women at the time.</p><p>After her death, Held's legacy continued to grow. Several biopics were made about her life, including the film "The Great Ziegfeld" in 1936, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. She was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1981, cementing her status as one of the most influential performers of her time.</p><p>Today, Held's life and career are celebrated as a testament to the power of perseverance, talent, and determination. Her impact on the world of entertainment, fashion, and philanthropy continues to inspire and influence new generations of performers and activists.</p><p></p><p>
