was
a Russian
writer, art critic, poet and playwright.


					</p><p>He was born to a Polish mother and an Italian father and spent his childhood in Italy, Monaco, and Germany. He moved to Paris in 1900 and became involved in the city's artistic and literary circles, befriending Pablo Picasso, André Breton, and other notable figures of the time. </p><p>His literary works, which include poetry collections such as "Alcools" and "Calligrammes," were known for their experimental style, combining traditional poetic forms with avant-garde techniques such as free association and visual poetry. He also wrote plays, including "The Breasts of Tiresias," which is considered a landmark of surrealist theater. </p><p>In addition to his literary pursuits, Apollinaire was an influential art critic, championing the works of artists such as Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso. He coined the term "Cubism" in reference to the style innovated by these artists. </p><p>Apollinaire's life was cut short when he died of influenza during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918, at just 38 years old. Despite the brevity of his career, his contributions to both literature and art continue to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Apollinaire is also remembered for his service in World War I. He enlisted in 1914 and was seriously wounded in 1916, sustaining a head injury that required trepanation. During his recovery, he continued to write and published his most famous collection of poems, "Calligrammes," which featured poems written in the shape of various objects. Apollinaire's experience of the war informed much of his writing, and he was particularly critical of the nationalist rhetoric that fueled the conflict. He also maintained his critical engagement with the arts, writing about the work of artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia, who were associated with the emerging Dada movement. Today, Apollinaire is considered a key figure in the development of modernist literature and is widely read and studied.</p><p></p><p>
