In 1993, a retrospective exhibition of his work was held at the National Gallery in Prague.</p><p>Wels' style was heavily influenced by the international modernist movement, which emphasized simplicity, functionality, and the use of modern materials like concrete, glass, and steel. He was particularly interested in the idea of mass production and how it could be applied to architecture to create affordable, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing buildings for the working class. His designs were known for their clean lines, geometric shapes, and the use of natural light to create an open and airy atmosphere.</p><p>In addition to his work as an architect, Wels was also an accomplished painter and graphic artist. He was part of the Devětsil group, which included some of the leading artists and writers of the Czech avant-garde. Wels was particularly interested in the relationship between art and architecture and believed that the two disciplines should work together to create a harmonious environment for people to live and work in.</p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Wels left an indelible mark on the Czech architectural landscape. His buildings are still admired for their innovative design, functionality, and beauty. Today, Wels is considered one of the leading figures of Czech modernist architecture and his legacy continues to inspire a new generation of architects and designers.</p><p></p><p>
