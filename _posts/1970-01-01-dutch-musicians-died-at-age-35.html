(May 10, 1950		Chaves, Portugal-July 10, 1985			Auckland)


was
a Dutch
photographer.


					</p><p>Fernando Pereira was born in Portugal but moved to the Netherlands at a young age. He was a well-known and highly regarded photographer who specialized in underwater photography, with his work being featured in various magazines and publications. </p><p>In the summer of 1985, Pereira was onboard the Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow Warrior, which was in New Zealand protesting against French nuclear testing in the Pacific. However, on the night of July 10th, the ship was bombed by French intelligence agents. Pereira was tragically killed in the attack, becoming the only fatality. </p><p>The bombing caused outrage throughout the world and led to a strain in relations between France and many other countries.

He began his career in photography as a photojournalist, covering various conflicts and social issues. He later turned his attention to underwater photography, and his stunning images captured the natural beauty of the ocean and its inhabitants. Pereira was a member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which aims to protect marine life and ecosystems. His photography often drew attention to environmental issues and the need for conservation efforts.</p><p>After his death, an annual photography competition was established in Pereira's name, recognizing exceptional underwater photography. The Rainbow Warrior was eventually retired and sunk off the coast of Matauri Bay in New Zealand, serving as a memorial to Pereira and the crew who were onboard during the bombing. In 2015, French President Francois Hollande publicly apologized for the attack, acknowledging the severity of the act and the loss of innocent life.

(September 11, 1915		Bukittinggi-June 12, 1951			Uithuizen)


was
a Dutch
pilot.


					</p><p>August Deibel was born in Bukittinggi, Indonesia, which was then a Dutch colony. He grew up in the Netherlands and developed a passion for aviation at a young age. Deibel joined the Dutch Air Force in 1936 and became a pilot. During World War II, he fought for the Dutch resistance and was involved in many daring missions against the Nazi occupation forces.</p><p>After the war, Deibel continued his career in aviation and became a test pilot for Fokker Aircraft. He was known for his skill and daring, and he tested many new aircraft designs. In 1951, Deibel was testing a Fokker S.14 Machtrainer when the plane crashed near Uithuizen, killing him instantly. He was only 35 years old.</p><p>August Deibel is remembered as a hero and a pioneer in Dutch aviation history. He was posthumously awarded the Resistance Memorial Cross and the Airman's Cross, two of the highest honors given to Dutch military personnel. A street near Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam is named in his honor.</p><p>During his time with the Dutch resistance, August Deibel was involved in some notable missions. He flew missions to drop supplies, smuggle people out of the country and even bomb a German destroyer. His daring mission to free 45 prisoners from a Nazi prison in Leeuwarden is particularly noteworthy. He used a captured German plane to fly low over the prison yard while resistance fighters ran out and overpowered the guards. All the prisoners were freed and the mission was a success. </p><p>After his death, the investigation into the crash of the Fokker S.14 Machtrainer found that the accident was caused by a faulty rudder. This led to a redesign of the rudder on all Fokker aircraft. </p><p>In addition to the street named after him, August Deibel has also been honored with a monument in his birthplace of Bukittinggi. The monument consists of a replica of the Fokker S.14 Machtrainer and a plaque honoring Deibel's life and contributions to aviation.</p><p></p><p>
