an English
personality.


					</p><p>Philip Bourke Marston was a Victorian poet and artist who achieved fame in the late 19th century. He was born in London, England and was the son of a prominent journalist and editor, John Westland Marston.</p><p>Despite being blind from the age of three, Marston displayed incredible talent, particularly in his poetry and artwork. His poetry was characterized by themes of sadness, melancholy, and the search for beauty in a troubled world. Marston's work also explored the experience of disability and the challenges he faced as a blind person in Victorian society.</p><p>Marston's art, which he created using a technique known as "frottage," was also notable for its ethereal, dream-like quality. His artwork often depicted mythological and allegorical scenes, and was heavily influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites and the Aesthetic Movement.</p><p>Today, Marston is remembered as an important figure in Victorian literature and art, particularly for his contributions to the discourse on disability and his unique artistic techniques.</p><p>Marston's poetry was first published in 1873, in a collection titled "Song-tide and Other Poems." This was followed by several other collections, including "A Last Harvest" and "Wind-Voices." His work was well-received by critics and the reading public alike, and was admired for its emotional depth and rich imagery.</p><p>Despite his success, Marston's life was marked by tragedy. He suffered from poor health throughout his life, and his blindness made him increasingly isolated from the world around him. In addition, he struggled with alcoholism and opium addiction, and was often in financial distress.</p><p>Marston died of tuberculosis at the age of 36, leaving behind a significant body of work that continues to be studied and celebrated today. His legacy has also inspired a renewed interest in the experience of disability in Victorian society, and the ways in which art and literature can challenge prevailing attitudes towards difference and otherness.</p><p></p><p>
