(March 7, 1940		Nuthe-Urstromtal-December 24, 1979			Aarhus)


was
a German
, .


					</p><p>Rudi Dutschke was a German student leader and political activist who played a significant role in the student movement of the 1960s in Germany. During his time as a student at the Free University of Berlin, Dutschke became a prominent figure in the Anti-Vietnam War movement, advocating for peace and democracy.</p><p>Dutschke was the leader of the Socialist German Student Union and became a target of government surveillance and repression due to his activism. In 1968, he survived an assassination attempt by a right-wing extremist, which left him severely injured and permanently disabled.</p><p>Despite his injuries, Dutschke remained politically active, writing and speaking out against imperialism and advocating for a more egalitarian society. He spent the last years of his life in Denmark, where he continued to be a respected figure in left-wing circles until his untimely death at the age of 39.</p><p>Dutschke was born in Nuthe-Urstromtal, Germany, and grew up in poverty after his father was killed during World War II. He later moved to West Berlin to study sociology at the Free University of Berlin, where he became involved in left-wing politics and social activism. Dutschke was heavily influenced by the ideas of Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse, who taught at the university and became a mentor to him.</p><p>Throughout the 1960s, Dutschke was a key figure in the German student movement, advocating for a radical transformation of society and rejecting traditional German values. He was a leading voice in the protests against the Vietnam War and the authoritarian regime of then-West German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger. </p><p>After his assassination attempt, Dutschke suffered from partial paralysis and severe brain damage. He underwent extensive medical treatment and rehabilitation but never fully recovered from his injuries. Despite his physical limitations, he continued to write and speak on behalf of the oppressed and marginalized, becoming a symbol of resistance against fascism and imperialism.</p><p>Dutschke's legacy continues to inspire generations of activists and revolutionaries in Germany and beyond. His ideas and principles have been the subject of countless books, articles, and documentaries, and his name has become synonymous with the struggle for freedom, justice, and equality.</p><p>Dutschke's impact on the student movement in Germany was significant, as he helped to mobilize a new generation of young people who were committed to challenging the status quo and calling for social justice. His ideas and activism had a lasting impact on German society, and his legacy is still felt today. Dutschke's wife, Gretchen, also became an important figure in the left-wing movement in Germany, and she worked tirelessly to promote her husband's ideas and to carry on his legacy after his death. Together, they were a powerful force for change and an inspiration to many who came after them. Dutschke's life and work continue to be remembered and celebrated, and his contributions to the struggle for social justice are an important part of Germany's history.</p><p></p><p>
