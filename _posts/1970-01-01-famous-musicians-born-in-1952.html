						</p><p>musician and computer engineer. He was the bassist for the rock band Iron Butterfly during the 1970s and later became involved in computer engineering. Kramer was known for his work on a revolutionary transportation system called the Skyway that was designed to alleviate traffic in urban areas. Sadly, he disappeared in 1995 and his body was found four years later in a remote area of California. The circumstances surrounding his death remain unknown and controversial, with some speculating foul play may have been involved.</p><p>Kramer was born in Youngstown, Ohio, and grew up in a musical household. He started playing music at a young age and quickly developed a passion for it. In the early 1970s, he joined the legendary rock band Iron Butterfly, best known for their hit song "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida." Kramer played bass and sang backup vocals for the band during their reunion tour in the late 1970s.</p><p>After leaving Iron Butterfly, Kramer became interested in computer engineering and enrolled in college to study the subject. He eventually became a consultant and worked for a number of technology companies, including IBM and Northrop Grumman. Kramer's fascination with technology led him to develop a new transportation system called the Skyway, which he believed would revolutionize the way people traveled in urban areas.</p><p>Kramer's disappearance in 1995 shocked those who knew him. He had been on his way to the airport when he vanished, leaving behind his car and all of his belongings. For years, there were no clues as to what had happened to him, and his family and friends were left devastated. Then, in 1999, his remains were found in a remote area of California. The cause of his death remains unknown, and there are many theories about what might have happened to him. Some believe that he was the victim of foul play, while others think that he may have become disoriented and lost his way. Despite the mystery surrounding his death, Kramer's contributions to music and technology have left a lasting legacy.</p><p>Kramer was a multi-talented individual who always pursued his passions with fervor. In addition to his musical and technological endeavors, he was also a licensed pilot and a skilled martial artist. He achieved a black belt in Taekwondo and even trained with the famous martial artist, Chuck Norris. Kramer was also known for his philanthropic work and dedication to helping those in need. He was involved in several charity organizations, including a group that provided assistance to victims of natural disasters.</p><p>Kramer's legacy lives on through his contributions to music and technology. His work on the Skyway system continues to inspire and influence transportation design, and his musical talent has left a lasting impact on the rock music genre. Despite the mystery surrounding his death, Philip Taylor Kramer will always be remembered as a passionate and brilliant individual who made significant contributions to multiple fields.</p><p>Kramer's family established the Philip Taylor Kramer Foundation after his death in order to promote the causes he cared about. The foundation supports a variety of initiatives, including science and technology education, disaster relief, and environmental conservation. In addition, Kramer's work with Iron Butterfly has remained a part of rock music history and continues to influence generations of musicians. His distinctive bass playing can be heard on the band's classic albums, including Heavy and Scorching Beauty. Despite his tragic end, Kramer's life and career serve as an inspiration to those who are passionate about exploring new ideas and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.</p><p></p><p>
