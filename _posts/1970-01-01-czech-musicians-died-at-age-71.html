(June 9, 1843		Prague-June 21, 1914			Vienna)


was
a Czech
journalist, novelist and peace activist.


					</p><p>She is best known for her novel "Die Waffen nieder!" (Lay Down Your Arms!), which became an international bestseller and led her to become the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1905. Bertha von Suttner was raised in a noble family and became a governess to different families, which exposed her to the harsh realities of war. She became an active peace activist promoting disarmament and developing relationships with prominent peace advocates such as Alfred Nobel and Andrew Carnegie. She also co-founded the Austrian Peace Society and served as its president for 21 years. Bertha von Suttner's legacy continues to inspire and influence peace movements around the world.</p><p>In addition to her work as a novelist and peace activist, Bertha von Suttner was also a prolific journalist. She wrote for various newspapers and publications, including the prestigious Neue Freie Presse in Vienna, where she was the first woman to work as a regular correspondent. Her articles on political and social issues were widely read and respected throughout Europe. She was also a frequent speaker at conferences and events, using her platform to promote the cause of peace.</p><p>Bertha von Suttner was a strong advocate for women's rights and suffrage. She believed that women had a unique role to play in the peace movement, and worked tirelessly to encourage more women to become involved in the cause. She was a member of the International Council of Women and helped to organize the first International Women's Congress for Peace in The Hague in 1915, the year after her death.</p><p>Despite facing criticism and opposition from some quarters, Bertha von Suttner never wavered in her commitment to peace. She continued to work for disarmament and international cooperation until the end of her life, and her legacy as a pioneering peace activist and feminist continues to inspire new generations of activists and thinkers.</p><p>In addition to her many accomplishments, Bertha von Suttner was also a polyglot, fluent in several languages including German, English, French, and Italian. She used her linguistic abilities to travel throughout Europe and promote the cause of peace, often serving as a translator for other activists and speakers at international conferences.</p><p>Throughout her life, Bertha von Suttner maintained a close friendship with Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite who established the Nobel Prizes in his will. It is said that her incessant urging of Nobel to use his fortune for peaceful endeavors, rather than for the development of weapons, led to his decision to establish the Nobel Peace Prize. When she was eventually named as the first woman to win the award in 1905, she used the prize money to establish an Austrian Peace Society school for girls.</p><p>Bertha von Suttner's impact on the peace movement can still be felt today. Her notion of "no war, no peace" and the idea that peace is not just the absence of war, but a continuous effort towards disarmament and the promotion of understanding still resonate with activists around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(April 10, 1850		Seč-January 26, 1922			Prague)


was
a Czech
physicist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his contributions to the study of fluid dynamics, particularly the Strouhal number which describes the relationship between the frequency of vortex shedding and the velocity of a fluid stream. Strouhal's work was instrumental in the development of modern aerodynamics and laid the foundation for the study of a wide range of subjects related to fluid mechanics. He was also a professor at Charles University in Prague and played an important role in the development of physics education and research in Czechoslovakia. In addition to his scientific work, Strouhal was also an accomplished musician and played the organ at the Church of St. Nicholas in Prague.</p><p>Strouhal was born in Seč, a small town in eastern Bohemia. His father was a miller and Strouhal spent his early years working in the family mill. Despite this, he showed a strong aptitude for mathematics and physics and eventually went on to study at Charles University in Prague. After completing his studies, Strouhal was appointed to a teaching position at the university and began his research in fluid dynamics.</p><p>In 1878, Strouhal observed that when a fluid flows past an object, such as a cylinder or a wing, it can create vortices that shed from the object's surface. He discovered that the frequency of these vortices is proportional to the fluid velocity and to the inverse of the object's size, which became known as the Strouhal number. This work was crucial in understanding the behavior of fluids and led to the development of many key concepts in modern aerodynamics.</p><p>Strouhal's work in fluid dynamics was recognized around the world and he received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to the field. He was a member of several prestigious scientific societies, including the Royal Society in London and the National Academy of Sciences in the United States.</p><p>In addition to his scientific achievements, Strouhal was a talented musician, and played the organ at the Church of St. Nicholas in Prague for over 40 years. He also had a deep appreciation for art and was an avid collector of paintings.</p><p>Today, Strouhal is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of fluid dynamics and his name is still widely recognized in the field. His contributions continue to shape our understanding of the behavior of fluids and have applications in everything from airplane design to weather forecasting.</p><p>Later in his career, Strouhal became interested in acoustics and the study of sound waves. He conducted experiments on the relationship between frequency and the speed of sound, discovering what is now known as Strouhal's law. He also investigated the acoustics of organ pipes and wrote several papers on the subject, combining his love of music with his scientific pursuits. </p><p>During his lifetime, Strouhal published over one hundred scientific papers and played a key role in the development of Czech physics. He was a dedicated teacher and mentor, helping to train a generation of physicists who went on to make their own significant contributions to the field. Strouhal passed away in 1922 in Prague, leaving behind a lasting legacy in both science and music.</p><p></p><p>

He was also a co-founder of the Future Systems Forum, a group dedicated to exploring innovative design concepts and their potential impact on society.</p><p>Despite his groundbreaking designs, Kaplický's work was not without controversy. Some critics accused him of sacrificing functionality in favor of style, and his designs were often seen as too avant-garde for many traditionalists. Nevertheless, his influence on the field of architecture is widely recognized and his designs continue to inspire and provoke discussion.</p><p>Following Kaplický's death, his company Future Systems was dissolved, and many of his designs remained unrealized. However, his legacy continued to influence architecture and design, and his work was celebrated in exhibitions and retrospectives around the world. In 2012, the Design Museum in London held an exhibition titled "Jan Kaplický: The Drawings," showcasing his intricate and imaginative drawings and sketches of buildings and structures.
