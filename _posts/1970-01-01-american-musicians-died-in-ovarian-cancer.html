She continued to act on stage and in European films in the 1950s and 1960s, but eventually retired from acting in the early 1970s. </p><p>Haas was also known for her singing, and recorded several albums of popular songs in both German and English.

She went on to star in several major films throughout the decade, including "Crime on the Night Express" (1937) and "Das Mädchen Johanna" (1935).</p><p>As Nazi Germany began to rise to power, Haas and her husband Franz Waxman, who was also Jewish, made the decision to leave the country and move to Hollywood. In Hollywood, Haas struggled to achieve the same level of success she had in Germany. She was often typecast in roles as a European immigrant or as the romantic interest of male leads. Despite this, she continued to work in film and on stage in the United States and Europe.</p><p>Haas' talents were not limited to acting; she was also a skilled singer. She recorded several albums of popular songs in both German and English, showcasing her versatility and range as a performer. Haas' legacy in the entertainment industry is one of perseverance and dedication to her craft, despite facing obstacles and adversity throughout her career.</p><p></p><p>
