(May 10, 1838		Bel Air-April 26, 1865			Port Royal)


was
an American
actor.


					</p><p>However, Booth is mostly known for assassinating President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865, while he was watching a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. The assassination of Lincoln was part of a larger conspiracy by Booth and his accomplices to also assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward. After carrying out the assassination, Booth went on the run and was eventually found and killed by Union soldiers in a barn. Booth's actions have gone down in history and he is often remembered as one of the most notorious assassins in American history.</p><p>Aside from his infamous act of assassination, John Wilkes Booth had a successful career as an actor performing in various productions across the United States. He came from a well-known acting family and was considered one of the most handsome and talented actors of his time. However, during the Civil War, Booth became a Confederate sympathizer and was fiercely opposed to Lincoln's policies. He vehemently opposed the abolition of slavery and believed in states' rights. </p><p>Booth's assassination of Lincoln had a profound impact on American history and politics. It was a pivotal moment in the already tumultuous time of the Civil War and its aftermath. The country mourned the loss of Lincoln, who was widely beloved for his leadership during the war, and Booth's actions led to a period of national upheaval and uncertainty. </p><p>In the years since the assassination, there has been much speculation and mystery surrounding Booth and his motivations. Some have questioned whether he acted alone or was part of a larger conspiracy. Despite the uncertainty surrounding his actions, Booth has remained a prominent figure in American history and is often studied and discussed in the context of the Civil War and its aftermath.</p><p>Booth's death also marked the end of his family's acting dynasty. His father and brothers were also well-known actors and had achieved a great deal of success in the theater world. However, after Booth's assassination of Lincoln, the family name became synonymous with treachery and betrayal. Many theaters refused to hire actors from the Booth family, and their careers suffered greatly as a result. Booth's infamous legacy has continued to haunt his family for generations. Despite this, the Booth family has worked to distance themselves from John Wilkes Booth and his actions. Today, many members of the family are involved in philanthropic and humanitarian efforts, and they work to honor the legacy of the family in positive ways.</p><p>Booth's death, which occurred 12 days after he assassinated Lincoln, was the result of a gunshot wound to the neck inflicted by Sergeant Boston Corbett of the Union Army. Booth had been on the run and hiding out in a barn in Virginia when he was discovered by Union soldiers. After Booth refused to surrender, the soldiers set the barn on fire in an attempt to flush him out. When Booth emerged from the burning barn, Corbett, a member of the detachment, shot him. Despite his injuries, Booth was able to speak briefly before succumbing to his wounds several hours later. The controversial nature of Booth's death has led to various conspiracy theories and debates about whether he was capable of speaking and whether he was actually killed by Corbett or someone else. Nonetheless, Booth remains a fascinating and complex figure in American history and his legacy continues to be studied and debated to this day.</p><p></p><p>
