(February 12, 1809		The Mount, Shrewsbury-April 19, 1882			Down House)

	
		a.k.a. Charles Robert Darwin or Darwin, Charles

	
was
a British
naturalist, biologist, geologist, scientist and writer.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Horace Darwin, Anne Darwin, Henrietta Litchfield, Mary Eleanor Darwin, Elizabeth Darwin, Francis Darwin, Leonard Darwin, Charles Waring Darwin, George Darwin and William Erasmus Darwin.

						</p><p>Darwin is best known for his work on the theory of evolution by natural selection. He traveled extensively on HMS Beagle, which provided him with vast opportunities to observe and study the flora and fauna of various places. His subsequent work on natural selection, published in his book "On the Origin of Species," revolutionized the way humans understand the process of evolution. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society, played a significant role in the founding of the scientific field of ecology, and made important contributions to the study of earthworms and orchids. Darwin's theories remain a significant influence on modern biology and continue to be debated and discussed by scientists and scholars around the world.</p><p>Darwin's scientific theories and findings had a significant impact on the fields of biology, geology, anthropology, and many others. His contributions were so broad that the term "Darwinism" was coined to describe his body of work. He also wrote extensively on human evolution and the descent of man, which generated significant controversy at the time. Despite facing strong opposition from religious figures and conservative thinkers, Darwin continued to defend his ideas with rigor and passion.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Darwin was also a prolific letter writer and correspondent, exchanging letters with many prominent figures of his time. He suffered from various health problems throughout his life, and spent much of his later years at his home in Kent, known as Down House. Today, the house is a museum dedicated to his life and work.</p><p>Darwin's impact on science and society continues to this day, with ongoing research exploring the implications of his theories for human health, genetics, and the environment. His legacy reminds us of the power of observation, curiosity, and intellectual bravery in advancing our understanding of the world around us.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of coronary thrombosis.

He also made important contributions to mathematical education and wrote several influential textbooks. Today, Cayley's work is still studied and used by mathematicians around the world.</p><p>Cayley's interest in mathematics was first sparked by a book on geometry that he read when he was only 14 years old. He was later admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he flourished in his studies and developed his mathematical abilities, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1842 and a Master of Arts degree in 1845.</p><p>Cayley's contributions to mathematics are numerous and varied. He is perhaps best known for his work in algebra, where he developed the theory of matrices, a concept that is now widely used in many areas of mathematics, physics, and engineering. Cayley also made important contributions to the study of geometry, including the development of non-Euclidean geometries and the theory of projective geometry. In addition, he developed group theory, a branch of algebra that studies symmetry and structure.</p><p>Cayley's contributions to mathematics were widely recognized during his lifetime, and he was awarded numerous honors and awards. In addition to his work in mathematics, Cayley was also interested in languages, speaking several languages fluently and making important contributions to the study of both English and modern Hebrew.</p><p>Today, Cayley's legacy lives on through his numerous mathematical contributions and his impact on the field of mathematics as a whole.</p><p></p><p>

(August 6, 1881		Lochfield-March 11, 1955			London)


was
a British
biologist, scientist and pharmacologist.


					
			
		His child
		is
		called
		Robert Fleming.

						</p><p>Alexander Fleming is best known for his discovery of penicillin, the first antibiotic. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945, along with Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, for their work in developing penicillin. Fleming was born in Scotland and studied medicine at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in London. He served in World War I as a medical officer, which later inspired his work on developing antiseptics and antibiotics to combat infections in wounded soldiers. In addition to penicillin, Fleming also made significant contributions to the study of bacteriology and immunology. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1943 and was knighted in 1944.</p><p>Fleming's interest in bacteriology led him to investigate the properties of lysozyme, an enzyme that has antibacterial properties. He discovered penicillin by accident in 1928, when he noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum had contaminated one of his petri dishes and was inhibiting the growth of a bacteria culture he had been studying. This led him to investigate further and ultimately develop the first antibiotic, which revolutionized medicine and saved countless lives. Fleming is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of medicine, and his discovery of penicillin is considered one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century.</p><p></p><p>

Rivers also made significant contributions to military history, serving as a colonel in the British Army and helping to develop new infantry tactics.</p><p>Rivers' interest in archaeology was sparked during his military service in Ireland, where he observed the destruction of historical sites during the construction of military barracks. His pioneering work in systematic archaeological excavation methods, including the use of grid systems and detailed record-keeping, set the standard for future archaeological practices. He also championed the importance of context and stratigraphy in interpreting artifacts, and his approach to analyzing material culture as a reflection of social and economic developments paved the way for the field of cultural anthropology.</p><p>Aside from his scholarly pursuits, Rivers was also known for his progressive social views. He supported the education of working-class children and advocated for the rights of indigenous peoples. His legacy has continued to influence the discipline of archaeology and anthropology, and his contributions to our understanding of human history and culture are still celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>
