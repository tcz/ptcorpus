(May 3, 1898		Kiev-December 8, 1978			Jerusalem)

	
		a.k.a. Golda Meyerson, Golda Mabovich, Goldie Mabovitch or Golda Mabovitch

	
was
an Israeli
politician, diplomat and teacher.


					
			
		She had
		two
		children,
		Sarah Meyerson and Menachem Meyerson.

						</p><p>After immigrating to then-Palestine in the early 1920s, Golda Meir became heavily involved in the Zionist movement, helping to establish Kibbutz Merhavia and serving as a leader in the Labor Zionist party. She also represented the Jewish Agency in the United States during World War II, working to secure support for the creation of a Jewish state. </p><p>In 1948, Meir played a key role in the establishment of the State of Israel and served as a member of the new government, eventually rising to the position of Prime Minister in 1969. During her time in office, Meir dealt with a number of crises, including the Munich Olympics massacre and the Yom Kippur War. </p><p>Meir was known for her blunt and straightforward style, as well as her commitment to the socialist ideals of the Labor Party. She retired from politics in 1974 and passed away in 1978.</p><p>Golda Meir was born in Kiev, Ukraine, and grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She was the third of eight children in a family of Jewish immigrants. Meir grew up with a strong sense of Zionism and a belief in the importance of establishing a Jewish homeland. She attended teachers' college in Milwaukee and later moved to Palestine, where she worked as a teacher and a secretary for the Histadrut labor union. Meir's leadership abilities soon became evident, and she became involved in the Zionist movement, working to promote Jewish immigration to Palestine and the establishment of a Jewish state. </p><p>During World War II, Meir worked to secure American support for the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. She later served as Israel's ambassador to the Soviet Union and as Foreign Minister before becoming Prime Minister in 1969. Despite significant opposition, Meir was a strong supporter of the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. </p><p>As Prime Minister, Meir was faced with a number of crises, including the Munich Olympics massacre in which 11 Israeli athletes were killed by Palestinian terrorists, and the Yom Kippur War with Egypt and Syria in 1973. Meir's leadership during these crises was widely admired, although she was criticized for failing to prevent the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War. </p><p>After retiring from politics, Meir continued to be an influential figure in Israeli society, speaking out on a wide range of issues. She died in 1978 at the age of 80, and was mourned by people across the political spectrum in Israel and around the world.</p><p>In addition to her political contributions, Golda Meir was also known for her feminist activism. She was a strong advocate for women's rights, and fought for women's education and equal pay. Meir famously said, "Whether women are better than men I cannot say - but I can say they are certainly no worse." She also made history as the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Israel and one of the only female world leaders at the time. Meir's legacy continues to influence Israeli society, particularly in the areas of women's rights and politics. She is often remembered as a strong and decisive leader who played a crucial role in the development of modern Israel.</p><p>Meir's determination and leadership qualities were evident from a young age, when she organized a fundraiser to pay for textbooks for poor students in her school. Her passion for education remained throughout her life, and she once again demonstrated it during her tenure as Prime Minister. She oversaw a significant expansion of Israel's education system, especially for young children from disadvantaged communities. Today, many schools and universities in Israel are named after Meir, in recognition of her contributions to education and society. </p><p>Meir's life was not without controversy, with some criticizing her for her hardline stance on Palestinian issues, particularly regarding settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, her legacy remains an important part of Israeli history, and her leadership during some of the country's most difficult moments is widely admired. Meir's famous quote, "Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life," continues to inspire people around the world.</p><p>Meir's political career was marked by many successes and achievements, but perhaps none more significant than her role in the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. As a member of the Jewish Agency, Meir worked tirelessly to promote the idea of a Jewish homeland, and played a key role in securing international recognition for the state. Her efforts were successful, and on May 14, 1948, Israel declared its independence. Meir later wrote that this was "the proudest moment of my life."</p><p>Throughout her career, Meir was known for her strong and unwavering commitment to the principles of Zionism and the creation of a Jewish state. She believed deeply in the importance of Jewish self-determination and saw Israel as a beacon of hope for Jews around the world. Meir's dedication to this cause was evident in everything she did, from her work as a teacher and a leader in the Labor Zionist party, to her role in the new government as Minister of Labor and Social Welfare.</p><p>Despite her many accomplishments, Meir's life was not without personal tragedy. Her marriage to Morris Meyerson was strained by her political career and his ill health, and the couple eventually divorced. Meir was also deeply affected by the Munich Olympics massacre, in which 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were killed by Palestinian terrorists. She later wrote that "the happiest and most fulfilling years of my life were behind me from that day on."</p><p>Despite these setbacks, Meir remained a powerful and influential figure in Israeli politics until her retirement in 1974. Her contributions to the country's development and her unwavering commitment to its ideals continue to inspire people around the world today.</p><p>In addition to her political career, Golda Meir was also a prolific writer, penning several memoirs and books throughout her life. Her most famous work, "My Life," was published in 1975 and provides a detailed account of her upbringing, political career, and personal life. Meir was also an accomplished orator, known for her powerful speeches and ability to connect with audiences of all backgrounds. She once said, "One cannot and must not try to erase the past merely because it does not fit the present."</p><p>Meir's legacy as a female leader in a male-dominated field has inspired generations of women to pursue careers in politics and public service. She paved the way for future female leaders in Israel and around the world, demonstrating that women can be just as competent and effective as men in positions of power. Meir's commitment to social justice and equality also remains an important part of her legacy, inspiring activists and advocates to continue fighting for these values today.</p><p>Overall, Golda Meir was a complex and multifaceted figure, whose life and career spanned some of the most tumultuous moments in Israeli and world history. Despite facing significant challenges and obstacles throughout her life, Meir never lost sight of her ultimate goal - to create a prosperous and peaceful Jewish state in the land of Israel. Her unwavering commitment to this goal and her enduring legacy as a leader, activist, and champion for women's rights make her a true inspiration to people around the world.</p><p></p><p>
