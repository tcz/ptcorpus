					</p><p>He was the first modern Olympic champion in swimming, having won two gold medals in the 1896 Athens Olympics. He won the gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle and the 1,200-meter freestyle swimming events. Later in his career, he became an architect, designing numerous buildings and structures around Hungary.

Hajos was also a writer and journalist, and he contributed to many newspapers and magazines throughout his life. He died in Budapest in 1955 at the age of 77.</p><p>Hajos was born in Budapest to a Jewish family, and spent his childhood in Obuda, a town on the outskirts of Budapest. As a child, he started swimming in the Danube River and soon became very skilled at it. When he was 18, he moved to Berlin to study architecture, where he started training with the swimming club "Berliner Sports Club".

Despite not being affiliated with any swimming club in Hungary at the time, he was chosen to represent the country in the Olympics, and went on to win both of his events.</p><p>After retiring from swimming, Hajos focused on his career as an architect. He designed various buildings, including churches, schools, and apartment buildings.

(May 26, 1912		Transleithania-July 6, 1989			Budapest)

	
		also known as Janos Kadar

	
was
a Hungarian
politician.


					</p><p>He served as the General Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party from 1956 to 1988 and the Prime Minister of Hungary from 1956 to 1958 and again from 1961 to 1965. Kádár came to power after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, which was suppressed by Soviet forces. He was initially considered a moderate within the communist party, advocating for reform and a more relaxed policy towards the West. However, he later became a hardliner and maintained close ties with the Soviet Union. During his tenure, Kádár implemented several economic and social reforms, including the introduction of limited market elements and decentralization in agriculture. Despite his efforts, Hungary continued to suffer from economic difficulties and political repression under his rule. Kádár resigned in 1988 amidst massive protests and a wave of democratization across Eastern Europe. He died the following year.</p><p>Kádár was born into a working-class family in what was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He became involved in politics at a young age, joining the Communist Party of Hungary in 1931. He was arrested and imprisoned multiple times for his political activities, including during World War II. After the war, Kádár joined the government as Minister of Interior under the Soviet-backed regime. </p><p>Kádár's leadership was marked by a complex relationship with the Soviet Union. While he maintained close ties with Moscow, he was not afraid to challenge Soviet authority when he believed it was in Hungary's interest. For example, he refused to participate in the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. </p><p>Despite his reputation as a hardliner, Kádár was known for his somewhat paternalistic approach to governance. He famously declared that the "Hungarian people deserve a good life" and took steps to improve living conditions, access to healthcare, and education. However, his reforms were ultimately not enough to satisfy growing discontent within the population. </p><p>After his resignation, Kádár lived out his remaining years in relative obscurity. His legacy remains controversial in Hungary to this day, with some praising his efforts to improve living conditions while others condemn him for his role in the suppression of dissent.</p><p></p><p>

(October 25, 1886		Vienna-April 23, 1964)


was
a Hungarian
economist and economic historian.


					</p><p>Polanyi is best known for his book "The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time", published in 1944, which analyzes the emergence of market-based societies in the 19th century and the impact of this transformation on social relationships and institutions. He argued that the market economy is not a natural or inevitable system, but rather a social construct that requires specific policies and institutions to function effectively. Polanyi also wrote extensively about the history and anthropology of economic systems, examining the role of reciprocity, redistribution, and household production in non-market societies. His work has influenced a wide range of scholars in fields such as sociology, anthropology, and political science, and has been cited as an important critique of free-market ideology.</p><p>Polanyi was born into a Jewish family in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now Austria). He studied law and economics at the University of Budapest and later moved to Vienna to pursue graduate studies in economics. In 1919, he became a member of the Hungarian delegation to negotiate the Treaty of Trianon after World War I. When Hungary became a Soviet Republic in 1919, he joined the government as chief economic adviser.</p><p>Polanyi was forced to flee Hungary after the collapse of the Soviet Republic, and he settled in Vienna. He was involved in socialist politics and was a member of the Austrian Social Democratic Party. In 1933, he emigrated to England with his wife, Ilona Duczynska, who was also a prominent socialist activist. </p><p>In England, Polanyi worked at the London School of Economics and became involved in the socialist movement. He was a member of the Independent Labour Party and was active in anti-fascist campaigns. During World War II, he worked for the British government as an economic analyst.</p><p>Polanyi's ideas on economic systems and the role of the state in regulating markets continue to have relevance in contemporary debates about globalization and economic inequality. His writings have also been influential in the development of economic sociology and economic anthropology, and his emphasis on the social embeddedness of economic institutions has led to a renewed interest in non-market forms of economic organization.</p><p></p><p>

					</p><p>Hild is considered one of the most important architects of the 19th century in Hungary.

He also designed several important churches, including the Cathedral of Szeged and the Basilica of Esztergom, which is the largest church in Hungary. Hild was recognized for his exceptional skill as an architect, and in 1833 he was elected a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He died in Pest at the age of 77.</p><p>Throughout his career, József Hild has been regarded as one of the most significant neo-Gothic architects in Hungary.
