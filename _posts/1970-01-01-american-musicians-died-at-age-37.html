(June 19, 1903		Yorkville-June 2, 1941			Riverdale)

	
		also known as The Iron Horse, Henry Louis Gehrig, Lou, Buster, Ludwig Heinrich Gehrig, Larrupin&#039; Lou, Biscuit Pants, Henry Louis &quot;Lou&quot; Gehrig or Henry Louis &quot;Buster&quot; Gehrig

	
was
an American
baseball player and actor.


					</p><p>Gehrig was a first baseman who played for the New York Yankees for 17 seasons from 1923 to 1939. He was one of the greatest baseball players in history, known for his powerful swing and his incredible durability, playing in a then-record 2,130 consecutive games. Gehrig was a seven-time All-Star, won six World Series championships with the Yankees, and was the American League MVP twice. He had a career batting average of .340 and hit 493 home runs. Gehrig retired from baseball in 1939 when he was diagnosed with ALS, a disease which is now commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Despite his health struggles, he remained positive and delivered his famous "luckiest man" speech at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939. After his death in 1941, Gehrig was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. In addition to his baseball career, Gehrig also appeared in several films including "Rawhide" and "The Pride of the Yankees," a biographical film about his life.</p><p>Off the field, Gehrig was known for his quiet and humble personality, earning him the nickname "The Iron Horse" for his reliable and consistent performance. He was well-respected by teammates, fans, and opponents alike. In 1933, he married Eleanor Twitchell, whom he had met at a dance in Chicago. The couple had no children. Gehrig's diagnosis of ALS was a shock to the baseball community and the public. After his retirement, he dedicated his time to raising awareness and funding for research into the disease. The Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, which recognizes players who exhibit character and integrity both on and off the field, was established in his honor in 1955. Gehrig's legacy continues to inspire and impact the world of baseball and beyond.</p><p>Gehrig was born in Yorkville, Manhattan to German immigrant parents. Growing up, he excelled in baseball, football, and basketball. He attended Columbia University but left after just two years to pursue a career in baseball. Gehrig was signed by the New York Yankees in 1923 and made his major league debut later that same year. His impressive performance on the field quickly earned him the nickname "The Iron Horse." </p><p>Gehrig's consecutive game streak began in 1925 and lasted for 14 years until he had to sit out due to his illness. His durability and reliability on the field were a testament to his work ethic and commitment to the sport. Despite his illness, Gehrig remained active in baseball, serving as a coach for the Yankees and appearing at various events.</p><p>In addition to his philanthropic efforts for ALS research, Gehrig was known for his charitable work with children. He set up the Lou Gehrig Youth Fund and would often spend time with sick children in hospitals, bringing them toys and raising their spirits. </p><p>In 1942, a year after Gehrig's death, the New York Yankees retired his number, making him the first player in Major League Baseball history to receive such an honor. Gehrig's legacy continues to live on in the hearts of baseball fans, and his incredible career and life continue to inspire many to this day.</p><p>Gehrig's impressive baseball career was marked by numerous achievements and accolades. He was a two-time AL batting champion, a four-time RBI champion, and a member of the 1934 AL All-Star team. In 1931, he hit four home runs in a single game, a feat only 16 players have accomplished in baseball history. In 1939, the same year of his retirement, Gehrig was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards in the United States.</p><p>Despite his unparalleled success on the field, Gehrig remained humble and dedicated to his craft. He once famously quipped, "I'm not a headline guy. I know that as long as I was following Ruth to the plate I could have stood on my head and no one would have known the difference."</p><p>Gehrig's battle with ALS, a disease that takes control of the body's motor functions, made him a symbol of strength and perseverance in the face of adversity. His "luckiest man" speech, delivered on July 4, 1939, stands as one of the most heart-wrenching moments in sports history. In it, Gehrig stated, "Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth." Despite facing a terminal illness, Gehrig remained positive and grateful for the many blessings he had received in his life.</p><p>Lou Gehrig's legacy has extended far beyond the world of baseball. His tireless work to raise awareness and funds for ALS research inspired the establishment of many organizations focused on finding a cure for the debilitating disease. His life and career continue to be an inspiration for countless individuals who strive to embody his spirit of determination, hard work, and humility.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

(March 4, 1826		Bridgeport-November 2, 1863)

	
		also known as Theodore Dehone Judah

	
was
an American
entrepreneur and engineer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his role in the construction of the first transcontinental railroad in the United States. Judah was a driving force behind the idea of a railroad that would connect the East Coast to the West Coast, and he spent years lobbying government officials and searching for investors to make his vision a reality. He ultimately helped to form the Central Pacific Railroad Company, which was instrumental in building a portion of the railroad that ran through the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. Despite facing many challenges, including difficult terrain and financial setbacks, Judah's perseverance and engineering expertise were key to the success of the project. Today, he is remembered as an important figure in American transportation history.</p><p>Before his successful involvement in the Central Pacific Railroad project, Judah had several engineering and surveying jobs, including surveying for potential routes for a transcontinental railroad. He also spent time in California during its Gold Rush, where he gained valuable knowledge of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and their potential for a railroad route. Judah was known for his technical expertise in the field of railroad engineering, which he further honed during his work on the Sacramento Valley Railroad. Additionally, he was instrumental in convincing Abraham Lincoln to sign the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862, which provided funding for the construction of the transcontinental railroad. Despite his contributions, Judah faced discrimination and opposition due to his Jewish heritage. In his honor, California designated April 4th as "Theodore Judah Day," and he was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006.</p><p>After Judah's death, his widow Anna, donated his collection of maps, surveys and reports to the Smithsonian Institution. This collection served as a fundamental source of information for those working on the construction of the transcontinental railroad. Judah's legacy also continued through his colleagues who went on to complete the transcontinental railroad, as well as through the many towns and cities that developed along the railroad route. In addition to his railway engineering contributions, Judah was also involved in the development of hydroelectric power and was a founding member of the American Society of Civil Engineers. He was a visionary leader who played a significant role in the expansion of transportation infrastructure and the development of the American West.</p><p>Judah's pioneering work on the transcontinental railroad helped reshape American transportation and commerce, making it possible for people and goods to travel across the country more quickly and efficiently than ever before. His engineering expertise helped overcome many of the technical challenges of constructing a railroad through the challenging terrain of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Without Judah's leadership and technical skills, it is unlikely that the transcontinental railroad would have been completed as quickly or successfully. Despite facing discrimination during his lifetime, Judah's legacy continues to inspire those working in transportation and engineering fields today. His contributions to American infrastructure and society are still felt today, more than 150 years after his death.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of yellow fever.
