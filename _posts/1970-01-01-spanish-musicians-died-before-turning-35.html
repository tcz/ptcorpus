(May 23, 1905-October 29, 1936)


was
a Spanish
politician, novelist and journalist.


					</p><p>He was a pioneer of Spanish fascism and founded the political party Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (JONS) alongside other intellectuals in 1931. Ledesma Ramos was a leading figure in the far-right movement in Spain in the 1930s, and his writings influenced the ideology of the Falange, the Spanish fascist party that emerged during the Spanish Civil War. In addition to his political activities, Ledesma Ramos was also a prolific writer, publishing several novels and essays, including "Towards a New State" and "The War of the Intellectuals." He was assassinated in 1936 by Republican forces during the early days of the Spanish Civil War. Despite his controversial political views, Ledesma Ramos is still remembered for his contributions to Spanish literature and his role as a major figure in the country's history.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos was born in Alfaraz de Sayago, a municipality in the province of Zamora, Spain. He studied law at the University of Madrid but dropped out before graduating to pursue a career as a journalist. In the early 1920s, he became involved in far-right politics and joined the Spanish Patriotic Union, a nationalist organization. He later became disillusioned with the Union's lack of action and founded the JONS as a more radical alternative.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos, a charismatic speaker, quickly rose to prominence in the JONS and became the editor of the party's newspaper, La Conquista del Estado (The Conquest of the State). He advocated for a totalitarian state modeled after the fascist regimes in Italy and Germany and rejected both liberalism and communism.</p><p>During the 1930s, Ledesma Ramos's ideas gained a following among Spanish intellectuals and artists, including the renowned poet Federico Garcia Lorca. However, his extremist views and his party's violent tactics also made him a target of socialist and anarchist groups, who saw him as a threat to Spain's democracy.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos's assassination in 1936 marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, which would last for three years and result in the victory of General Francisco Franco's Nationalists. Despite the controversy surrounding his political legacy, Ledesma Ramos is still acknowledged as an important figure in Spanish history and his ideas continue to influence far-right movements in Spain and beyond.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos was also a member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Jurisprudence and Legislation and worked as a lawyer for several years before fully dedicating himself to his political and literary pursuits. He was known for his passionate speeches and his unwavering commitment to his political beliefs, which he saw as a necessary response to what he perceived as the failures of liberal democracy and socialism in Spain.</p><p>In addition to his work with the JONS, Ledesma Ramos was involved with several other far-right organizations, including the Spanish Falange and the National Syndicalist Institute. He also wrote for several right-wing newspapers and magazines, including the influential publication Accion Espanola, which espoused a nationalist and traditionalist vision of Spain.</p><p>Ledesma Ramos's writings were marked by their polemical tone and their rejection of liberal democracy, Marxism, and other left-wing ideologies. He argued that only a strong, centralized state, guided by visionary leaders, could save Spain from its perceived decline and create a new era of prosperity and greatness.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Ledesma Ramos continues to be studied and debated by scholars of Spanish history and politics. His ideas and writings remain influential in far-right circles in Spain and elsewhere, and his vision of a strong, authoritarian state continues to resonate with those who seek to challenge the status quo.</p><p></p><p>

However, his political activities overshadowed his literary contributions, and his legacy is often associated with his controversial fascist ideologies.</p><p>Primo de Rivera's life was cut short when he was arrested by the Spanish Republican authorities in 1936, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. He was charged with attempting to overthrow the government and executed by firing squad in Alicante later that year. Despite his controversial legacy, Primo de Rivera remains a highly divisive figure in Spanish history, revered by some as a martyr and condemned by others as a fascist tyrant.</p><p>Primo de Rivera was the eldest son of Spanish military dictator, Miguel Primo de Rivera, and grew up in a privileged environment. He studied law at the Central University of Madrid and later joined the Spanish Conservative Party. However, he became disillusioned with traditional political parties and founded the Falange Española in 1933, which espoused fascist ideologies and aimed to create a one-party state in Spain. </p><p>Primo de Rivera was heavily influenced by the fascist movements in Italy and Germany and sought to modernize Spain's political system by introducing authoritarianism and nationalistic sentiments. His speeches often praised Spain's military past and emphasized the need for a strong government to restore order and unity in the country. </p><p>Despite his controversial political ideologies, Primo de Rivera had a strong following among young Spaniards who were disillusioned with the perceived inefficiencies of democracy. He was also a gifted orator and his speeches often drew large crowds. </p><p>Primo de Rivera's execution in 1936 marked the end of his political aspirations, but his legacy continued to impact Spanish politics for years to come. The Falange Española merged with other right-wing groups to form the Nationalist Party, which went on to win the Spanish Civil War in 1939, establishing a fascist dictatorship under General Francisco Franco. Although Primo de Rivera did not live to see his political goals realized, his fascist ideologies played a significant role in shaping Spain's political landscape during the early 20th century.</p><p>Primo de Rivera was not only involved in politics and literature but also had a passion for music. He was a skilled pianist and composer, and his music was heavily influenced by his political ideologies. Primo de Rivera believed that music could be used as a tool for propaganda and sought to promote fascist values through his compositions. One of his most famous works, "Himno de la Falange," became the official hymn of the Falange Española and was widely played during their rallies and meetings. Primo de Rivera's musical contributions continued to inspire fascist movements in Spain and other countries for years to come. In addition to his artistic pursuits, Primo de Rivera was also known for his personal life. He married his wife, Carmen Polo, in 1934 and they had four children together. Despite his political ambitions and controversial legacy, Primo de Rivera was known to be a devoted family man who loved spending time with his children.</p><p></p><p>
