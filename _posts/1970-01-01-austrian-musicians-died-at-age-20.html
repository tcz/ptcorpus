					</p><p>He was the son of famed composer and conductor, Joseph Lanner. Like his father, Augustin also became a prominent composer of dance music, particularly polkas and waltzes. He was considered to be a child prodigy and began composing at a young age, often collaborating with his father. </p><p>Augustin Lanner's most famous work is probably his "Die Schönbrunner," a piece of dance music named after the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna. He continued his father's legacy of composing music for the famous Viennese balls, and his compositions were often played at these events. </p><p>Unfortunately, Lanner's career was cut short by his untimely death at the age of 20. He died of tuberculosis, which was a common cause of death at the time.

He often performed with his father's orchestra and was well-known for his virtuosic playing. His talents as a composer and musician were acknowledged by important figures of his time, including Johann Strauss Sr. and Jr. who considered him to be a talented rising star. In fact, Augustin was supposed to take over his father's orchestra after his death; however, his own life was cut short before he could fulfill this role. Despite his short career, his influence on Viennese music was significant, and his compositions continue to be performed and enjoyed to this day.</p><p>Augustin Lanner was born into a family of musicians and learned to play several instruments during his childhood, including the piano and the violin. His father recognized his talent early on and began training him in music composition and arranging.

He was a popular figure among his contemporaries, and his premature death was mourned by many. His death also had an impact on Viennese music, with some experts speculating that he could have become a leading composer had he lived longer.</p><p>Augustin Lanner's music continues to be performed and recorded by modern-day musicians. His legacy is particularly important in the world of dance music, where his works continue to be played at ballroom events and festivals around the world.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Augustin Lanner's influence on Viennese music cannot be underestimated. His compositions were notable for their rich melodic content, and his use of harmony was considered innovative for his time. In particular, his use of brass instruments in polkas and waltzes added a new dimension to the dance music of the day. He was also credited with introducing certain musical themes and motifs that would become commonplace in Viennese music.</p><p>Augustin Lanner's works were often compared to those of his father, with some critics noting the similarities in style and composition. However, Augustin's music had a distinct character of its own, and his compositions were often considered more vigorous and exuberant than his father's.</p><p>In addition to composing dance music, Augustin Lanner also wrote music for operas and orchestras. Some of his most notable works in this genre include the overtures to his operas "Das Schlittenrennen" and "Das Mädchen am See." Despite his short life, Augustin Lanner left behind a substantial body of work that continues to inspire musicians and lovers of classical music around the world.</p><p>There are also reports that Augustin Lanner was an excellent painter, and that he often spent his free time sketching and drawing.
