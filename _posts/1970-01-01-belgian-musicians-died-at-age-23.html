In his short but prolific career, Kevorkian wrote poetry, plays, and literary criticisms, and published several works in French and Armenian. He was heavily influenced by Symbolism and Decadence, and his works often explored themes of love, tragedy, and the human condition.

Despite his short life, he left a lasting impact on the Belgian literary scene and is remembered as a significant figure in Armenian literature as well.</p><p></p><p>
