(September 25, 1877		Guaymas-October 19, 1945			Mexico City)

	
		otherwise known as Plutarco Elias Calles

	
was
a Mexican
politician.


					</p><p>He served as the President of Mexico from 1924 to 1928 and is often credited with being a founder of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). Calles was also a major figure in the Mexican Revolution, leading the northern revolutionary forces and establishing himself as a powerful political figure during the post-revolutionary period. He implemented many significant reforms during his presidency, including the creation of Mexico's central bank and the establishment of the Mexican Social Security Institute. Calles was also known for his anti-clerical policies, which led to the Cristero War, a violent conflict between the government and the Catholic Church in Mexico. After leaving office, Calles remained an influential political figure and continued to shape Mexican politics until his death in 1945.</p><p>During his early political career, Calles served as a governor of the Mexican state of Sonora and later as the Secretary of the Interior under President Álvaro Obregón. As president, Calles instituted several reforms that improved living conditions for poor, rural Mexicans, such as land redistribution and the creation of communal farming organizations. He also modernized Mexico's infrastructure, including the construction of new highways and railroads.</p><p>Calles' anti-clerical policies were a source of controversy throughout his presidency. In an effort to diminish the power of the Catholic Church, he enforced strict laws regulating the activities of priests and religious organizations. This led to a violent and bloody conflict with Catholic rebels who opposed the government's policies.</p><p>Despite his contributions to Mexican politics and society, Calles faced criticism for his authoritarian style of governing and his intolerance for dissent. He was eventually forced out of office in 1928 and went into exile in the United States, where he continued to exert influence on Mexican politics from afar.</p><p>Today, Calles is remembered as a complex and controversial figure in Mexican history, whose legacy continues to be debated by historians and political analysts.</p><p>Calles was also instrumental in the formation of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (PNR) in 1929, which eventually evolved into the PRI, the dominant political party in Mexico for much of the 20th century. Calles' pragmatic approach to politics and his willingness to work with diverse factions within the party helped establish the PRI as a broad-based coalition that could win elections and govern effectively. </p><p>In addition to his political achievements, Calles was also a successful businessman, owning several profitable companies that operated in the mining and agriculture sectors. He was a proponent of economic nationalism, advocating for the protection of domestic industries and the development of Mexico's domestic market. </p><p>Calles' legacy has been the subject of much debate in Mexico, with some seeing him as a reformer who brought much-needed changes to the country and others viewing him as an autocrat who stifled dissent and violated human rights. Despite these differing opinions, it is clear that Calles played a critical role in shaping modern Mexico and had a lasting impact on the country's political, economic, and social development.</p><p></p><p>
