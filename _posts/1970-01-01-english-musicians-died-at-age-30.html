(October 20, 1974		Leeds-July 7, 2005			London)

	
		also known as Mohammed Sadiq, Mohammed Sadiq Khan, Muhammad Sadiq Khan or Mohammed Sidique Khan

	
was
an English
personality.


					</p><p>He gained notoriety for being one of the four Islamist suicide bombers who carried out the 7/7 terrorist attacks in London in 2005. Khan was born in Leeds to immigrant parents from Pakistan and was raised as a Muslim. He worked as a teaching assistant before joining the terror group al-Qaeda.</p><p>Prior to the 7/7 attacks, Khan had visited Pakistan, where he received training in explosives, and had connections with known terrorists. His role in the attacks involved traveling to London with his accomplices and detonating a bomb on a train at Edgware Road station. The attack led to the deaths of 52 people and injured hundreds more.</p><p>After the attacks, Khan was identified through his remains found at the site of the explosion. A video message he had recorded before the attacks was later released by al-Qaeda, in which he stated his desire for revenge against the UK for their involvement in foreign conflicts, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan. The attacks marked a turning point in the UK's fight against terrorism, and led to increased security measures and legislation.</p><p>Khan's actions have been condemned by both the Muslim community and non-Muslims in the UK and around the world. While some have attempted to rationalize his actions as a result of discrimination and marginalization faced by Muslim communities, many have labeled Khan and his accomplices as terrorists who caused senseless violence and loss of life.Khan's upbringing and education have been scrutinized by officials and experts in an attempt to understand how he became involved in extremist ideologies. However, the exact reasons for his radicalization remain unclear. Despite the tragedy, Khan's family members have spoken publicly about their grief and condemnation of his actions. Khan's legacy will always be of a man who committed one of the deadliest acts of terrorism in UK history.</p><p>Khan's radicalization began in his early twenties, as he became involved in Muslim extremist groups and began attending radical mosques. He was known for being charismatic and a skilled communicator, which made him an effective recruiter for al-Qaeda. Khan's wife, Hasina Patel, was also involved in extremist activities and was arrested after the attacks for her role in the plot.Khan's involvement in the attacks was a shock to his family and friends, who described him as a quiet and friendly individual. Many in the UK Muslim community were quick to denounce his actions, stating that they did not represent the vast majority of Muslims in the country. The attacks also prompted a national conversation about the risks of radicalization and the importance of monitoring extremist groups and individuals.Khan's legacy has been complicated by the fact that he was born and raised in the UK, and his actions have been seen as a betrayal of his country and fellow citizens. However, his story has also been seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of extremist ideologies and the importance of effective counter-terrorism measures.</p><p></p><p>

(July 30, 1818		Thornton, West Yorkshire-December 19, 1848			Haworth)

	
		also known as Emily Jane Brontë, Ellis Bell, Emily Jane Bronte, Emily Bronté or Emily Bronte

	
was
an English
writer, novelist, poet and governess.


					</p><p>Despite her short life, Emily Brontë is considered one of the most important literary figures of the 19th century. She is best known for her novel "Wuthering Heights", which has become a classic of English literature. The book was initially met with mixed reviews due to its controversial themes, including obsessive love, revenge, and cruelty. However, it has since garnered critical acclaim and is regarded as a masterpiece of Gothic fiction.</p><p>Aside from her novel, Brontë was also a talented poet. She wrote over 200 poems during her lifetime, many of which were published posthumously. Her poetry was characterized by its intense emotions, natural imagery, and exploration of the human psyche.</p><p>Brontë's life was marked by tragedy and hardship. She grew up in a troubled family, with a father who was an alcoholic and an abusive brother. Despite these difficulties, she was highly educated and worked as a governess for several years before dedicating herself to writing. Her reclusive personality and fiercely independent spirit have contributed to her lasting mystique as a literary figure.</p><p>Brontë, alongside her sisters Charlotte and Anne, was part of a literary family. Her sisters also became renowned writers, with Charlotte writing "Jane Eyre", and Anne writing "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall". Emily and her sisters initially published their works under male pseudonyms due to the societal prejudices against female authors.</p><p>Brontë was known for her love of nature and the outdoors, which is evident in her writing. She spent much of her time exploring the moors surrounding her home in Haworth. Her love of nature is thought to have influenced her writing, particularly in "Wuthering Heights" where the moors are a prominent backdrop.</p><p>Despite her literary success, Brontë was uninterested in fame or public attention. She is known to have only left her hometown a handful of times in her life. Brontë's legacy continues to inspire writers and readers around the world, with her writing admired for its depth, complexity, and powerful portrayal of human emotions.</p><p>Brontë's passion for writing began at an early age, and she wrote many poems and stories throughout her life. It is said that she would often retreat to the family's dining room table to write, with her beloved dog Keeper by her side. Her writing style was unique for its time, as it was marked by its dark and brooding nature, often exploring taboo subjects and examining the darker aspects of humanity.</p><p>Despite her talent, little is known about Brontë's personal life. Many of her personal letters and manuscripts were destroyed by her sister, Charlotte, after her death. However, her legacy as a writer has continued to grow in the years since her passing. "Wuthering Heights" has been adapted into numerous films, television shows, and stage productions, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest works of English literature. </p><p>Brontë's influence can also be seen in the works of other famous writers, including Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf. Her contributions to literature have had a lasting impact on feminist thought and the study of literary realism.</p><p>Today, visitors can visit the Brontë Parsonage Museum in Haworth, which was the family's home for many years. The museum houses a collection of Brontë family artifacts, including manuscripts, letters, and personal items. It is a popular destination for fans of Brontë's work who are interested in learning more about her life and legacy.</p><p></p><p>
