was
an Israeli
lawyer, journalist, civil servant and politician.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Zsuzsi Kastner.

						</p><p>Rudolf Kastner was a controversial figure due to his role in negotiating with Nazi officials during World War II in order to save the lives of Hungarian Jews. He was accused of collaborating with the Nazis and not doing enough to save more Jews from deportation to concentration camps. However, some have argued that his negotiations with the Nazis saved thousands of lives and that he should be remembered as a hero. </p><p>After the war, Kastner moved to Israel and became a public figure, but his past actions continued to be a source of controversy. In 1953, he was sued for libel by Malchiel Gruenwald, a Holocaust survivor who accused Kastner of collaborating with the Nazis. The trial, known as the Kastner trial, became a national scandal and divided Israeli society. In 1957, Kastner was assassinated by a right-wing extremist who believed that he had betrayed the Jewish people during the war. </p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, Kastner remains a fascinating and complex figure in Jewish history, whose actions and decisions continue to be debated and analyzed by historians and scholars to this day.</p><p>Kastner was born in a Jewish family in Cluj-Napoca, Transylvania, which was then part of Hungary. He studied law and became a lawyer, but he also worked as a journalist and a civil servant. In 1943, when the Nazis invaded Hungary and began deporting Jews to concentration camps, Kastner became a leader of a Jewish rescue committee that tried to negotiate with the Nazis to save Hungarian Jews.</p><p>Kastner's negotiations with Adolf Eichmann, a high-ranking Nazi official, led to the rescue of over 1,700 Jews who were allowed to leave Hungary on a train to Switzerland. However, Kastner was criticized for not doing more to save more Jews and for allegedly cooperating with the Nazis by selecting certain Jews for rescue while ignoring others.</p><p>After the war, Kastner emigrated to Israel and became a spokesman for the Ministry of Trade and Industry. He also became involved in politics and joined the ruling Mapai Party. However, his past actions continued to haunt him, and he was sued for libel by a Holocaust survivor who accused him of collaborating with the Nazis. The trial became a national scandal and divided Israeli society.</p><p>Kastner's assassination in 1957 was a shocking event that highlighted the tension and violence in Israeli politics at the time. His legacy remains controversial, but he is remembered as a complex and flawed figure who tried to save as many Jews as he could during one of the darkest periods in Jewish history.</p><p>Kastner's assassination had a profound impact on Israeli society and led to a national conversation about the role of collaboration and responsibility during the Holocaust. Some viewed Kastner as a martyr who was killed for his efforts to save Jews, while others believed he deserved to be held accountable for his actions during the war. In recent years, Kastner's legacy has continued to be a subject of debate and scrutiny, with new evidence and perspectives emerging about his negotiations with the Nazis and the extent of his collaboration. Despite the controversies surrounding his life, Kastner's story remains a powerful reminder of the challenges and complexities of living through one of the darkest periods in human history.</p><p>Kastner's assassination in 1957 was a shocking event that highlighted the tension and violence in Israeli politics at the time.
