									</h1><p>Here are 7 famous musicians from Austria died at 49:</p><h2>Christian Doppler</h2><p><strong>Christian Doppler</strong>
(November 29, 1803		Salzburg-March 17, 1853			Venice)

	
		also known as Christian Andreas Doppler

	
was
an Austrian
physicist, scientist and mathematician.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Matilda Doppler, Ludwig Doppler, Adolf Doppler, Bertha Doppler and Hermann Doppler.

						</p><p>Doppler is best known for his discovery of what is now called the "Doppler effect" or "Doppler shift". This effect describes the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. Doppler's work on this phenomenon had a major impact on the fields of astronomy, meteorology, and physics, and is still studied today.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to the study of waves, Doppler was also interested in mathematics and astronomy. He published a number of papers on these topics throughout his career, including a theory on the origin of comets and a paper on the orbit of Bessel's star.</p><p>After completing his education, Doppler worked as a professor of mathematics and physics at the Polytechnic Institute in Vienna. He later became the director of the Physical Institute at the University of Prague. Doppler's legacy lives on through the many scientific concepts that bear his name, as well as through the ongoing work of researchers in his field.</p><p>Doppler's groundbreaking work on the Doppler effect inspired further research into the behavior of waves, leading to new discoveries in fields such as acoustics, geology, and medicine. The Doppler effect is now widely used in the fields of sound engineering, radar technology, and medical imaging, among others.</p><p>In addition to his scientific accomplishments, Doppler was a devoted family man and a devout Catholic. He married his wife, Mathilde Sturm, in 1836, and together they had five children. Despite his busy career, Doppler remained committed to his faith and attended mass regularly.</p><p>Today, Doppler is widely recognized as one of the most influential physicists of the 19th century. His work helped to shape our understanding of the behavior of waves and has had a lasting impact on fields ranging from astronomy to medicine. Despite his untimely death at the age of 49, Doppler's legacy continues to inspire scientists around the world to this day.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of respiratory disease.

was
an Austrian
conductor.


					</p><p>Kabasta began his career as a conductor in 1921 and quickly gained recognition for his interpretations of the works of Gustav Mahler. He served as the principal conductor of the Vienna Symphony Orchestra from 1938 to 1945, and during his tenure, he conducted many world premieres of works by contemporary Austrian composers. In addition, he was also known for his interpretations of the works of Richard Strauss and Anton Bruckner. Kabasta's conducting style was known for its intense emotional depth and his ability to bring out the nuances of a composition. Despite his successes as a conductor, Kabasta struggled with depression and eventually took his own life in 1946.</p><p>Kabasta was born in Vienna, Austria, to a family of musicians. His father was a chorister and his mother was a pianist. At the age of 19, Kabasta began his studies at the Vienna Conservatory and later became a pupil of the renowned conductor Felix Weingartner. He conducted his first concert in 1921 and soon gained a reputation as an exceptional conductor of Mahler's works. In addition to his work with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, Kabasta conducted the Berlin Philharmonic, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, and the London Philharmonic. </p><p>Kabasta was known for his exacting approach to rehearsal and his attention to detail. He was often described as demanding but fair by those who worked with him. Despite the challenges he faced during his career, including being removed from his position as principal conductor of the Vienna Symphony Orchestra after World War II, Kabasta's legacy as a conductor has endured. Today, he is regarded as one of the great conductors of the 20th century, and his recordings of Mahler's symphonies and other works continue to be highly regarded by music historians and enthusiasts alike.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of suicide.

an Austrian
psychologist.


					</p><p>She is best known for her contributions to authoritarian personality theory, which she developed alongside Theodor Adorno, Nevitt Sanford, and Daniel Levinson. Frenkel-Brunswik fled Nazi-occupied Austria with her husband and children in 1938, and settled in the United States where she continued her academic work.

In the United States, she held academic positions at the University of California, Berkeley and later at the University of California, Los Angeles, where she was a professor of psychology until her death in 1958.</p><p>Frenkel-Brunswik’s research on the authoritarian personality shed light on the psychological characteristics of individuals who are drawn to authoritarian leaders and systems, and helped explain the appeal of authoritarianism in the aftermath of World War II. She also conducted research on the effects of social change and industrialization on family dynamics, and was a pioneer in the study of child development and attachment.</p><p>In addition to her academic work, Frenkel-Brunswik was also an advocate for refugee and immigrant rights. She worked closely with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the International Refugee Organization to provide support for displaced persons and refugees following World War II.</p><p>Despite her many contributions to the field of psychology and social justice, Frenkel-Brunswik’s work has often been overshadowed by that of her male colleagues. However, her groundbreaking research on the authoritarian personality continues to be widely cited and has had a lasting impact on the understanding of prejudice and discrimination.</p><p></p><p>
