(January 3, 1893		Paris-March 15, 1945			Paris)

	
		also known as Drieu La Rochelle or Pierre Eugène Drieu La Rochelle

	
was
a French
writer and novelist.


					</p><p>Drieu La Rochelle was a prominent figure in the French literary and intellectual circles of the 1930s. He began his career as a journalist and later became a member of the French Communist Party. However, he was expelled from the party in 1927 due to his disagreement with the party's policies.</p><p>In his literary works, Drieu La Rochelle explored themes such as extreme political ideologies, the loss of faith in traditional values, and the human condition in times of crisis. He was known for his controversial views on fascism and anti-Semitism, which he expressed both in his works and in his personal life.</p><p>During World War II, Drieu La Rochelle initially supported the Vichy regime, but later became disillusioned and joined the French Resistance. However, his past affiliations with fascist and anti-Semitic groups made it difficult for him to gain the trust of his fellow resistance members.</p><p>Drieu La Rochelle's suicide in 1945, shortly after the end of the war, has been interpreted as a sign of his despair over the defeat of fascism and his inability to find a meaningful role in post-war France. Despite his controversial beliefs, his literary works have continued to be widely read and studied, and he remains a significant figure in the history of French literature.</p><p>Drieu La Rochelle was born into a wealthy family and attended prestigious schools, including the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. He served in World War I, which had a profound impact on him and influenced much of his writing. After the war, he worked as a journalist for various publications, including the socialist newspaper L'Humanité.</p><p>In addition to his novels and short stories, Drieu La Rochelle wrote essays and political tracts on topics such as fascism, nationalism, and the decline of Western civilization. He was connected to fascist and anti-Semitic groups in France, such as the Cagoule and the Action Française, although he was never a member of the Nazi party.</p><p>Despite his controversial beliefs, Drieu La Rochelle maintained close friendships with many prominent writers and artists of his time, including André Gide, Jean Cocteau, and Salvador Dalí.</p><p>Drieu La Rochelle's most famous works include "Gilles" (1939), a novel about a disillusioned World War I veteran who becomes involved in fascist politics, and "Socialisme Fasciste" (1934), a political manifesto in which he espoused his views on a fascist-style government.</p><p>Today, Drieu La Rochelle's legacy is debated by scholars and readers alike. While some view him as a brilliant and innovative writer, others criticize him for his controversial beliefs and association with fascist groups.</p><p>In addition to his literary and political pursuits, Drieu La Rochelle also had a turbulent personal life. He was married three times and had numerous affairs, including a scandalous relationship with writer and actress Louise Brooks. He struggled with depression and alcoholism throughout much of his life, and his mental health issues may have contributed to his fascination with fascism and his ultimate suicide. Despite his controversial views on race and politics, Drieu La Rochelle's writing is admired for its stylistic innovation and its exploration of the psychological and emotional toll of war and political upheaval.</p><p>Drieu La Rochelle's suicide was not his first attempt, as he had previously attempted suicide in 1935. His mental health struggles were a recurring theme in his writing, and he often explored the relationship between psychological trauma and political ideology in his works. Some modern-day scholars have suggested that Drieu La Rochelle's attraction to fascism was a form of escapism from his own demons. Moreover, some have argued that his controversial beliefs were a result of his desire to shock and provoke rather than any genuine ideological conviction. Despite his troubled life, Drieu La Rochelle's contributions to French literature and political thought are still studied and debated to this day, and his legacy remains a complex and controversial subject.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of suicide.

He was a patron of literature and the arts, and counted several prominent writers and artists among his circle of friends. Saliceti was particularly close to the poet and playwright Jean-François de La Harpe, and helped to fund his literary ventures.</p><p>Despite his successes in politics and science, Saliceti struggled with ill health throughout his life. He suffered from chronic pain and fatigue, and was frequently forced to take extended periods of rest. Nevertheless, he remained devoted to his work until the end of his life, and continued to play an important role in French politics and society in the years leading up to his death.</p><p>After his political career ended, Saliceti devoted himself to academic pursuits. He served as a professor of mathematics at the École Polytechnique, where he continued to publish important research in the fields of geometry and astronomy. Saliceti's groundbreaking work on the mathematics of optics helped lay the foundation for the development of modern optics and the study of light.</p><p>Saliceti was also a dedicated philanthropist, and used his wealth and influence to support charitable causes throughout his life. He funded the construction of hospitals and schools, and provided financial assistance to struggling artists and writers.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Saliceti is perhaps best remembered for his enduring friendship with Napoleon. The two men had a close personal relationship that was characterized by mutual respect and admiration. Saliceti embraced Napoleon's vision for a modern, progressive France, and worked tirelessly to help bring about the emperor's reforms.</p><p>Today, Saliceti is regarded as one of the most important and influential figures of the French Revolution. His contributions to mathematics, science, and politics helped shape the course of French history and contributed to the development of modern Europe. Despite his many achievements, however, Saliceti remained humble and dedicated to the causes he believed in, and his legacy continues to inspire scholars and activists around the world.</p><p>Antoine Christophe Saliceti was born in Saliceto, a village in the mountainous region of Corsica, which was then an Italian island under Genoese control but now a region of France. Saliceti showed prodigious intellectual talent from an early age, and after completing his legal studies, he began practicing law in Bastia, a city on the northeastern coast of Corsica. He quickly rose to prominence as a lawyer and became involved in local politics. In 1789, he became a member of the Corsican Assembly, a revolutionary government formed to resist French annexation of the island.</p><p>Saliceti was a fervent supporter of French revolutionary ideals, and he played a key role in the Corsican Revolution, which sought to establish Corsican independence and republicanism. He quickly rose through the ranks of the revolutionary government and was appointed to the Committee of Public Safety, which was responsible for overseeing the government's response to internal and external threats.</p><p>Saliceti's involvement in the French Revolution brought him into contact with Napoleon Bonaparte, who was then a young artillery officer serving in Corsica. The two men quickly formed a close friendship, based on shared interests in politics, science, and the arts.</p><p>Saliceti's intellectual pursuits extended beyond law and politics. He was a skilled mathematician and astronomer, and he published several important works on geometry, optics, and astronomy. His work on the calculus of variations helped lay the foundation for the modern study of calculus, and his research on the aberrations of light helped improve the accuracy of telescope lenses.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Saliceti's political career suffered several setbacks. In 1794, he was arrested and imprisoned during the Thermidorian Reaction, a period of political upheaval and repression that followed the fall of Robespierre and the end of the Reign of Terror. He was released from prison a year later but was exiled from France.</p><p>Upon his return to France in 1800, Saliceti resumed his political career, and he became one of Napoleon's most trusted advisors. He served as Napoleon's emissary to the Kingdom of Naples, where he played a key role in negotiating a peace treaty with the Neapolitan government. However, his relationship with Napoleon began to sour, and he retired from politics in 1808.</p><p>Saliceti died the following year, at the age of 52. He was remembered by his contemporaries as a brilliant intellect, a powerful orator, and a passionate advocate for political and social reform. Today, he is regarded as one of the most important thinkers and statesmen of the French Revolution, and his contributions to mathematics, science, politics, and the arts continue to inspire scholars and students around the world.</p><p></p><p>
