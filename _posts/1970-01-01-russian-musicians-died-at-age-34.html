					</p><p>Born in Mari El, Russia, Yvan Kyrlya was a talented artist from a young age. He began his career as an actor in various theatre productions before making his film debut in the 1933 movie "The Great Citizen". Kyrlya quickly gained recognition and became known for his notable performances in the films "Chapaev" (1934), "The Return of Maxim" (1937), and "Michurin" (1949). </p><p>Aside from his acting career, Kyrlya was also a gifted poet. He published several collections of his poems during his lifetime and was a member of the All-Union Writers' Union. </p><p>Tragically, Kyrlya's life was cut short when he was executed by the Nazis in 1943 during World War II. However, his legacy lived on and he posthumously received various awards including the Stalin Prize in 1946 for his contribution to the Soviet film industry. Today, he is remembered as one of Russia's greatest actors and poets.</p><p>In addition to his successful career as an actor, Yvan Kyrlya was known for his activism in promoting the arts. He was a member of the organizing committee for the 1st All-Union Conference of Partisan and Underground Writers, which took place in Moscow in April 1942. Kyrlya was also involved in the publication of the underground literary journal "Trudovaya Moskva", which aimed to provide a platform for writers who were banned from publishing by Soviet authorities. Despite the risks associated with these activities, Kyrlya continued to advocate for artistic freedom until his untimely death. He remains a symbol of courage and artistic integrity in the face of adversity.</p><p>Throughout his short but prolific career, Yvan Kyrlya managed to capture the hearts of audiences with his nuanced performances and elegant poetry. He was renowned for his ability to convey complex emotions with ease, and his work often touched on themes such as love, loss, and the struggle for freedom. Kyrlya was also deeply committed to promoting the Russian language and culture, and he was a staunch defender of the rights of artists to create and express themselves freely. Despite the challenges he faced during his lifetime, Kyrlya's art and activism continue to inspire generations of artists and thinkers to this day. In recognition of his outstanding contributions to Russian culture, a museum was established in his hometown of Mari El in 2001.</p><p>The Yvan Kyrlya Museum of Literature, Art, and History showcases items from Kyrlya's life, including his personal belongings, manuscripts, and memorabilia from his career in theater and film. The museum also features exhibitions on the history of the Mari El Republic, as well as educational programs for children and adults. In addition, the Yvan Kyrlya Literary Prize was established in 1994 to recognize outstanding contributions to modern Russian poetry. The prize is awarded annually to poets whose work embodies the spirit and ideals of Yvan Kyrlya's art and activism. Yvan Kyrlya's legacy continues to inspire and influence artists and thinkers not only in Russia but around the world.</p><p>Despite his political activism, Yvan Kyrlya was still able to maintain a successful career as an actor. His talent for bringing depth and emotion to his characters was recognized not only in his home country, but also internationally. He won the Best Actor award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia in 1946 for his performance in the film "Kuban Cossacks". His charm, charisma, and striking presence on screen ensured that he remained a beloved figure in Russian cinema long after his death.</p><p>In addition to his work in film and poetry, Kyrlya was also a passionate advocate for education. He believed that access to education was essential for the advancement of society and was actively involved in the establishment of schools in his native Mari El. He also supported educational initiatives aimed at promoting the Russian language and culture both nationally and internationally. His dedication to education earned him the title of Honored Teacher of the Mari El Republic in 1939.</p><p>Yvan Kyrlya's tragic death at the hands of the Nazis undoubtedly cut short his contributions to Russian culture and society. However, his legacy as an actor, poet, and activist lives on, continuing to inspire and influence generations of artists and thinkers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
