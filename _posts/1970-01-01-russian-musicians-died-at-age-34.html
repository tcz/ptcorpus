					</p><p>Born in Mari El, Russia, Yvan Kyrlya was a talented artist from a young age. He began his career as an actor in various theatre productions before making his film debut in the 1933 movie "The Great Citizen". Kyrlya quickly gained recognition and became known for his notable performances in the films "Chapaev" (1934), "The Return of Maxim" (1937), and "Michurin" (1949). </p><p>Aside from his acting career, Kyrlya was also a gifted poet.

Today, he is remembered as one of Russia's greatest actors and poets.</p><p></p><p>
