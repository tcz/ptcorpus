(June 27, 1898-September 19, 1954)

	
		also known as Tibor Harsanyi or Harsányi, Tibor

	
was
a Hungarian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a composer, conductor, and musicologist, known for his contributions to the development of early 20th century Hungarian music. Harsányi studied music in Budapest and Vienna before moving to Paris in the 1920s, where he became part of the city's thriving cultural scene. He was associated with the group of Hungarian composers known as "Les Six Hongrois", which included Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály. Harsányi was particularly interested in exploring the intersection of Hungarian folk music with classical music, and his compositions often incorporate elements of both. He also wrote extensively about music, and served as music critic for several Hungarian and French publications. Harsanyi's work had a significant impact on the development of music in Hungary and beyond.</p><p>In addition to his musical pursuits, Harsányi was also a political activist, involved in left-wing and anti-fascist movements throughout his life. During World War II, he was forced to flee France and spent time in the United States before returning to Paris in 1946. Harsányi also had a close friendship with the famed writer and philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre. His notable works include the ballet, "Le Baruffe Chiozzotte," and the opera, "Le Cœur de la Méduse." Harsányi died in Paris in 1954, at the age of 56, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering figure in Hungarian music and culture.</p><p>Harsányi was born into a Jewish family in Budapest. He grew up in a household that valued education and culture, and he began studying music at a young age. As a teenager, he showed great promise as a pianist and composer, and he went on to study at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest. He also studied composition in Vienna with Franz Schreker, a prominent Austrian composer.</p><p>After moving to Paris in the 1920s, Harsányi quickly became involved in the city's vibrant artistic and intellectual circles. He was a regular attendee of the famous salons hosted by Gertrude Stein, and he counted many prominent artists and writers among his friends, including Pablo Picasso, James Joyce, and Samuel Beckett.</p><p>Despite his success abroad, Harsányi never forgot his Hungarian roots, and he remained committed to exploring the ways in which Hungarian folk music could be incorporated into classical compositions. He was also deeply committed to political activism, and he used his music and writing to advocate for social justice and the rights of marginalized communities.</p><p>Today, Harsányi is widely regarded as one of the most important Hungarian composers of the 20th century, and his work continues to be performed and celebrated around the world.</p><p>Harsányi's political activism also led him to become involved in the anti-fascist movement in France during World War II. As a result, he was forced to flee the country and sought refuge in the United States. During his time in the US, he taught at several universities and composed music for films before returning to Paris in 1946.</p><p>In addition to his work as a composer and music critic, Harsányi was also an accomplished conductor. He led several orchestras, including the Hungarian Opera House Orchestra, and was known for his innovative interpretations of classical works.</p><p>Harsányi's contributions to Hungarian music were recognized during his lifetime, and he was awarded numerous honors and awards, including the Order of the Star of the Hungarian Republic. Today, his legacy continues to live on through his music, which is studied and performed by musicians around the world.</p><p>One notable aspect of Harsányi's compositional style was his use of polytonality, a technique in which multiple keys are played simultaneously. This was a departure from the prevailing compositional style of the time, which emphasized tonal harmony. Harsányi's use of polytonality gave his music a unique and experimental sound that set him apart from his peers.</p><p>Despite his successes, Harsányi's life was not without challenges. As a Jewish man living during the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe, he faced discrimination and persecution, and he was forced to flee his home several times. His experiences as an outsider in society informed his political views and his commitment to social justice.</p><p>Harsányi's contributions to music and culture in Hungary and beyond continue to be celebrated today. His innovative compositions and his advocacy for marginalized communities have left a lasting impact on the world of music and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
