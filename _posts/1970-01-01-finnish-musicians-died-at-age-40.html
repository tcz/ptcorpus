a Finnish
politician.


					</p><p>Elias Simojoki was best known as a prominent figure in Finnish politics during the interwar years. He was an active member of the Finnish parliament and played a significant role in advocating for socialist policies and workers' rights. In addition to his political career, Simojoki was also a prominent member of the Finnish clergy and was known for his efforts to reconcile left-wing politics with Christian teachings.</p><p>Tragically, Simojoki's life was cut short when he was arrested by Soviet authorities during the Winter War and later executed by firing squad in 1940. Despite his untimely death, he remains a respected and admired figure in Finnish history and his contributions to the country's political and religious landscape are still remembered and celebrated today.</p><p>Simojoki was born into a family of farmers in Rautio, a small village in central Finland.

He advocated for social justice and championed the rights of workers, often aligning himself with the socialist movement in Finland.</p><p>Alongside his religious and political work, Simojoki was also a prolific writer and journalist. He founded the left-wing newspaper Kansan Lehti in 1929 and used his platform to champion progressive causes such as women's rights, pacifism, and anti-fascism.</p><p>Simojoki's commitment to leftist politics put him at odds with the conservative government of the time, and he was frequently targeted by nationalist and fascist groups. During the Winter War, he was arrested by Soviet authorities for his outspoken criticism of the Soviet Union's actions in Finland. He was later executed by firing squad in 1940.</p><p>Despite his short life, Simojoki left a lasting legacy as a tireless advocate for social justice and a respected religious leader who sought to bring the principles of Christianity to bear on political issues. His work continues to inspire political and religious figures in Finland and beyond to this day.</p><p></p><p>
