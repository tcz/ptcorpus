(June 18, 1868-June 29, 1916)


was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>Georges Lacombe was a French painter, engraver, sculptor, and filmmaker. He was associated with the Symbolist movement and was known for his innovative use of color and form in his artworks. Lacombe studied under artists such as Gustave Moreau and Albert Besnard and was part of the Nabis group, which included artists such as Pierre Bonnard and Édouard Vuillard. In addition to his work in the visual arts, Lacombe was also a pioneering filmmaker, producing several short films that explored themes similar to those in his artwork. He died at the age of 48 due to a heart attack.</p><p>Lacombe's work often depicted landscapes, still lifes, and scenes from everyday life. His paintings were characterized by a dreamy, almost mystical quality, and he often used bold, expressive colors to convey emotion. Lacombe's sculptures were similarly expressive, with sinuous, flowing forms that reflected his interest in nature and the human form.</p><p>As a filmmaker, Lacombe experimented with new techniques and styles, producing films that were highly innovative for their time. His most famous work, "La Zone," was a silent film that depicted life in a poverty-stricken neighborhood in Paris. The film was notable for its use of naturalistic acting and its nuanced portrayal of the struggles of working-class people.</p><p>Despite his short career, Lacombe had a significant influence on the art world of his time. His work was exhibited widely during his lifetime, and he played a key role in the development of French art in the early 20th century. Today, he is remembered as one of the most innovative and visionary artists of his time.</p><p>Lacombe was also deeply influenced by Japanese art, which he discovered during a visit to an exhibition in Paris in 1890. This influence can be seen in his use of flattened forms and asymmetrical compositions. He also became interested in Japanese philosophy and spirituality and incorporated elements of these into his work. Lacombe was a member of the Salon d'Automne and the Salon des Indépendants, two important art exhibitions in Paris at the time.</p><p>In addition to his involvement in the art world, Lacombe was also politically active. He was a member of the anarchist movement and participated in protests and rallies. This activism is reflected in some of his artworks, which often addressed social and political issues of the time.</p><p>Despite his short life, Lacombe left behind a significant body of work that continues to inspire and influence artists today. His paintings, sculptures, and films are held in collections around the world, including at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Lacombe's pioneering spirit and dedication to innovation continue to make him an important figure in the history of art.</p><p></p><p>

(May 14, 1827		Valenciennes-October 12, 1875			Courbevoie)

	
		also known as Jean Baptiste Carpeaux

	
was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux was a popular sculptor and painter during the late 19th century. He studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and his early works were considered to be in the academic style. However, as his career progressed, he became more experimental and his works often featured movement and emotion.</p><p>Carpeaux's most famous works include the sculpture fountain at the Louvre, which depicts the four corners of the world, as well as his bronze bust of princess Mathilde Bonaparte. He was also known for his portraits, caricatures, and animal sculptures.</p><p>Unfortunately, Carpeaux's life was cut short by illness and he died at the relatively young age of 48. Despite this, his works had a lasting impact on French art and he is still celebrated as one of the country's most important sculptors.</p><p>Carpeaux began his career as an apprentice in a marble workshop and later received commissions for his work from the French government. He received recognition for his sculptures at the Salon de Paris and was eventually awarded the Legion of Honour. Through his art, Carpeaux attempted to capture the movement and vitality of life, rather than just a static representation. This style was influential in the development of the Impressionist movement in art. Some of his other notable works include the "Dance" sculpture, which was commissioned for the façade of the Paris Opera and depicts a group of dancers, and his "La Force" sculpture, which is housed in the Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon, France. Today, many of Carpeaux's works can be found in museums and public spaces throughout France, including the Musée d'Orsay and the Tuileries Garden.</p><p>Carpeaux had a reputation for being a passionate and charismatic individual, often drawing admiration from his peers and critics. He was inspired by the human form, which is evident in his lifelike sculptures, and he had a fondness for the Italian Renaissance style of art. Carpeaux was also influential in the education and training of young artists, serving as a teacher and mentor to many throughout his career. </p><p>Carpeaux's personal life was marked by tragedy, as his wife and daughter both died young. He also suffered from mental and physical health issues, including severe headaches and insomnia. Despite his personal struggles, Carpeaux remained dedicated to his art, producing some of his most famous works during his difficult times. </p><p>Today, Carpeaux's legacy lives on, with his works continuing to inspire and influence artists around the world. His innovative approach to sculpture and his ability to capture movement and emotion in his art have cemented his place as one of France's most important artists.</p><p></p><p>

						</p><p>Souvestre studied law in Rennes, but he soon realized that literature is his true calling. After moving to Paris, he started working on his writing career and became a highly acclaimed novelist. Souvestre's books were popular in his time and explored various themes such as social justice, education, and women's rights. He also wrote some historical works and travelogues. One of his most famous works is the utopian novel "The World As It Shall Be" (Le Monde tel qu'il sera), which anticipates the future with great precision. Souvestre was also a political activist and was involved in the French Socialist movement. His daughter, Marie, was also a prominent figure in French society, opening a progressive school for girls and influencing many important female figures of her time.</p><p>In addition to his successful career as a novelist and political activist, Émile Souvestre was also a prolific journalist. He contributed to several newspapers and journals, including Le National, Le Temps, and La Presse. Souvestre's journalism work covered a diverse range of topics, from literary criticism to political commentary. He also translated works from English, including those of Walter Scott and Lord Byron. Souvestre's writings often showcased his progressive and humanitarian views, which drew admiration and praise from many of his contemporaries.
