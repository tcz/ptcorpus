(September 11, 1917		Philadelphia-July 25, 1963)


was
an American
, .


						</p><p>John Adriano Acea was an American jazz pianist, composer, arranger, and bandleader. He was known for his contributions to the Latin jazz genre, but he also played swing and bebop. Acea began his career in the 1930s as a pianist for various big band groups, including those led by Chick Webb and Jimmie Lunceford. In the 1940s, he worked with famous Latin jazz musicians such as Machito and Tito Puente. He was also part of the house band at the famous Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York. As a bandleader, Acea recorded several albums in the 1950s, including "In Puerto Rico" and "Bongos, Bass and Guitar". He continued to perform and record until his death in 1963 at the age of 45.</p><p>Acea was born to Italian immigrants and raised in Philadelphia. He showed an early aptitude for music and began playing the piano at a young age. He studied music at Temple University and later joined the military during World War II, where he played in the Army Band. After the war, he returned to New York and continued to work as a musician. </p><p>Acea was known for his innovative arrangements and compositions. He incorporated elements of Afro-Caribbean and Latin music into his arrangements, which helped to create the Latin jazz sound. He was also a skilled pianist who could play in many different styles. </p><p>In addition to his work as a musician, Acea was a respected music educator. He taught at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music in New York and also taught private lessons. Many of his students went on to become successful musicians in their own right. </p><p>Despite his significant contributions to the world of jazz, Acea remains relatively unknown outside of jazz circles. His recordings are highly regarded by musicians and critics, but he never achieved the same level of commercial success as some of his contemporaries. Nevertheless, his influence can be heard in the work of many modern Latin jazz musicians.</p><p>Acea was not only a talented instrumentalist, but also a prolific composer. He wrote many original compositions, some of which became jazz standards. One of his most famous compositions is "Wild, Cool & Swingin'," which was recorded by the big band leader Count Basie. Acea also arranged and conducted for other musicians, including Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Ella Fitzgerald.</p><p>Throughout his career, Acea faced many challenges due to racial discrimination. As an Italian-American, he was sometimes not permitted to play in all-white bands, and as a person of color, he faced discrimination in the music industry. Despite these obstacles, he persevered and continued to make significant contributions to jazz.</p><p>Acea's legacy continues to inspire new generations of musicians. In 2012, his alma mater, Temple University, established the John Adriano Acea Jazz Piano Competition, which is held annually and awards a cash prize to the winner. Additionally, his recordings have been reissued and continue to be celebrated by jazz aficionados.</p><p></p><p>
