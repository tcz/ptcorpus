She appeared in over 70 films throughout her career, including "The Charlatan" (1929), "The Haunted House" (1929), and "The Case of the Velvet Claws" (1936). </p><p>In the early 1930s, Starke's career began to decline, and she retired from acting in 1935.

After Doheny's death in 1945, Starke remained active in social circles, but largely stayed out of the public eye. </p><p>Despite her relatively short career, Starke was a talented actor who had a significant influence on the film industry.
