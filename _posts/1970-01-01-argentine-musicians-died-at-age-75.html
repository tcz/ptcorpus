(February 18, 1800		Calamuchita Department-June 30, 1875			Buenos Aires)

	
		a.k.a. Dalmacio Velez Sarsfield

	
was
an Argentine
lawyer.


					</p><p>He studied at the University of Buenos Aires, and later in France, where he earned a doctorate in law. Vélez Sársfield served as a deputy in the Argentine legislature and was a key author of the Argentine Civil Code, which was adopted in 1869 and is still in use today. He also wrote several other legal works and was considered an expert in civil and commercial law. In addition to his legal career, Vélez Sársfield was involved in politics and was a strong advocate for federalism and constitutional government in Argentina. He is widely regarded as one of the most important legal figures in Argentine history.</p><p>Vélez Sársfield was born into a wealthy family and received a comprehensive education from his parents, who were both highly educated. His mother, Encarnación Sársfield, was a writer and poet, and his father, Clemente Vélez, was a military officer and politician. The family was forced to move to Buenos Aires during the Argentine War of Independence, where Vélez Sársfield attended the newly established University of Buenos Aires.</p><p>After completing his studies, Vélez Sársfield traveled to France to further his education. He studied at the Sorbonne and the College de France in Paris and earned his doctorate in law from the University of Paris. He returned to Buenos Aires in 1829 and began practicing law.</p><p>As a deputy in the Argentine legislature, Vélez Sársfield worked tirelessly on the Civil Code, which aimed to overhaul and unify the country's complex legal system. The new code brought together laws from Spain, Italy, and France and created a streamlined, modern legal system for the country. Vélez Sársfield's work on the code was widely praised, and it remains an important part of Argentine law to this day.</p><p>Vélez Sársfield also served as a judge and was known for his impartiality and dedication to justice. He was respected by both his peers and the public and became known as one of the most important legal figures in Argentine history. Vélez Sársfield passed away in Buenos Aires on June 30, 1875, but his legacy lives on as one of the architects of modern Argentina.</p><p>In addition to his work on the Civil Code, Vélez Sársfield wrote several other legal works, including a commentary on the Argentine Constitution, which was highly regarded. He was also involved in politics and was a strong advocate for federalism and constitutional government in Argentina. Vélez Sársfield believed that the country's future depended on the adoption of modern, liberal ideals and worked to promote these ideas in his work as a lawyer and politician.</p><p>Vélez Sársfield was also a respected member of Argentine society and was known for his philanthropy. He was involved in several charitable organizations, including the Sociedad de Beneficencia and the Sociedad de los Niños.</p><p>After his death, Vélez Sársfield was honored with numerous tributes and monuments, including a statue in Buenos Aires. His legacy as a legal scholar and advocate for justice and democracy continues to be celebrated in Argentina and beyond.</p><p>Vélez Sársfield's contributions to Argentine law and politics were not limited to his work on the Civil Code. He was also heavily involved in debates about slavery and abolitionism in the country. In 1833, he wrote a book called "Elementos de Derecho Civil" (Elements of Civil Law), in which he argued for the abolition of slavery. He believed that slavery was incompatible with the principles of a just society and that it hindered Argentina's progress. While his anti-slavery stance was not immediately successful, Vélez Sársfield's arguments helped to shift public opinion in favor of abolitionism.</p><p>Vélez Sársfield was not only respected within Argentina, but he also had an impact on legal and political thinking in other parts of Latin America. His Civil Code influenced legal reforms in other countries, including Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay. He was also a member of the Latin American Institute of Social Sciences, which brought together scholars from across the region to exchange ideas on issues such as democracy, human rights, and development.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Vélez Sársfield was not immune to criticism. Some of his contemporaries accused him of being too conservative and of favoring the interests of the wealthy elite. Others objected to his attempts to harmonize Argentine law with European legal systems, arguing that it ignored the country's unique cultural and historical context. However, Vélez Sársfield's legacy as an advocate for justice and democracy remains largely positive and continues to inspire legal scholars and political activists in Argentina and beyond.</p><p></p><p>

(February 24, 1936		Buenos Aires-November 29, 2011			Buenos Aires)

	
		also known as Guillermo Alberto O&#039;Donnell

	
was
an Argentine
political scientist.


					</p><p>O'Donnell was a leading expert on democratization in Latin America, and was particularly known for his work on "transitions to democracy," or the process of moving from authoritarian regimes to democratic governments. He served as a professor at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Buenos Aires, and was also a visiting professor at numerous other universities around the world. O'Donnell authored or co-authored several influential books, including "Transitions from Authoritarian Rule: Tentative Conclusions about Uncertain Democracies" and "Hard Choices: Security, Democracy, and Regionalism in Southeast Asia." In addition to his academic work, O'Donnell was involved in public policy, serving as an advisor to the Argentine government and the United Nations. He was widely respected for his contributions to the study of democracy and politics, both in Argentina and around the world.</p><p>Throughout his career, O'Donnell made several significant contributions to the field of political science. One of his major contributions was the concept of "delegative democracy." This theory suggests that in certain political systems, such as those prevalent in Latin America, elected leaders may act as strongmen or caudillos, rather than as representatives of the people. This can result in a democracy that is more authoritarian than truly democratic.</p><p>O'Donnell also emphasized the importance of civil society and social movements in bringing about democratic change. He argued that these groups can play a crucial role in pushing for government accountability and creating an environment in which democratic institutions can flourish.</p><p>In addition to his scholarly work, O'Donnell was known for his commitment to social justice and human rights. He was a vocal critic of the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983, and became an advocate for the families of those who disappeared during this time.</p><p>Overall, O'Donnell's prolific scholarship and dedication to democratic values have had a lasting impact on the field of political science and beyond.</p><p>O'Donnell received several honors for his work, including the prestigious Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences in 2008. He was also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Guggenheim Foundation. In recognition of his contributions to the study of democracy, the Latin American Studies Association established the Guillermo O'Donnell Democracy Award in his honor, which is awarded annually to individuals or organizations that have demonstrated a commitment to democratic values and practices in Latin America. O'Donnell's legacy continues to inspire scholars and activists in their efforts to promote democracy and social justice around the world.</p><p>O'Donnell was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on February 24, 1936. He earned his Ph.D. in Political Science from Yale University in 1965, where he studied under notable political scientist Juan Linz. After completing his studies, O'Donnell returned to Argentina, where he began to teach at the University of Buenos Aires. However, his involvement in left-wing politics led to his dismissal from the university in 1966, following a military coup in Argentina. </p><p>Forced to leave Argentina, O'Donnell spent several years teaching at universities in the United States, including the University of Chicago and the University of California, San Diego. During this time, he continued to be involved in political activism, speaking out against the military dictatorships that were prevalent in many Latin American countries.</p><p>In the late 1970s, O'Donnell returned to Argentina and became involved in the human rights movement, working to expose the atrocities committed by the Argentine military regime. He helped to found the Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (CELS), an organization dedicated to promoting human rights and legal reform in Argentina. </p><p>In addition to his academic work, O'Donnell was also involved in public policy, serving as an advisor to the Argentine government and the United Nations. He helped to develop policies and programs aimed at promoting democracy and social justice in the region.</p><p>Throughout his career, O'Donnell remained committed to advancing the cause of democracy and human rights, both in Latin America and around the world. His contributions to the study of democracy and politics have had a lasting impact on the field and continue to inform discussions and debates about democratic governance. O'Donnell died on November 29, 2011, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, after a battle with cancer.</p><p></p><p>
