(June 15, 1865		Nîmes-September 1, 1903			Paris)


was
a French
journalist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his lectures and writings on Jewish history and Zionism. Lazare was born to a Jewish family in Nîmes, France and was educated at the École normale israélite orientale in Paris. In his early years, he worked as a journalist and critic for various French newspapers and magazines. </p><p>He began to take an interest in Jewish history and culture, and in 1894, he became embroiled in the infamous Dreyfus Affair, a political scandal that involved the wrongful conviction of a Jewish French army officer, Alfred Dreyfus, on charges of treason. Lazare became one of Dreyfus's most vocal supporters and helped to expose the anti-Semitism that was rampant in the French government and military at the time. </p><p>He went on to write several books and articles on Jewish issues, including his most famous work, "Antisemitism: Its History and Causes," which was published in 1894. Lazare also became involved in the Zionist movement, which aimed to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. </p><p>Unfortunately, Lazare's life was cut short at the age of 38 due to tuberculosis. Despite his short life, he made a significant impact as a journalist, activist, and writer, and his work continues to be studied and celebrated by scholars and activists alike.</p><p>In addition to his work as a journalist and writer, Bernard Lazare was also a prominent figure in the French anarchist movement. He was a close friend and collaborator of the anarchist philosopher Sébastien Faure, and he wrote several articles on anarchism and political theory. Lazare's political views were shaped by his experiences as a Jew in France, and he saw anarchism as a means of resisting the oppressive structures of the state and capitalist society.</p><p>Lazare's interest in Jewish history and culture also led him to become involved in the study of Kabbalah, a mystical tradition within Judaism. He studied with the Kabbalist scholar Stanislas de Guaita and wrote several articles on Kabbalistic texts and ideas.</p><p>Despite his prominent role in the Dreyfus Affair and his support for Zionism, Lazare was critical of some aspects of the Zionist movement, particularly its exclusive focus on Palestine as the site for a Jewish homeland. He argued for a more universalist approach to Jewish identity and for greater recognition of the cultural diversity within Jewish communities.</p><p>Today, Lazare is remembered as a pioneering figure in the study of Jewish history and as a passionate advocate for justice and human rights.</p><p>His contributions to the exposure of anti-Semitism and advocacy for the Jewish people have earned him a place in the pantheon of Jewish and French intellectuals. Moreover, his writings on political theory, anarchism, and Kabbalah continue to inspire scholars across several disciplines. The Bernard Lazare Prize, an annual French literary award, is named in his honor.</p><p></p><p>

(June 24, 1755		Kleve-March 24, 1794			Paris)

	
		also known as Jean-Baptiste du Val-de-Grace, baron de Cloots

	
was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>Anacharsis Cloots was a significant figure during the French Revolution, known as "orator of the human race." He was a fervent supporter of the French Revolution and an active member of the Jacobin Club. Cloots was born in Kleve (now part of Germany) to a wealthy Prussian family and educated in theology, law, and philosophy in Paris. He was also fluent in several languages, including French, German, Dutch, English, and Italian.</p><p>Cloots was a firm believer in universal equality and the idea of a world without borders, which led him to join the revolutionaries and adopt the name "Anacharsis," after an ancient Greek philosopher who renounced his citizenship to become a citizen of the world. He actively campaigned for the abolition of monarchy and aristocracy, advocating for a global republic. In 1792, he became a member of the National Convention and even proposed a resolution to declare French the universal language.</p><p>However, despite his convictions, Cloots fell victim to the Reign of Terror, and in March 1794, he was arrested and accused of being a foreign spy. He was tried and found guilty and sentenced to death. On March 24, 1794, he was guillotined in Paris, becoming one of the many victims of the Terror. Despite his tragic end, his legacy as a visionary philosopher and advocate for human rights continues to live on.</p><p>Anacharsis Cloots was also known for his extravagant lifestyle and eccentricities. He dressed in flamboyant outfits, often riding through the streets of Paris on horseback while wearing Greek robes and carrying a scepter. He also threw lavish parties that were attended by many of the era's intellectual elite. In addition to his political writings, he published several works on religion, including "The Universal Religion," in which he argued for a new religion based on reason and science rather than dogma and tradition. His ideas on religion and the role of the state in promoting equality were highly influential in the years following his death, as Europe continued to grapple with the legacy of the French Revolution. Today, Anacharsis Cloots is recognised as one of the most important political thinkers of his time, and his ideas continue to inspire scholars and activists around the world.</p><p>Apart from his political and philosophical activities, Anacharsis Cloots was also involved in literary and theatrical circles in Paris during the 18th century. He was a member of the "Society of Thirty," which included many famous writers and thinkers such as Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Voltaire. Cloots also wrote plays, including "La Toile d'araignée" (The Spider's Web), which was performed at the Comédie-Française in 1791.</p><p>Cloots was a supporter of the idea of a federation of Europe, which would unite all the nations of the continent under a single government. He believed that this would promote peace, prosperity, and the free exchange of ideas and culture. Cloots also championed the cause of women's rights, advocating for equal opportunities and social justice for women.</p><p>Despite his talents and ideals, Anacharsis Cloots was ultimately unable to escape the violence and chaos of the French Revolution. His legacy, however, continues to inspire those who seek to build a more just and equitable world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by capital punishment.

He played a leading role in the purges of the Girondins, a group of moderate republicans who opposed the radicalization of the Revolution.</p><p>Despite his reputation as a ruthless ideologue, Couthon was also known for his advocacy on behalf of the poor and his efforts to improve the conditions of the working classes. He was a strong supporter of universal suffrage and believed in the redistribution of wealth as a means of promoting social justice.</p><p>Couthon's political career came to an abrupt end when he was arrested and sentenced to death during the fall of Robespierre, another key figure in the Reign of Terror. He died on the guillotine in 1794, along with many of his fellow revolutionaries.</p><p>As a child, Couthon suffered from a bone disease that left him permanently disabled and confined to a wheelchair.

He was also a driving force behind the establishment of a state religion, the Cult of the Supreme Being, that was intended to promote civic morality and virtue.</p><p>Despite his extreme views and actions, Couthon was seen by some as a benevolent figure who genuinely cared about the plight of the poor. He was also known for his close friendship with Robespierre, who considered him one of his most trusted confidants. </p><p>Couthon's legacy is one of both radicalism and compassion, and his role in shaping the course of the French Revolution continues to be studied and debated by historians today.</p><p>Couthon's involvement in the Reign of Terror was marked by his unwavering dedication to the revolutionary cause.

He was also instrumental in the establishment of the first system of public education in France, which he saw as a means of providing equal opportunities for all citizens.Couthon's physical disability never deterred him from his political ambitions, and he continued to work tirelessly on behalf of the Revolution until his arrest and execution. His life and career stand as a testament to the complexities of the French Revolution and the varied motivations and ideologies of those who participated in it.</p><p></p><p>
