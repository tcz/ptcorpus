(November 7, 1889		Gothenburg-December 25, 1945)


was
a Swedish
cartoonist.


					</p><p>He was best known for his popular comic strip "Adamson", which first appeared in the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter in 1935. The comic strip featured a lovable and bumbling character, Adamson, along with his mischievous dog, Rocky, and their many adventures. Jacobsson's unique cartooning style and humorous storytelling quickly gained a following, and "Adamson" became hugely popular throughout Sweden and beyond. Jacobsson also worked as a political cartoonist and illustrator, and his work appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines. Despite his success, Jacobsson struggled with alcohol addiction, and his health declined in the years leading up to his death. Nevertheless, his legacy as one of Sweden's most beloved cartoonists remains strong today.</p><p>In addition to "Adamson," Oscar Jacobsson was also known for creating the comic strip "Fina Familjen" (The Fine Family) in 1942, which revolved around the lives of a wealthy family and their household staff. He also illustrated several children's books and designed posters for the Swedish government during World War II. </p><p>Jacobsson was a member of the Swedish Academy of Comic Art and he was awarded the Prince Eugen Medal in 1945 for his contributions to Swedish culture. Additionally, the city of Gothenburg named a street after him in the late 1940s. </p><p>Despite his struggle with alcohol addiction, Jacobsson remained committed to his work, continuing to create cartoons and illustrations until his death on Christmas Day in 1945.</p><p>Jacobsson began his career as an artist in 1909 when he started working as a furniture painter. However, he soon realized his true passion lay in cartooning, and he began contributing political cartoons to various newspapers in Gothenburg. In 1925, Jacobsson moved to Stockholm to work for the newspaper Stockholms-Tidningen, where he created a number of successful comic strips. During World War II, Jacobsson's cartoons often had strong anti-Nazi sentiments, and he used his talents to support the Swedish resistance movement. </p><p>Despite his success, Jacobsson lived a relatively modest life, and his lifestyle was at odds with the wealthy characters he depicted in "Fina Familjen." He was known for his self-deprecating humor and humble nature, and he was greatly respected by his colleagues in the industry. </p><p>Today, Jacobsson's cartoons and illustrations are regarded as some of the most iconic examples of Swedish comic art. His influence can be seen in the work of later cartoonists, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of artists.</p><p></p><p>

His paintings often depict street scenes, landscapes, and still life, and he is especially known for his portraits of prominent figures of his time. Despite being recognized as one of the most important Swedish painters of the 20th century, Grünewald was not widely appreciated during his lifetime.

(July 8, 1892-January 11, 1949			Stockholm)


was
a Swedish
mathematician.


					</p><p>He is known for his work in complex analysis and the theory of functions of a complex variable. Carleman's contributions to the field include the Carleman formula and the Carleman-Bernstein-Totik theorem. </p><p>Born in Stockholm, Carleman studied at Uppsala University before receiving his doctorate in mathematics from Stockholm University in 1920. He went on to teach at Stockholm University and the Royal Institute of Technology. </p><p>In addition to his work in mathematics, Carleman was involved in the Resistance during World War II, serving as a courier and helping to smuggle Jewish refugees out of Norway. He was awarded the King's Medal for his efforts. </p><p>Carleman died in 1949 at the age of 56 from a heart attack. His contributions to mathematics continue to influence the field today.</p><p>Carleman's legacy also includes his development of the Carleman matrix, a mathematical construct used in the study of inverse problems. He was also among the first to apply complex analysis to the study of partial differential equations, an approach that has since become a powerful tool in the field. In addition to his academic work, Carleman was a member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences. He was recognized for his contributions to mathematics with numerous awards and honors, including the Fernström Prize, the Order of the Polar Star, and the Royal Society's Royal Medal. Today, Carleman is remembered not only for his groundbreaking work in mathematics, but also for his bravery and dedication to the Resistance during some of the darkest days of human history.</p><p>Carleman's contributions to complex analysis and the theory of functions of a complex variable were highly influential in the field. His Carleman formula, which relates the coefficients of a power series to the singularities of the corresponding function, is still widely used today. The Carleman-Bernstein-Totik theorem, which he co-discovered with Sergei Bernstein and Arne Beurling, is another important result in complex analysis that has been applied in a variety of contexts, from signal processing to mathematical physics.</p><p>Despite being highly active in the Resistance during World War II, Carleman managed to continue his mathematical work throughout this period. He published several important papers during the war, including a landmark paper on the theory of partial differential equations that laid the groundwork for much of modern research in this field.</p><p>Carleman's work has had a lasting impact on mathematics, with researchers continuing to build on his ideas to this day. Many of his theorems and formulae are still regarded as fundamental results in complex analysis and related fields. Beyond his contributions to mathematics, Carleman's bravery and dedication in the face of adversity continue to inspire people around the world.</p><p></p><p>
