(December 9, 1901		Rijeka-June 1, 1938			Paris)

	
		also known as Odon von Horvath, Ödön Horváth, Edmund Josef von Horváth, Ödön Horvath or Ödön von Horvath

	
was
a Hungarian
writer.


					</p><p>He was born in present-day Croatia but his family relocated to Hungary when he was young. Horváth wrote plays, novels and short stories, and his work is known for its critical examination of the societal trends of his time. He is considered to be one of the most important literary figures of the interwar period in Central Europe, and his works are still widely read and performed today. Some of his most famous works include the plays "Tales from the Vienna Woods" and "Judgment Day" and the novel "Youth Without God". Horváth tragically died at the age of 36 when he was struck by a falling branch during a thunderstorm in Paris.</p><p>Despite his young age, Ödön von Horváth had already achieved critical acclaim and gained a reputation as a leading intellectual figure of his time. He was highly regarded for his ability to scrutinize the social and political changes taking place in Europe during the early 20th century. His works were known for their satirical humor, use of irony, and unique insight into the human experience.</p><p>Horváth's literary legacy continued to influence future generations of writers and artists long after his untimely passing. He was the recipient of several posthumous accolades and his works have been translated into numerous languages, reaching a global audience. Today, he is considered a master of 20th century literature and his contributions to the literary world have been acknowledged and celebrated by scholars and readers worldwide.</p><p>In addition to his literary accomplishments, Ödön von Horváth had a fascinating life story. After his family moved to Hungary, he attended school in Pressburg (now Bratislava, Slovakia) and Budapest before studying philosophy and German literature at the University of Munich. During this time, he also worked as a journalist and began writing plays. Horváth's plays were groundbreaking in their approach to theater, with a focus on representing everyday life and social issues rather than traditional plot-driven narratives.</p><p>Despite his success as a writer, Horváth lived a somewhat nomadic life, moving frequently throughout Europe and struggling to make ends meet. He also had a complicated relationship with his homeland of Hungary, which he felt had betrayed him when they revoked his citizenship due to his opposition to fascism. This experience influenced much of his later writing, which often explored themes of displacement, disillusionment, and the search for identity.</p><p>Today, Horváth is remembered as a visionary writer who anticipated many of the political and social upheavals of the 20th century. His works continue to be studied in universities and performed in theaters around the world, a testament to his enduring legacy as a literary trailblazer.</p><p></p><p>
