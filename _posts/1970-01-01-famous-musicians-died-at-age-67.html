was
an American
personality.


					</p><p>He is best known for serving as a Confederate naval officer during the Civil War, having achieved great victories while commanding the CSS Florida and the CSS Albemarle. Maffitt was born in North Carolina, and began his career as a sailor at a young age. He eventually joined the US Navy and became a lieutenant in 1853. When the Civil War broke out, he resigned from the US Navy and joined the Confederacy, rising quickly through the ranks due to his skill and experience. </p><p>Maffitt played a key role in the Confederate Navy's efforts to break the Union blockade of southern ports, and his ships conducted numerous successful raids on Union shipping. Despite facing many challenges, including the loss of several ships, Maffitt's leadership and bravery earned him a reputation as one of the most successful naval commanders of the Confederacy. After the war ended, Maffitt moved to the Bahamas where he became involved in shipping and other business ventures. He later returned to the US and settled in Wilmington, North Carolina, where he died in 1886.</p><p>Maffitt's legacy lives on in the maritime and naval history of the United States. He authored a book entitled "The Florida, Her Building and Operations" which provides a detailed history of the CSS Florida and its successes in capturing Union merchant ships. Maffitt was also known for his skill as a navigator and was credited with discovering a new shortcut through the Bahamas that saved ships time and money in transatlantic crossings. In addition to his naval career, Maffitt was a skilled amateur artist and his paintings of ships have been displayed in galleries and museums in the US and Europe. His son, John Newland Maffitt Jr., followed in his father's footsteps and also served as a naval officer.</p><p>Maffitt was honored for his services during his lifetime and posthumously. He was awarded the Confederate Medal of Honor in recognition of his leadership and bravery during the Civil War. In 1910, the US Navy named a destroyer after him, the USS Maffitt. The destroyer served in both World War I and World War II before being decommissioned. In 2013, Maffitt was inducted into the North Carolina Maritime Hall of Fame, cementing his place in the state's rich history of seafaring and maritime industries. Today, Maffitt's legacy is celebrated in numerous museums, historical societies, and naval associations across the United States. His contributions to the Confederate Navy and to the maritime industry as a whole continue to be studied and recognized by scholars and enthusiasts alike.</p><p>Maffitt's legacy also includes his role in the controversial practice of blockade running during the Civil War. He was known for his daring and success in smuggling supplies through the Union blockade to support the Confederate war effort. However, this also led to accusations of profiteering and piracy, and Maffitt faced legal challenges and criticism after the war. Despite this, his contributions to the Confederacy and his naval achievements have been celebrated and studied for over a century. In addition to the destroyer named after him, Maffitt has been honored with streets, buildings, and other institutions bearing his name throughout the southern United States.</p><p></p><p>

He went on to study under some of the most well-known Egyptologists of his time, such as Karl Richard Lepsius and Samuel Birch. His first trip to Egypt was in 1853, and he subsequently spent several years excavating and researching various aspects of ancient Egyptian culture.Brugsch's contributions to Egyptology were not limited to his scholarly work. He was also deeply involved in the politics of Egypt during his time there, serving as an advisor to the Egyptian monarchy and assisting with various diplomatic missions. This led him to be awarded several honors and decorations from both the Egyptian and German governments.Brugsch was a prolific author, and his books and articles on Egyptology were widely read and influential in the field. One of his most significant works was a seven-volume set titled "Hieroglyphic Dictionary," which was used as a reference by Egyptologists for decades after its publication.Brugsch's impact on Egyptology and the study of ancient civilizations continues to be felt to this day. His work laid the groundwork for generations of scholars to build upon, and his contributions to diplomacy and politics helped to shape the relationship between Germany and Egypt during a crucial time in their histories.</p><p>In addition to his many accomplishments, Brugsch also had a notable personal life. He married Mary Brookes of Liverpool in 1861, and the couple had three children. Brugsch's wife shared his passion for Egyptology and contributed to his publications, as well as maintaining her own research and studies in the field. She also played a role in the preservation and restoration of ancient Egyptian artifacts, which was an important aspect of the field during the time period in which they both worked.</p><p>Brugsch's work was not without controversy, however. Some of his translations and interpretations of ancient Egyptian texts have been challenged by later scholars, and his involvement in politics and diplomacy has been criticized by some as well. Nonetheless, his contributions to the field of Egyptology were significant and lasting, and his legacy continues to inspire and inform scholars today.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions, Brugsch was awarded numerous honors and distinctions throughout his lifetime, including honorary doctorates from several universities and membership in the prestigious Order of the Red Eagle. His work was widely respected and admired among his peers, and his influence can be felt in the ongoing study of ancient Egyptian civilization.</p><p></p><p>

(September 3, 1856		Boston-April 14, 1924			Chicago)

	
		also known as Louis H. Sullivan

	
was
an American
architect.


					</p><p>He is often called the "father of modernism" and is known for his influential work on high-rise buildings. Sullivan was a mentor to architect Frank Lloyd Wright and together they developed the "Prairie School" style of architecture. Sullivan is perhaps best known for his design of the Guaranty Building in Buffalo, NY and the Wainwright Building in St. Louis, MO. In addition to his influential work in architecture, Sullivan was also a prolific writer and a champion of the idea that form follows function in design.</p><p>His philosophy of "form follows function" was a key principle of modernist architecture and was based on the idea that the design of a building should be dictated by its purpose rather than decorative embellishments. Sullivan believed that buildings should not be like other buildings, but should be unique and expressive of their function. Along with Wright, he was a pioneer in the development of skyscrapers and helped to establish their aesthetic and functional principles. Despite his significant contributions to the field of architecture, Sullivan struggled financially and had difficulty finding work in the later years of his life. Sullivan's legacy continues to influence architects and designers today, and he is recognized as one of the most important figures in the development of modernist architecture.</p><p>Sullivan studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before moving to Chicago to work for architect William Le Baron Jenney. In Chicago, Sullivan was introduced to the city's thriving skyline and began to develop his signature style of design. He created intricate and ornate decorative elements that were incorporated into the facades of his buildings, making them both functional and beautiful.</p><p>One of Sullivan's most famous works, the Auditorium Building, was a collaboration with Adler and Sullivan, and is considered one of the finest examples of the Chicago School of Architecture. The building, completed in 1889, featured a 4,000-seat theater and a hotel, and is still in use today as an arts venue.</p><p>Sullivan's career was not without personal challenges. He struggled with alcoholism and had a contentious relationship with his wife, Margaret. In 1911, he was fired from his position at the firm he had founded with Dankmar Adler, and his subsequent work was less successful. He died in the Chicago suburb of Chicago in 1924, at the age of 67.</p><p>Despite his struggles, Sullivan's contributions to modernist architecture continue to be relevant today. His work on skyscrapers and his emphasis on the importance of form following function paved the way for the development of modern skyscrapers, and his influence can be seen in the work of countless architects around the world. Sullivan's legacy as the father of modernism is secure, and his work remains an inspiration to artists, architects, and designers everywhere.</p><p>Sullivan was known for his flamboyant personality and unconventional ideas, which often put him at odds with his peers in the architecture world. He was a vocal critic of the Beaux-Arts style that dominated American architecture at the time, and advocated for a more functional and honest approach to building design. His writings, including the influential essay "The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered", helped to define the principles of modernist architecture that would influence generations of designers.</p><p>In addition to his work as an architect, Sullivan was also an accomplished artist and designer. He created intricate and beautiful decorative elements, including stained glass windows, mosaics, and furniture, that were often incorporated into his buildings. He believed that these decorative elements should be integral to the design of a building, rather than added as an afterthought.</p><p>Sullivan's legacy has been celebrated in numerous exhibitions and retrospectives, including a recent exhibit at the Chicago Cultural Center that showcased his life and work. His influence can be seen in the work of modern architects such as Zaha Hadid and Rem Koolhaas, who continue to push the boundaries of building design and innovation. Sullivan's contribution to the field of architecture, and his unwavering commitment to the idea that form should follow function, make him one of the most important figures in the history of modernist design.</p><p></p><p>

(September 19, 1600		Nottuln-January 31, 1668			Münster)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a Jesuit priest and moral theologian, known for his works in casuistry, which is the branch of moral theology that deals with specific cases of conscience. Busenbaum is most famous for his book "Medulla Theologiae Moralis", which was considered a standard work on casuistry for almost two centuries. He was also a professor of theology at various universities in Europe, including Münster, Ingolstadt, and Dillingen. Busenbaum's teachings and writings were influential in shaping the moral theology of the Catholic Church during the Counter-Reformation era.</p><p>Born in Nottuln, Westphalia, Hermann Busenbaum entered the Society of Jesus in 1616, where he studied philosophy, theology, and canon law. He was ordained as a priest in 1627 and eventually became a professor of theology at the University of Münster. </p><p>In addition to his writing in casuistry, Busenbaum was also known for his contributions to Catholic apologetics. His book, "Introductio ad Veram Philosophiam" (Introduction to Real Philosophy), defended Aristotelian scholasticism against modern philosophical trends. </p><p>Busenbaum's influence extended beyond his own lifetime. His "Medulla Theologiae Moralis" was widely used as a textbook in seminaries until the 19th century, and his approach to casuistry was adopted by later thinkers such as Alphonsus Liguori. </p><p>Despite being a controversial figure in his time, accused of laxism in his moral theology, Busenbaum's work continues to be studied and appreciated by scholars of Catholic moral theology and philosophy.</p><p>Busenbaum's impact was not only limited to academic circles but also extended to the Catholic Church hierarchy. His works were frequently consulted by bishops and theologians who sought guidance on complex moral issues. Busenbaum's approach to casuistry emphasized the importance of taking into account the particular circumstances of an individual's situation in making moral decisions. This approach was seen as a departure from the more rigid and abstract approach of earlier theologians, and it was criticized by some as being too permissive.</p><p>Despite the criticisms, Busenbaum's influence on Catholic moral theology was substantial. His ideas on casuistry helped to shape the development of Catholic moral doctrine, particularly in the areas of confession and the sacrament of penance. His emphasis on the importance of individual circumstances has also been cited as an influence on contemporary moral theology, which takes into account the complexity and diversity of modern life.</p><p>In addition to his scholarly work, Busenbaum was known for his piety and devotion to the Catholic faith. He was a fervent supporter of the Counter-Reformation and worked to promote Catholicism in Germany and other parts of Europe. Busenbaum died in Münster in 1668, leaving behind a legacy of scholarship and devotion to the Catholic Church.</p><p>Busenbaum's "Medulla Theologiae Moralis" was widely praised for its clarity and accessibility, as well as for its thorough treatment of moral theology. The book was organized by topics, such as the Ten Commandments, the virtues, and the sacraments, and provided guidance on how to apply moral principles to specific cases. Busenbaum also addressed controversial moral issues of his time, such as usury and the treatment of indigenous peoples in the newly discovered lands.In addition to his academic and religious work, Busenbaum was also involved in the political affairs of his time. He served as an advisor to the Bishop of Münster and was involved in negotiations between the Holy Roman Empire and the Netherlands during the Thirty Years' War.Busenbaum's legacy continues to be felt in the field of moral theology. His approach to casuistry has been seen as a precursor to modern ethical theories such as situation ethics and narrative ethics. His emphasis on the importance of individual circumstances has also been cited as an influence on contemporary pastoral care and counseling. Today, he is remembered as a significant figure in the Catholic intellectual tradition and as one of the most important moral theologians of his time.</p><p></p><p>

He returned to Poland after the outbreak of World War I and formed the First Brigade of the Polish Legions to fight for Poland's independence.</p><p>After regaining independence for Poland, Piłsudski was briefly a member of the Polish parliament, but he soon became disillusioned with the political process and staged a coup in 1926 to become Poland's de facto dictator. He implemented policies that limited civil liberties and suppressed opposition, but his rule was also characterized by progressive social and economic reforms.</p><p>Piłsudski was also a strong advocate for interwar European security, promoting a regional alliance between Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. This alliance was known as the "Intermarium" and was meant to counteract the influence of Germany and the Soviet Union in the region. Despite his authoritarian rule, Piłsudski remained popular and was seen as a beloved national hero until his death in 1935.</p><p>Piłsudski was a prolific writer and his works include books on military strategy and Polish history. He is also known for his artistic talents, particularly as a composer and musician. Piłsudski led a simple and austere lifestyle, often living in a small apartment with minimal possessions. He was known for his integrity and honesty, and was admired for his dedication to the Polish people.Piłsudski's legacy as a national hero and father of modern Poland remains strong in Poland today, and he is venerated as one of the country's greatest leaders. Statues and monuments in his honor can be found throughout Poland and his image is still featured on banknotes and coins.</p><p>After Piłsudski's death, his passing was mourned by Polish citizens throughout the country. His funeral was attended by thousands of people, and he was buried in the crypts of Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, alongside other notable figures in Polish history. Despite his controversial legacy as an authoritarian leader, his contributions to modernizing and securing Poland after its independence are still highly regarded. As a result, his story continues to be studied and celebrated by historians, political scientists, and other experts around the world.</p><p></p><p>

Additionally, he was a skilled painter and poet, and his artwork has been displayed in galleries in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Perlis was also a member of the National Academy of Engineering and was awarded the National Medal of Science posthumously in 1994. His contributions to computer science continue to influence the field today, particularly in the areas of programming language design and computer science education.</p><p>Perlis was known for his unique sense of humor, which can be seen in his famous "Epigrams on Programming." These succinct and witty sayings are still shared and celebrated by many computer programmers today. One of his most famous epigrams reads, "Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it." Perlis was also known for his love of puns, often using them in his lectures and writings.</p><p>Throughout his career, Perlis received numerous honors and awards in recognition of his contributions to computer science. In addition to the Turing Award and National Medal of Science, he was also a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Perlis was widely respected by his colleagues and students for his intelligence, creativity, and commitment to advancing the field of computer science.</p><p></p><p>

(August 7, 1852		Montpellier-December 19, 1919			South Mimms)

	
		also known as Arnold Harris Mathew or Arnold Harris Ochterlony Matthews

	
was
an English
bishop.


					</p><p>He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1884 and later became a bishop of the Old Catholic Church in Great Britain. In addition to his religious work, Mathew was a controversial figure due to his involvement with the Catholic Apostolic Church and claims of being the Archpriest of the Abbé Saunière, the priest rumored to have discovered a wealth of treasure in the French village of Rennes-le-Château. Mathew was also a prolific writer, authoring several books on religious topics and history, as well as a translator of medieval Latin and French texts. Despite his controversial reputation, Mathew is recognized as a significant figure in the history of independent Catholicism in England.</p><p>Mathew's involvement with the Catholic Apostolic Church began in his youth when he became a member of the church, which was a Christian sect that believed in the imminent return of Christ. Mathew eventually rose to the rank of apostle within the church but became disillusioned with its leadership and left the church in 1892.</p><p>In 1908, Mathew was consecrated as an Old Catholic bishop by Bishop Gerard Gul of the Netherlands, and he became the bishop of the Old Catholic Church in Great Britain. He established several parishes in England and also established the Old Catholic Press, which published many of his writings.</p><p>Mathew's claims of being the Archpriest of the Abbé Saunière and his alleged involvement in the mystery of Rennes-le-Château have been the subject of much speculation and controversy. Some have accused him of being a fraud and a charlatan, while others believe that he was unfairly maligned and that there may be some truth to his claims.</p><p>Mathew died in 1919, and his legacy remains a subject of debate among scholars of independent Catholicism and the mystery of Rennes-le-Château.</p><p>In addition to his religious and controversial pursuits, Arnold Mathew was also involved in politics. He ran unsuccessfully for a parliamentary seat as a candidate of the Social Democratic Federation in 1885. Later in life, he supported Irish nationalism and joined Sinn Féin, a political party advocating for Irish independence. Mathew was also an advocate for animal rights and abstained from consuming meat. Despite his idiosyncrasies, Mathew's influence can still be seen in the Old Catholic Church, which he helped to establish in England. Today, the Old Catholic Church traces its roots to the Jansenist movement of the 17th century and maintains a separate existence from the Roman Catholic Church  while still maintaining apostolic succession.</p><p>In addition to his religious and political pursuits, Arnold Mathew was also an accomplished linguist. He studied at Trinity College, Dublin and was fluent in several languages, including Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and French. He also served as a translator for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and translated several works from medieval Latin and Old French into English.</p><p>Mathew was married twice and had two daughters. His first wife, Louisa Clayton, died in 1880 after only two years of marriage. He later married Emily Hogg in 1884. Emily was an accomplished writer and translator in her own right and collaborated with Mathew on several projects.</p><p>Despite his controversial reputation, Mathew was known for his generosity and kindness towards those in need. He often dedicated his time and resources towards helping the poor and destitute, and he established several charitable organizations during his lifetime.</p><p>Today, Mathew is remembered as a significant figure in the history of independent Catholicism and as a complex and multifaceted individual whose life and legacy continue to fascinate scholars and enthusiasts around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(January 25, 1886		New York City-May 29, 1953)


was
an American
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He studied at the Art Students League of New York and the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris, where he became interested in the concepts of Neo-Impressionism and color theory. Russell became a pioneer of the American modernist movement, and along with his friend Stanton Macdonald-Wright, developed a new style of painting called Synchromism. Synchromism aimed to capture the rhythms and harmonies found in music by employing vibrant colors and bold geometric shapes. Russell returned to the United States and continued to paint and exhibit his work throughout the 1920s and 1930s. In addition to his artistic pursuits, Russell was also an advocate for the preservation of Native American art and culture.</p><p>He spent significant time living and working among the Pueblo tribes in New Mexico, and was instrumental in the formation of the Indian Arts Fund, which aimed to promote Native American artists and their work. Russell's own paintings often incorporated elements of Native American art and design, as well as the landscapes and colors of the American Southwest. Despite his contributions to the modernist movement, Russell's work fell out of favor during the mid-20th century and he was largely forgotten in the years after his death. However, his paintings have experienced a resurgence of interest in recent years, with a number of exhibitions and retrospectives highlighting his contributions to American art.</p><p>Russell's interest in color theory and his work in Synchromism led him to write a book called "Modern Painting: Its Tendency and Meaning." The book included detailed descriptions of the Synchromist movement and its philosophy on color and form. Russell also collaborated with Macdonald-Wright on a mural for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. The mural, titled "The Conquest of the Air," was one of the largest paintings of its time, measuring over 18 feet in height and 120 feet in length. In addition to his artistic and cultural pursuits, Russell also had a successful career as a teacher. He taught at a number of institutions, including the Art Students League of New York, and counted artist Georgia O'Keeffe among his students. Today, Russell's paintings can be found in the collections of major museums, including the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.</p><p>Russell's personal life was also marked by his marriage to fellow artist and Synchromism pioneer, Suzanne Valadon. Valadon, who was previously a model for artists like Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, had a successful career as a painter in her own right. The couple met in Paris and married in 1914, and their relationship was marked by its artistic collaboration and mutual admiration. Russell and Valadon maintained a close relationship with other artists in the avant-garde community, including Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia. Russell continued to paint and exhibit his work until his death in 1953 at the age of 67. His legacy continues to inspire and influence contemporary artists to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(February 20, 1906		Neustrelitz-March 17, 1973			Bonn)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a high-ranking official in the Nazi Party and played a significant role in the deportation of Jews to concentration camps during World War II. Rademacher was also involved in the Wannsee Conference in 1942, where Nazi leaders planned the "Final Solution" to exterminate Jews in Europe. After the war, he was arrested and charged with war crimes but was later released. Rademacher worked as a businessman in West Germany and was never fully held accountable for his actions during the Holocaust.</p><p>Franz Rademacher was born in Neustrelitz, Germany, in February 1906. He joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and became an important figure in the German Foreign Office, working under the notorious Joachim von Ribbentrop. As the head of the Jewish department, Rademacher played a critical role in the deportation of Jews to concentration camps during World War II, mainly in France and Serbia.</p><p>In 1942, Rademacher was one of the participants in the Wannsee Conference, where Nazi officials gathered to plan the "Final Solution" to the Jewish question. Rademacher proposed that Jews be sent to Madagascar, an island off the eastern coast of Africa, which was later deemed impractical.</p><p>After the war, Rademacher was arrested by the Allies and charged with war crimes. In 1949, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but he only served five before being released. He then worked as an industrialist in West Germany and faced little to no consequences for his actions during the Holocaust.</p><p>Despite his role in the mass murder of Jews, Rademacher never expressed remorse for his actions. He remained unrepentant until his death in Bonn in March 1973.</p><p>Rademacher's involvement in the Holocaust extended beyond his work in the Foreign Office. He was also responsible for organizing the deportation of Jews from Serbia, where he implemented a policy of collective punishment that resulted in the execution of thousands of Jews and Serbs alike. </p><p>During his trial, Rademacher attempted to shift blame onto his superiors, arguing that his actions were simply in compliance with Nazi policies. However, evidence presented at the trial showed that he was a willing and enthusiastic participant in the atrocities committed against Jews and other minorities.</p><p>In addition to his work in the Nazi Party, Rademacher was also a keen student of ancient history and literature. He obtained a doctorate in classical philology before joining the Foreign Office and remained an avid scholar throughout his life. Despite his academic pursuits, however, Rademacher will forever be remembered for his role in the Holocaust and his lack of remorse for the atrocities he committed.</p><p>Rademacher's academic pursuits actually had an impact on his involvement in the Holocaust. He believed that the Jews were the descendants of the ancient Israelites and saw their extermination as a way to rid Europe of what he viewed as a "polluting" influence. This belief in the racial and cultural superiority of the German people was a common theme among many high-ranking officials in the Nazi Party, including Rademacher. </p><p>After his release from prison, Rademacher went on to work for several German companies, including the chemical company I.G. Farben, which was heavily involved in the use of forced labor in concentration camps during World War II. He faced little public scrutiny for his past actions and was able to live out the rest of his life in relative anonymity.</p><p>It wasn't until the 1960s, when Nazi war criminals began to be put on trial in West Germany, that Rademacher's role in the Holocaust was publicized again. However, he was never brought to trial for his actions in Serbia and was able to avoid legal consequences for his atrocities.</p><p>Rademacher's legacy as a war criminal remains controversial to this day. Some argue that he was a mere cog in the Nazi machine, while others maintain that his personal beliefs and active participation in the Holocaust make him just as culpable as other high-ranking officials. Regardless, his involvement in one of the darkest periods in human history serves as a reminder of the importance of holding individuals accountable for their actions, no matter how powerful or influential they may be.</p><p></p><p>
