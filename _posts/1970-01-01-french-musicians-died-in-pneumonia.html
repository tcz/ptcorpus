This novel consists of seven volumes and is considered one of the greatest works of fiction in Western literature. Proust spent over 14 years writing this novel, which explores themes of memory, time, love, and social class. In addition to his literary achievements, Proust was an active member of Parisian high society and was known for his sharp wit and eccentricities. He suffered from asthma and spent much of his life in poor health, but this didn't deter him from pursuing his passion for writing. Today, Proust is considered one of the most influential writers of the 20th century and his works continue to be studied and appreciated by readers around the world.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=21018" title="Wikipedia article about Marcel Proust">Marcel Proust on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Michel Petrucciani</h2><p><strong>Michel Petrucciani</strong>
