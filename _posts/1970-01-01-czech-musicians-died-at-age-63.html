He was also a frequent visitor to the Balkans, where he conducted fieldwork and expanded his knowledge of the area's history and culture. Jireček's legacy continues with the Jireček Line, a geographical boundary he proposed in 1911 to separate the speakers of Eastern Romance (such as Romanian) and Slavic languages in the Balkans.

Jireček's brother was a historian and archaeologist who is known for his work on the Byzantine Empire and the Balkans.</p><p>Despite his academic achievements, Jireček faced some criticism over his political views. He was initially affiliated with the Young Czech Party, a nationalist movement that sought greater autonomy for Czechs within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, Jireček later became more supportive of the empire and argued that Czechs should work within the system to achieve their goals. This shift in his political stance led to some controversy and criticism from other Czech nationalists.</p><p>Jireček also had a significant impact on the development of the Czech language. He was a proponent of the standardization of Czech grammar and spelling, and helped create the first Czech spelling dictionary in 1885. Today, he is recognized as one of the key figures in the modernization of the Czech language.</p><p>Overall, Jireček's contributions to the fields of history, linguistics, and politics were significant and far-reaching.
