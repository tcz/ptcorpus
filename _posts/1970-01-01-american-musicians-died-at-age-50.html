					</p><p>Whitehead was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and studied at the University of Virginia. He wrote poetry and short stories in his early career, but is best known for his contributions to the genre of horror fiction. His work often focused on the supernatural and the occult, and he was heavily influenced by his travels to the West Indies, where he began writing stories based on the local folklore.</p><p>Whitehead's most famous works include "Jumbee" and "The People of Pan", both of which were published in Weird Tales magazine. He also wrote a series of stories featuring a character known as Captain O'Malley, a detective with a fondness for the supernatural.</p><p>Despite his success as a writer, Whitehead struggled with alcoholism throughout his life, and his writing career was cut short by his untimely death at the age of 50. Today, he is remembered as one of the preeminent writers of horror fiction in the early 20th century, and his influence can be seen in the work of contemporary authors like H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King.</p><p>Whitehead's fascination with the supernatural can be attributed to his interest in the occult and his travels to the West Indies, where he became fascinated with local folklore and the voodoo religion. His experiences in the Caribbean greatly influenced his work, which often featured themes of voodoo, superstition, and other supernatural elements.</p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Whitehead's work has had a lasting impact on the horror genre. His stories have been praised for their vivid imagery and atmospheric descriptions, and his unique blend of supernatural elements with detective fiction helped pave the way for later works in the genre.</p><p>In addition to his fiction writing, Whitehead was also a noted poet and essayist. He frequently contributed to literary journals and magazines, and his work was well-respected by his contemporaries.</p><p>Today, Whitehead's work continues to be celebrated by fans of horror fiction and scholars of American literature.
