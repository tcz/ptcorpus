(August 15, 1914-July 3, 1939)


was
a Polish
personality.


					</p><p>He was a poet, writer, and journalist who actively participated in the political and social events of his time. Throughout his short life, Gad fought for the rights and freedoms of the Jewish community in Poland, and his work played a significant role in the resistance movement against Nazi occupation. He was a key member of the underground Jewish Military Organization, helping to publish illegal newspapers and propaganda in order to spread information and resistance. Gad's work was not limited to political activism, as he also wrote a number of poems and stories that were published in various Polish newspapers and literary magazines. Unfortunately, he was executed by the Gestapo at the young age of 24, but his legacy lived on through his work and the impact he had on the resistance movement.</p><p>Gad was born in the city of Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland, and grew up in nearby Łódź. He was the son of a Jewish family, which instilled in him a strong sense of identity and cultural pride. Gad showed an early talent for writing, and he began publishing his work in local newspapers and magazines by the age of 16.</p><p>In 1933, Gad enrolled in the University of Warsaw, where he studied literature and philosophy. It was during this time that he became involved in left-wing political activism, joining the ranks of the socialist and communist movements in Poland. He was also an active member of the Jewish student union, working to promote Jewish culture and defend the rights of Jewish students.</p><p>As the Nazi regime began to spread across Europe, Gad's activism became increasingly focused on the struggle for Jewish rights and resistance against fascism. He joined the Jewish Military Organization (Żydowski Związek Wojskowy; ŻZW), one of several Jewish armed resistance groups that operated in occupied Poland. Within ŻZW, Gad was responsible for producing and distributing underground newspapers and leaflets that exposed Nazi atrocities and encouraged resistance.</p><p>In 1939, Gad was arrested by the Gestapo and sentenced to death for his activities with ŻZW. Despite efforts by his family and colleagues to secure his release, he was executed on July 3, 1939. His legacy as a courageous writer, activist, and fighter against fascism lives on to this day.</p><p>Gad's literary work was heavily influenced by his political and social beliefs, and he often used his writing to promote Jewish culture and history. His poems and stories were published in a number of Polish literary magazines, including Nowa Kultura and Wiadomości Literackie. Gad was hailed by some as a rising star in the world of Polish literature, and his work received praise from several contemporary writers and critics.</p><p>After his death, Gad's legacy inspired many Jewish resistance fighters and activists, who continued to fight against Nazi oppression and anti-Semitism. Several buildings and institutions in Israel and Poland have been named in his honor, including the Hubert Gad Memorial Center in Jerusalem. Gad's work and his fight for justice continue to inspire generations to fight against fascism, oppression, and prejudice.</p><p>Additionally, Gad was known for his love of languages and had a talent for translating. He translated works by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Edgar Allan Poe into Polish, and also translated works from Polish into Hebrew. Gad was fluent in several languages, including Polish, Hebrew, Yiddish, German, and Russian. His linguistic skills were a valuable asset to the underground resistance, as he was able to communicate with and translate for members of different groups and languages. </p><p>Gad's life and legacy were not only celebrated within Jewish communities but also recognized by the wider world. In 2015, a monument in his honor was unveiled in his hometown of Piotrków Trybunalski, where he is remembered as a hero and a symbol of resistance against oppression. His literary work is still studied and celebrated for its powerful and eloquent voice that challenged fascist ideas and advocated for human rights.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 2015		Chorzów-April 5, 1991)


was
a Polish
personality.


					</p><p>Jerzy Wostal was a renowned Polish painter, sculptor, and graphic artist who was born on April 5, 1915, in Chorzów, Poland. He was particularly known for his unique style of abstract and non-figurative art that often incorporated vivid colors and geometric shapes. Wostal was a member of the Krakow Group, a collective of experimental artists who emerged in the 1950s and whose innovative approach to art had a significant impact on contemporary Polish art. Throughout his career, he had numerous solo exhibitions in Poland, as well as in France, Belgium, and Germany. His works are now part of many prestigious private and public collections, including the National Museum in Wroclaw and the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw. Wostal passed away on April 5, 1991, at the age of 76, leaving behind an impressive legacy in the world of art.</p><p>Despite the many obstacles he faced in his personal life, including being drafted into the German army during World War II, Wostal continued to create art that celebrated life and beauty. He was especially interested in the interplay of light and color and used these elements to create works that were both visually striking and emotionally evocative. In addition to his work as a painter and sculptor, Wostal was also an accomplished graphic artist, designing book covers and other materials for a range of clients.</p><p>Throughout his life, Wostal remained committed to promoting the arts in Poland, serving as a mentor and teacher to younger generations of artists. His contributions to the development of contemporary Polish art were recognized by the Polish government, which awarded him with the prestigious Order of Polonia Restituta in 1989. Today, he is remembered as one of Poland's most original and influential artists, whose work continues to inspire and captivate audiences around the world.</p><p>Jerzy Wostal's artistic journey began when he enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow in 1945, where he studied painting under the guidance of noted Polish artists such as Tadeusz Kantor and Artur Nacht-Samborski. However, his studies were cut short when he was drafted into the German army during World War II. After the war, he returned to the academy and graduated with honors in 1951.</p><p>Wostal's early works were figurative, but he gradually moved towards abstract art, exploring the possibilities of color, light, and form. His breakthrough came in the mid-1950s when he began creating paintings that were entirely non-figurative, featuring bold geometric shapes and bright, contrasting colors. He also experimented with different materials, using industrial paints and synthetic resins to create new textures and effects.</p><p>In the 1960s and 1970s, Wostal became more involved in sculpture and installations, creating works that often combined natural and industrial materials such as wood, metal, and concrete. He was particularly interested in the relationship between sculpture and its environment, and his works often interacted with the space around them in surprising ways.</p><p>Despite his success, Wostal remained humble and dedicated to his work, rarely giving interviews or seeking publicity. He once said, "An artist can only speak through his work. The rest is silence." Today, his legacy lives on through the many artists he influenced and the works he created, which continue to inspire and challenge audiences around the world.</p><p>In addition to his artistic career, Jerzy Wostal was also an advocate for cultural heritage preservation. He served as the president of the Chorzów Branch of the Association of Polish Artists and Designers, where he led efforts to protect historic sites in the Silesia region of Poland. He also collaborated with the Chorzów Museum to organize exhibitions of contemporary art, further demonstrating his commitment to promoting the arts in his community.</p><p>Wostal's contributions to the arts have been recognized with numerous awards and honors. In addition to the Order of Polonia Restituta, he was also awarded the Gold Cross of Merit and the Medal for Merit to Culture. He was also granted an honorary degree from the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow.</p><p>Today, Wostal's works can be found in many prominent collections, both in Poland and abroad. His unique style, which combined abstraction with vibrant colors and geometric shapes, continues to inspire artists around the world. Jerzy Wostal remains an important figure in the history of Polish art and a testament to the enduring power of creativity and innovation.</p><p></p><p>
