		also known as Alpetragius or Biṭrūjī

	
was
a Moroccan
writer, philosopher and astronomer.


					</p><p>Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji was born in the early 12th century in Andalusia, Spain. He studied astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy in Cordoba and became known for his work in astronomy. He is particularly known for his critique of Aristotle's theory of celestial motion and his own theory of planetary motion. He argued that the planets moved in elliptical orbits around the sun, years before this idea was adopted by European astronomers.</p><p>In addition to his work in astronomy, al-Bitruji wrote on many other subjects including medicine, geometry, and theology. He also served as a judge in his hometown of Seville for many years. Al-Bitruji's work had a significant impact on the development of astronomy and the scientific method in Europe during the Middle Ages. His ideas were influential in the work of later astronomers such as Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler.</p><p>Al-Bitruji's most famous work is his "On the Principles of Astronomy" where he criticized Aristotelian cosmology and put forth his own theories. He believed that the universe was finite, with a limited number of stars, and that the Earth was not the center of the universe, but rather orbited the sun. He also proposed that the tilt of the Earth's axis was responsible for the changing seasons.</p><p>Al-Bitruji's work was largely unknown in Europe until it was translated into Latin in the 13th century by Spanish Jewish scholar Gerard of Cremona. His ideas were studied by European medieval scholars and helped pave the way for the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries.</p><p>Although al-Bitruji's contributions to science were significant, he was also known for his humanitarianism and religious piety. He was said to have devoted a portion of his income to helping the poor and needy, and his writings often reflected his spiritual beliefs.</p><p>Al-Bitruji died in the early 13th century in Seville, where he had spent most of his life working as a judge and philosopher. His legacy lives on, not only in the field of astronomy, but as a model of a well-rounded and compassionate intellectual.</p><p>In addition to his famous work "On the Principles of Astronomy," Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji also wrote a number of other works on astronomy and philosophy, including "The Book of Light on the Principles of Oneness," "The Book of the Stars' Paths and Distances," and "The Foundations of Harmony and Agreement Between Religions." He was known for his interdisciplinary approach to learning, drawing on Islamic, Greek, and Persian thought to develop his own theories and arguments.</p><p>Al-Bitruji's influence extended beyond the scientific and intellectual spheres. He was also active in the social and political spheres, using his position as a judge to advocate for justice and equality. He was a vocal opponent of corruption and abuse of power, and frequently spoke out against those who exploited their positions for personal gain.</p><p>Despite his contributions to astronomy and philosophy, al-Bitruji remained a deeply religious person throughout his life. His beliefs were shaped by his study of Islamic theology and Sufism, and he saw no contradiction between his scientific pursuits and his faith. He believed that the study of the natural world was a means of understanding and appreciating the greatness of God's creation.</p><p>Today, al-Bitruji's legacy continues to inspire scholars and thinkers around the world. His work in astronomy helped lay the foundations for modern astronomy, and his broader contributions to philosophy and social justice serve as a reminder of the importance of compassion, critical thinking, and a commitment to pursuing truth and justice.</p><p></p><p>
