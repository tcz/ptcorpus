(November 14, 1863		Sint-Martens-Latem-February 23, 1944			Beacon)

	
		also known as L. H. Baekeland

	
was
a Belgian
inventor, chemist and engineer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his invention of Bakelite, an inexpensive, nonflammable, and versatile plastic that was used in a wide variety of applications, including electrical insulators, automotive parts, and consumer goods. Baekeland received numerous awards and honors for his work and was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1978. In addition to his work on Bakelite, Baekeland also made significant contributions to the fields of photography and medicine, and he held over 150 patents in his lifetime. He died in 1944 at the age of 80.</p><p>Baekeland was born in Belgium and moved to the United States in 1889 to pursue his career. He worked as a researcher at various companies before establishing his own laboratory in New York in 1899. It was there that he began experimenting with synthetic resins, which led to the development of Bakelite.</p><p>Apart from his scientific pursuits, Baekeland was also a philanthropist and a patron of the arts. He donated large sums of money to various organizations and established the Leo and Hermine Baekeland Fellowship to support scientific research. He was also a collector of art and amassed a significant collection of works by artists such as Vincent van Gogh and Pablo Picasso.</p><p>Baekeland was married twice and had two children. His son, George, followed in his father's footsteps and became a chemist, while his daughter, Nina, was a painter and sculptor. Today, Baekeland's legacy lives on through the continued use of Bakelite and his contributions to science and industry.</p><p>Baekeland's interest in photography led him to invent Velox photographic paper in 1893, which revolutionized the field by allowing for faster and more reliable image development. He also conducted research on the use of formaldehyde as a preservative for biological specimens, which had a significant impact on the field of medicine. </p><p>Throughout his career, Baekeland was a strong advocate for scientific education and research. He wrote numerous articles and books, and served as president of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the Society of Chemical Industry. </p><p>In his later years, Baekeland suffered from poor health and withdrew from active participation in his laboratory. He passed away in his home in Beacon, New York in 1944. Today, a historical plaque marks the site of his laboratory in Yonkers, New York, and his legacy continues to inspire generations of scientists and inventors.</p><p>Baekeland's invention of Bakelite was a game-changer in the world of plastics. Before Bakelite, the only plastics available were natural materials like rubber or celluloid, which were expensive and highly flammable. Bakelite was the first synthetic plastic made from a combination of phenol and formaldehyde, which could be molded into a variety of shapes and colors. It was also highly resistant to heat and electricity, making it ideal for use in electrical equipment and appliances.</p><p>Despite its many benefits, Bakelite eventually fell out of favor in the mid-20th century as newer, more versatile plastics were developed. However, it remains an important part of the history of plastics and is still used today in some specialized applications.</p><p>In addition to his scientific contributions, Baekeland was also known for his personal eccentricities. He was a highly opinionated and often difficult person, with a sharp wit and a tendency to offend others with his blunt language. He was also known for his love of animals, and kept a menagerie of dogs, cats, ducks, and other animals at his estate in Beacon.</p><p>Throughout his life, Baekeland remained committed to the pursuit of knowledge and discovery. He once said, "I have a restless, searching spirit which drives me on to investigate and discover the truth of things." His legacy as an inventor, scientist, and philanthropist continues to inspire new generations of innovators.</p><p></p><p>
