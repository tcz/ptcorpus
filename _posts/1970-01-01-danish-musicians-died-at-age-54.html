		also known as Tyge Ottesen Brahe or Tycho Ottesen Brahe

	
was
a Danish
chemist, astronomer and nobleman.


					
			
		He had
		eight
		children,
		Elisabeth Brahe, Tyge Brahe, Jörgen Brahe, Claudius Brahe, Kirstine Brahe, Sidsel Brahe, Magdalene Brahe and Sophie Brahe.

						</p><p>Tycho Brahe is best known for his observations of the planets and stars, including his detailed study of a supernova in 1572. He built significant instruments and tools in the field of astronomy which assisted him in his observations. Tycho Brahe made many groundbreaking contributions to the field of astronomy, including his discovery that comets orbit the sun.</p><p>He was born in Scania, which was then part of Denmark, to a noble family. At the age of 13, Tycho Brahe witnessed a solar eclipse, which sparked his interest in astronomy. He went on to study law and astronomy at the University of Copenhagen, but later dropped out to focus solely on astronomy.</p><p>Tycho Brahe was known for his eccentric personality, as well as his love for science and learning. He lost part of his nose in a sword fight, which he covered with a prosthetic made of silver and gold. He also owned a pet moose, which he trained to drink beer from a bucket.</p><p>In 1599, Tycho Brahe became court astronomer to Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II in Prague. He died just two years later in October 1601, at the age of 54. His observations and discoveries paved the way for future advancements in astronomy and our understanding of the universe.</p><p>Tycho Brahe was not only an astronomer but also made significant contributions in the field of chemistry. He was a pioneer in the use of quantitative analysis in chemistry and was known for his detailed experiments on the nature of substances. One of his notable works was the publication of a table of atomic weights of various substances that he had analyzed.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Tycho Brahe was not always well-respected by his peers in the scientific community. This was partly due to his stubborn personality and his refusal to fully embrace the heliocentric model of the solar system proposed by Copernicus. Tycho Brahe instead proposed a hybrid model that blended both heliocentrism and geocentrism.</p><p>After his death, his assistant Johannes Kepler used Tycho Brahe's observations to develop his laws of planetary motion, which greatly advanced the field of astronomy. Today, Tycho Brahe is remembered as one of the most influential figures in the history of astronomy and chemistry.</p><p></p><p>
