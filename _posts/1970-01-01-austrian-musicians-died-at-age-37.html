									</h1><p>Here are 3 famous musicians from Austria died at 37:</p><h2>Georg von Peuerbach</h2><p><strong>Georg von Peuerbach</strong>
(May 30, 1423		Peuerbach-April 8, 1461			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
mathematician and astronomer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work as a professor of astronomy at the University of Vienna and as a master to renowned astronomer Johannes Müller von Königsberg, also known as Regiomontanus. In addition to his work in astronomy, von Peuerbach made significant contributions to the fields of trigonometry and spherical geometry. His most notable works include the Tabulae Ecclipsium, a text on lunar and solar eclipses, and the Theoricae Novae Planetarum, which provided detailed explanations of the motions of the planets. Von Peuerbach's work helped pave the way for the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, and his legacy continues to influence modern scholars in the fields of astronomy and mathematics.</p><p>Von Peuerbach was born in a small town in Upper Austria and attended the University of Vienna, where he studied liberal arts and mathematics. He later traveled throughout Europe to study astronomy and other sciences, eventually becoming a renowned expert in the field. In addition to his academic pursuits, von Peuerbach also served as a court astrologer to several prominent rulers in Europe, including King Ladislaus the Posthumous of Hungary.</p><p>Von Peuerbach's contributions to astronomy were particularly significant, as he helped develop new methods for measuring and predicting celestial events. He was particularly interested in the study of eclipses, and his Tabulae Ecclipsium became an invaluable resource for astronomers and astrologers throughout Europe. He also worked to improve the accuracy of astronomical instruments, such as astrolabes and quadrants, which allowed for more precise measurements of celestial bodies.</p><p>Von Peuerbach's legacy was continued by his student, Regiomontanus, who went on to publish many of his teacher's works posthumously. The two men are often credited with laying the groundwork for the scientific revolution by promoting the use of empirical evidence and mathematical calculations in scientific fields. Today, von Peuerbach is recognized as one of the most important figures in the history of astronomy and mathematics, and his works continue to inspire new generations of scholars.</p><p>Von Peuerbach's contributions to the field of trigonometry and spherical geometry were also significant. He developed new methods for solving trigonometric problems and wrote the Theoricae Novae Planetarum, which included a detailed exposition of the trigonometry of spherical triangles. Von Peuerbach's work in this area also helped advance the study of geography and cartography, as it allowed for more precise mapping of the Earth's surface. His work on spherical geometry would later prove crucial in the development of calculus and the study of differential geometry.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, von Peuerbach's life was cut short at the age of 37 due to illness. However, his influence on the history of science and mathematics has been enduring. His work helped pave the way for the development of the scientific method, which would revolutionize the way that knowledge was acquired and tested. Von Peuerbach's willingness to question accepted wisdom and to use innovative methods to solve problems continue to inspire scientists today.</p><p></p><p>

(July 5, 1554		Vienna-January 22, 1592			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					
			
		She had
		one
		child,
		Marie Elisabeth of France.

						</p><p>Elisabeth of Austria, also known as Elisabeth of Habsburg, was the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II and his wife, Maria of Spain. In 1570, she married King Charles IX of France in a diplomatic marriage arranged by her uncle, Emperor Maximilian II. </p><p>As queen consort of France, Elisabeth was known for her beauty and intelligence, but she struggled to adjust to the French court and customs. She was also deeply religious and had a strong influence on her husband's religious policies, which contributed to the outbreak of the French Wars of Religion.</p><p>After Charles IX's death in 1574, Elisabeth returned to Austria and lived there for the rest of her life. She continued to hold a prominent position in the Habsburg court and was a patron of the arts and sciences. Despite her short reign as Queen of France, Elisabeth left a lasting impression on the country's history and culture.</p><p>Throughout her time as Queen of France, Elisabeth faced numerous challenges and obstacles, including the constant pressures of court life and political tensions between Catholics and Huguenots. Despite these challenges, Elisabeth was known for her kindness and compassion, and she often used her position of power to help those in need.</p><p>Elisabeth was also a lover of the arts, and she played an important role in promoting the cultural development of both France and Austria. She was a patron of numerous artists, musicians, and writers, and her support helped to foster the growth of the Renaissance movement throughout Europe.</p><p>In addition to her cultural contributions, Elisabeth was also a devoted mother and spent much of her time caring for her daughter, Marie Elisabeth. After her husband's death, Elisabeth devoted herself to raising and educating her daughter, and she worked tirelessly to ensure that Marie Elisabeth received the best education possible.</p><p>Despite her many accomplishments, Elisabeth's life was cut tragically short when she died at the young age of 37. However, her legacy as an influential and compassionate queen, as well as a patron of the arts and sciences, lives on to this day.</p><p>Elisabeth of Austria's position as a member of the Habsburg family made her a valuable pawn in the political games of her time. Her marriage to Charles IX was arranged in part to strengthen the political ties between Austria and France. However, the marriage was fraught with difficulties from the beginning, and Elisabeth struggled to find her place at the French court. She was never fully accepted by the French nobility, who resented her status as a foreign queen.</p><p>As a devout Catholic, Elisabeth was deeply troubled by the religious conflicts that were tearing France apart. She used her influence as queen to advocate for tolerance and peace, but her efforts were largely unsuccessful. The St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed, occurred during her reign, and she was unable to prevent it.</p><p>Despite the challenges she faced, Elisabeth is remembered as a woman of great intelligence, beauty, and charm. She enjoyed music and dance and was known for her elegant fashion sense. She was a skilled diplomat and negotiator, and she used her connections with her family and other European rulers to advance her interests.</p><p>Elisabeth's death at the age of 37 was a great loss to her family and her court. She was mourned by many, including her daughter, who went on to lead a relatively quiet life as a nun. Elisabeth's legacy remains an important part of European history and culture, as she played a key role in shaping the Renaissance movement and promoting education and the arts.</p><p></p><p>
