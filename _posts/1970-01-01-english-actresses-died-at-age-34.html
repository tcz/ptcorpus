							Elsie Mackay was born to a wealthy family in Shimla, India, but was raised in England. She had a passion for acting and got her start in the industry at the age of 18, appearing in several stage productions. However, her true love was flying, and she became one of the first women to earn a pilot's license in the UK.</p><p>Mackay quickly gained a reputation as a skilled pilot, breaking several records for flying speed and altitude. She also designed and built her own aircraft, which she named "The Flier". In addition to her aviation pursuits, Mackay was also an accomplished interior designer, and her work was featured in several prestigious publications.</p><p>Tragically, Mackay's promising career was cut short when she attempted to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in 1928. She was last seen in her plane, the "Endeavour", on March 13th of that year, and is believed to have crashed into the ocean during her journey. Despite an extensive search effort, neither Mackay nor her plane were ever found.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=17637433" title="Wikipedia article about Elsie Mackay">Elsie Mackay on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Susan Littler</h2><p><strong>Susan Littler</strong>
