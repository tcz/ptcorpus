Today, he is considered one of the most influential Italian writers of the 20th century.</p><p>Quasimodo's love for poetry began at a young age, and he published his first collection, Acque e terre (Waters and Lands), in 1930. His works often focused on the themes of love, solitude, and the fragility of the human existence. In addition to poetry, Quasimodo also contributed to a number of literary reviews and newspapers, including Solaria, Letteratura, and Il Mondo. </p><p>During his lifetime, Quasimodo also worked as a translator, translating works by authors such as T.S. Eliot and James Joyce into Italian. He was recognized not only for his own poetry, but also for his contributions to literature as a translator and editor.</p><p>After the war, Quasimodo became increasingly involved in politics and supported the Italian Socialist Party. He was elected to the Italian Senate in 1964 and remained a member until his death in 1968. Despite his political involvement, Quasimodo never lost his passion for literature and continued writing until his death.</p><p></p><p>
