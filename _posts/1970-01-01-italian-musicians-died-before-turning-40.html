He eschewed the traditional idealized portrayals of religious figures in favor of a more raw and humanized depiction of saints and biblical characters.</p><p>Despite his success as an artist, Caravaggio's personal life was troubled. He was known for his violent temper and his penchant for getting into fights, and he was often involved in brawls and skirmishes with other artists and members of the public.</p><p>In 1606, Caravaggio's violent lifestyle caught up with him when he killed a man in a fight over a gambling debt. He was forced to flee Rome and spent the rest of his life on the run, moving between Naples, Malta, and Sicily.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced in his personal life, Caravaggio remained a prolific artist throughout his career. He produced a large number of masterpieces, including his famous paintings of Saint Matthew and The Conversion of Saint Paul.</p><p>Today, Caravaggio is widely regarded as one of the most important artists of the Baroque period, and his influence can be seen in the work of many subsequent artists. His innovations in chiaroscuro and his realistic approach to painting helped to shape the direction of European art in the years that followed.</p><p></p><p>
