He believed that Burkina Faso could achieve self-sufficiency and end its dependency on foreign aid. Sankara's policies focused on promoting local industries and agriculture, and he encouraged citizens to take a more active role in the development of their country.</p><p>Sankara's commitment to social justice and women's rights was evident in the policies that he introduced during his presidency. He increased the representation of women in government and ensured that girls had access to education. He also promoted family planning and made contraception widely available.</p><p>Outside Burkina Faso, Sankara was a well-respected figure in the Pan-Africanist movement. He advocated for the development of a strong African Union and opposed neo-colonialism and Western interference in African politics.</p><p>Despite his controversial policies and the criticism he received from some Western powers, Sankara remains a hero for many in Burkina Faso and across Africa.
