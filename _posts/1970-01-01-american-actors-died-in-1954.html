The strip followed the misadventures of an Irish-American couple named Jiggs and Maggie, and became one of the most widely syndicated comic strips of its time. In addition to his work on "Bringing Up Father," McManus also wrote and illustrated for several other newspapers and magazines throughout his career. He even had his own weekly radio show, "The George McManus Show," which aired in the 1930s. McManus' influence on the comic strip medium is still felt today, and he is viewed as a pioneer in the field of newspaper cartooning.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=3142590" title="Wikipedia article about George McManus">George McManus on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Carroll Gibbons</h2><p><strong>Carroll Gibbons</strong>

							Actually, Carroll Gibbons was not an American actor; he was an American-born musician and bandleader who became famous in the United Kingdom. He was born on January 4, 1903, in Clinton, Massachusetts, but his family moved to Canada when he was a child. Gibbons began playing piano professionally in the United States in the 1920s and eventually moved to England in 1924. There, he became a popular bandleader and was the director of the Savoy Hotel's famous dance band, the Savoy Orpheans, from 1926 to 1940. Gibbons became known for his smooth style and sophisticated arrangements, and his music was a huge hit with the British public. During World War II, he served as a captain in the British Army and entertained the troops with his music. After the war, he continued to perform and record, and he also appeared in several films. He passed away on May 10, 1954, at the age of 51.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=8881652" title="Wikipedia article about Carroll Gibbons">Carroll Gibbons on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/english-actors-died-at-age-46.html' title='English actors died at age 46'><strong>English actors died at age 46</strong> List of the top 3 English actors who died when they were 46</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-musicians-born-in-1954.html' title='Japanese musicians born in 1954'><strong>Japanese musicians born in 1954</strong> List of the top 23 Japanese  music stars who died in who were born in 1954</a></li><li><a href='/italian-actors-died-in-1982.html' title='Italian actors died in 1982'><strong>Italian actors died in 1982</strong> List of the top 9 Italian actors who died in 1982</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actors-born-in-1962.html' title='American actors born in 1962'><strong>American actors born in 1962</strong> List of the top 50 American actors who were born in 1962</a></li><li><a href='/turkish-actors-died-in-2006.html' title='Turkish actors died in 2006'><strong>Turkish actors died in 2006</strong> List of the top 3 Turkish actors who died in 2006</a></li><li><a href='/belgian-actors-died-at-age-50.html' title='Belgian actors died at age 50'><strong>Belgian actors died at age 50</strong> List of the top 1 Belgian actors who died when they were 50</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
