(December 22, 1892		Pula-August 27, 1929			Vienna)

	
		also known as Herman Potocnik or Hermann Noordung

	
was
a Croatian
scientist, engineer and aerospace engineer.


					</p><p>Herman Potočnik is best known for his book "The Problem of Space Travel", which he published in 1928 under the pseudonym "Hermann Noordung". This book was considered revolutionary at the time as it provided a comprehensive overview of space travel and the design of space stations. </p><p>Potočnik was a member of the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I and later worked as an engineer in Vienna. He was also involved in the development of the first liquid-fuel rocket engine. </p><p>Today, Potočnik is recognized as one of the pioneers of space exploration and his book remains relevant to the development of space stations and long-term space travel. In honor of his contributions, the Hermann Oberth Space Travel Museum in Feucht, Germany displays a replica of Potočnik's space station.</p><p>Despite his untimely death at the age of 36, Potočnik's impact on space exploration has continued to grow. In 1948, the International Astronomical Union named a crater on the moon after him, and in 1995, the asteroid 2079 Noordung was named in his honor. Additionally, his work inspired many scientists and engineers involved in the early days of space exploration, including Wernher von Braun, the German rocket scientist who played a key role in developing the rockets that took humans to the moon. Today, Potočnik's legacy lives on not only in the space stations and rockets that he helped design but also in the continued efforts of scientists and engineers from around the world to explore the mysteries of space.</p><p>Despite his short life, Herman Potočnik made significant contributions to the field of space exploration. He was a visionary who had the foresight to conceptualize space travel and space stations, which were later developed and built by others in the industry. Potočnik's book, "The Problem of Space Travel," is still considered a seminal work in the field of aerospace engineering and has inspired many scientists and engineers to pursue careers in space exploration. </p><p>Potočnik's legacy is particularly noteworthy given that he lived in a time when the concept of space travel was still largely considered science fiction. He was able to use his background in engineering and his experiences during the war to develop ideas that would eventually become a reality, even though he did not live to see it happen himself. </p><p>Beyond his contributions to space travel, Potočnik was also interested in other areas of science and technology. He was particularly interested in the use of liquid fuels and propulsion systems, which helped lay the foundation for modern rocket technology. </p><p>Today, Herman Potočnik is remembered as one of the pioneers of space exploration, and his contributions to the field continue to inspire and inform the work of scientists and engineers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
