(March 12, 1755-June 21, 1799)


was
a Belgian
personality.


					</p><p>Pieter Corbeels was a Belgian painter who specialized in portraits and history paintings. He was born in Antwerp, Flanders, and studied under the renowned artist Jan van Gool. Corbeels' work is known for its intricate details and attention to lighting and shading.</p><p>During his career, Corbeels painted portraits of many important figures, including members of the Austrian royal family and local aristocrats. He also received several commissions for large-scale history paintings, such as his piece depicting the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian.</p><p>Corbeels' career was cut short when he died at the age of 44. Despite his relatively short career, his works continue to be appreciated for their technical skill and historical significance. Today, his paintings can be found in private collections and museums around the world.</p><p>Before his death, Pieter Corbeels also spent time in Paris, where he impressed several prominent individuals with his artistic talents. He was offered membership to the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, but ultimately chose to return to Belgium to continue his work. Corbeels was also noted for his contributions to the local arts community, serving as a member of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke and participating in several exhibitions throughout his career. His legacy has continued beyond his death, with several posthumous exhibitions of his works being held in Belgium and the Netherlands in the years following his passing.</p><p></p><p>

(October 16, 1871-February 4, 1916)


was
a Belgian
conductor.


					</p><p>He studied composition at the Brussels Conservatory under Edgar Tinel and Martin-Joseph Mengal, and later he furthered his studies in conducting and orchestration under Fernand Kufferath. In 1902, Biarent was appointed conductor of the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie, one of the leading opera houses in Brussels. He conducted numerous productions at the Monnaie and also conducted concerts with the Société Philharmonique de Bruxelles. Biarent was also an accomplished composer and left behind a large body of works, including operas, orchestral and chamber music, and songs. Despite his promising career, Biarent's life was tragically cut short when he died at the age of 44 from a heart attack.</p><p>Biarent's operas were particularly well-regarded, with his successful work "Hulda" premiering in the Monnaie in 1903, and later being performed in other opera houses across Europe. He was known for his innovative approaches to composition, often incorporating local folk traditions into his works. In addition to his work as a conductor and composer, Biarent was also a dedicated teacher, and he taught composition and music theory at the Brussels Conservatory, where his students included the composer Joseph Jongen. Despite his relatively short career, Biarent is remembered as an important figure in Belgian music, and his contributions to the development of Belgian opera and concert music continue to be recognized today.</p><p></p><p>

(October 28, 1804		Brussels-February 15, 1849			Brussels)

	
		also known as Pierre Francois Verhulst

	
was
a Belgian
mathematician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on the logistic map, a model used in population dynamics. Verhulst studied mathematics and physics at the University of Ghent and later obtained his doctorate from the University of Liège. He worked as a mathematics teacher and also served as the director of an astronomical observatory in Brussels. Verhulst's most famous work, the logistic map, is a discrete-time dynamical system that models the growth of a population over time. The logistic map has been used in fields such as ecology, economics, and physics. In addition to his work on the logistic map, Verhulst made contributions to the theory of differential equations and the study of celestial mechanics.</p><p>Verhulst's mathematical work on the logistic map was not immediately recognized but gained wider recognition after being rediscovered by scientists in the 20th century. The logistic map is now regarded as a classic example of how simple mathematical models can have complex and surprising behavior. Verhulst also published several papers on the mechanics of comets and his research in this area helped in determining the paths of various comets. In 1841, he was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Belgium. Despite his contributions to mathematics and astronomy, Verhulst struggled to gain recognition and support during his lifetime. He died in poverty at the age of 44 in Brussels. Today, he is recognized as one of the most important Belgian mathematicians of the 19th century.</p><p></p><p>
