There, he was coerced by the Nazi authorities to create a propaganda film about life in the camp. Despite his misgivings, he complied and directed the film titled "The Führer Gives a City to the Jews."</p><p>After the filming was completed, Gerron and his wife were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where they were immediately put to death. The film he was forced to create ultimately became a haunting reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust.</p><p></p><p>
