(January 16, 1942		Montreal-)

	
		also known as Rene Angelil, René Angelil or Angelil, René

	
is
a Canadian
singer, talent manager and actor.


					
			
		He has
		six
		children,
		René-Charles Angelil, Nelson Angelil, Eddy Angelil, Patrick Angelil, Jean-Pierre Angelil and Anne-Marie Angelil.

							</p><p>Angélil began his career as a pop singer in the 1960s, and released several albums in his native Quebec. He later transitioned into management and became best known for discovering and guiding the career of Celine Dion. Angélil and Dion were married in 1994, and remained together until his death in 2016. In addition to Dion, Angélil managed the careers of several other successful Canadian musicians, including Ginette Reno and Rene Simard. In 2013, he was awarded the Order of Canada for his contributions to Canadian music. Angélil passed away on January 14, 2016 at the age of 73.</p><p>Angélil was born into a large Lebanese-Canadian family in Montreal, Quebec. As a teenager, he formed a pop rock group called Les Baronets with his friends, and they released several successful singles in French and English in the mid-1960s. However, by the end of the decade, the group had disbanded and Angélil turned his focus to talent management. </p><p>In the early 1980s, Angélil was introduced to a young singer named Celine Dion. He was immediately struck by her powerful voice and began managing her career, helping her to secure recording contracts in Canada and France. Together, they worked to develop her image and sound, and in 1990, Dion won the Eurovision Song Contest for Switzerland with the song "Ne partez pas sans moi," which Angélil had helped select and produce.</p><p>Angélil continued to guide Dion's career through the 1990s as she became one of the world's most successful and respected singers. In addition to managing her business affairs, Angélil acted as a mentor and friend to Dion, and they collaborated on many of her hit albums, including "Falling into You" and "Let's Talk About Love."</p><p>Throughout his career, Angélil remained a champion of Canadian music and worked to promote the careers of many up-and-coming artists. He was widely respected in the music industry for his talent and dedication, and he will be remembered as one of the most influential managers of his generation.</p><p>Angélil was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1999, and underwent several rounds of treatment over the years. Despite his illness, he continued to manage Dion's career and remained a fixture at her shows and public appearances. In 2013, he stepped down from his role as Dion's manager to focus on his health, but continued to provide guidance and support to the singer.</p><p>In addition to his work in the music industry, Angélil also had a career in acting. He appeared in several Quebecois television shows and films, including "La Florida" and "Lies My Father Told Me." He was also a co-founder of the Montreal-based gaming company Casino de Montreal.</p><p>Angélil's death in 2016 was met with an outpouring of grief from fans and colleagues around the world. Dion paid tribute to her late husband in a series of emotional performances, and dedicated her album "Courage" to him. Today, Angélil is remembered as a talented and dedicated music industry figure, and his legacy continues to be felt in the careers of the many artists he helped guide to success.</p><p></p><p>
