Today, he remains an influential figure in the British music scene and continues to inspire new generations of musicians.</p><p>One of the reasons why Al Doughty is so highly-regarded in the music industry is because of his innovative use of technology.

He has worked with the likes of Adrian Sherwood, Sinead O'Connor, and Paul Oakenfold, and has contributed to albums by artists such as The Shamen and EMF.</p><p>Doughty is also a keen advocate for the use of technology in music education. He has worked with schools and colleges in the UK and beyond to encourage young people to experiment with digital music-making tools, and has helped to develop a number of educational resources and programmes.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Doughty remains a humble and down-to-earth figure, always happy to chat with fans and fellow musicians alike. His dedication to his craft and his enthusiasm for new ideas have inspired countless musicians over the years, and his legacy is sure to endure for many years to come.</p><p>In addition to his music career, Al Doughty is also a trained electrical engineer.

His technical background has been an asset in his music career, allowing him to understand and incorporate new technologies into his work.</p><p>Doughty is also a passionate advocate for environmentalism and sustainability. He has spoken out about the need for musicians and the music industry to be more environmentally conscious, and has worked with organizations such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth on various campaigns.</p><p>In recent years, Doughty has reunited with Jesus Jones for various tours and live shows, much to the delight of fans. The band continues to be a beloved and influential part of the alternative rock genre, and Doughty's innovative bass playing style remains an inspiration to aspiring musicians around the world.</p><p></p><p>
