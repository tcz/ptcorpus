(February 9, 1895		Bolzano-May 17, 1930			Berlin)


was
an Austrian
physicist, scientist and writer.


					</p><p>He is credited with co-founding the German Society for Space Travel (VfR) in 1927, a precursor to the German rocket program. Valier was also a pioneer in the field of rocket propulsion and experimented with liquid-fueled rockets throughout his career. He authored numerous scientific papers and popular science books, including "The Advancement of Space Flight" and "The Road to the Stars." Sadly, Valier died at the age of 35 in an explosion during a rocket test in Berlin, cutting short his contributions to the field of space exploration.</p><p>Valier was passionate about rocket propulsion and researched and developed various liquid-fueled rockets throughout his career. In 1928, he successfully launched the first liquid-fueled rocket-powered car, the Valier-Heylandt Rak 7, achieving a top speed of 230 km/h (143 mph). He also collaborated with Fritz von Opel, grandson of the founder of the Opel car company, to develop rocket-powered aircrafts. </p><p>Valier was also a prolific inventor and held several patents, including a rocket-powered locomotive and a rocket-powered boat. He was a popular science writer and his books on space travel, rocket propulsion and astronomy were widely read and translated into several languages.</p><p>Despite his premature death, Valier's ideas, inventions and contributions to the field of rocket propulsion paved the way for the development of the German space program and space travel as we know it today.</p><p>Valier's interest in space travel began at a young age, and he often corresponded with early pioneers in the field such as Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. As a student at the University of Munich, Valier studied physics and developed a keen interest in rocket propulsion. He later worked as a research assistant for rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth, who would also become a co-founder of the VfR. </p><p>Valier's work with liquid-fueled rockets was groundbreaking and influential. His designs and experiments formed the basis for the rocket engines used in the V-2 missile during World War II. His rocket-powered car was also a precursor to today's jet-powered vehicles. </p><p>Though his life was cut tragically short, Valier's impact on rocket science and space travel was significant. He was a visionary, constantly exploring new ideas and possibilities for the future of space exploration. His legacy continues to inspire and influence scientists and space enthusiasts today.</p><p>Valier's contributions to the field of rocket propulsion earned him numerous accolades and recognition. He was awarded the Fritz von Opel Prize and the Grashof Commemorative Medal for his outstanding achievements in rocket technology in 1928. Valier was also a member of the International Astronautical Federation and the German Society for Aviation and Space Flight. In addition to his scientific work, Valier was also a prolific writer and journalist. He wrote regular columns for newspapers and magazines, including the influential Die Rakete (The Rocket), which was published by the VfR. Valier's writing popularized rocketry and space travel, making it accessible and intriguing to a wider audience. His contributions to space travel continue to inspire generations of scientists, engineers and space enthusiasts.</p><p></p><p>

(February 10, 1903		Kozlov-January 23, 1939			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>Matthias Sindelar was a renowned footballer who played for Austria at the international level. He is widely considered one of the greatest footballers in Austrian history, having scored 26 goals in just 43 appearances for the national team. Sindelar was known for his elegant playing style and technique, which earned him the nickname "The Mozart of Football". In club football, he played for several teams in Austria and Italy, including Austria Vienna and Napoli. Sindelar's tragic death in 1939 has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories, with some suggesting that he was deliberately poisoned by the Nazis due to his anti-fascist beliefs. Despite his untimely death, Sindelar's legacy lives on, and he remains an iconic figure in Austrian football and culture.</p><p>In addition to his success on the football pitch, Matthias Sindelar was also known for his strong anti-fascist beliefs. He refused to give the Nazi salute during a game against Germany in 1938, a move that earned him widespread admiration from both his teammates and the public. Sindelar was also known for his kindness and generosity off the field, and was known to frequently give money to those in need. Following his death in 1939, thousands of people attended his funeral to pay their respects to the beloved footballer. In 1998, he was posthumously awarded the Golden Order of Merit of the Republic of Austria for his contributions to Austrian football. Today, his image still adorns murals and monuments throughout Vienna, a testament to his enduring legacy in Austrian culture.</p><p>Matthias Sindelar was born in Kozlov, in what is now Ukraine, but was then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He came from a working-class background and began playing football at a young age. After showing promising talent, he was signed by Austria Vienna in 1924, where he quickly established himself as a star player.</p><p>In 1931, Sindelar and Austria Vienna won the Mitropa Cup, a prestigious club competition that was the forerunner to the modern-day Champions League. The following year, he helped Austria reach the semi-finals of the FIFA World Cup, where they were eventually knocked out by Italy.</p><p>Throughout his career, Sindelar was known for his creativity, speed, and technical ability. He was also a versatile player, able to play both as a forward and in midfield. His performances on the pitch made him a national hero in Austria, and he was widely regarded as one of the best players in the world during his heyday.</p><p>Tragically, Sindelar's life was cut short when he died in mysterious circumstances in 1939. His death came just months after Nazi Germany had annexed Austria, and some have suggested that his anti-fascist views may have made him a target for the regime. However, the true cause of his death remains unclear.</p><p>Despite the sadness of his premature passing, Matthias Sindelar's legacy endures. He is remembered as a footballing genius and a symbol of resistance against fascism. Every year, the Austrian football league awards the "Matthias Sindelar Prize" to the player who has made the greatest contribution to the league over the course of the season. His story continues to inspire new generations of football fans and anti-fascist activists alike.</p><p>This is a common belief nowadays, but it wasn't until 2009 that forensic experts declared carbon monoxide poisoning as the definitive cause of his death. It is believed that Sindelar's death was an accident, resulting from a faulty stove in his apartment. Though the truth about Sindelar's death may be less sensational than some of the conspiracy theories suggest, his legacy as a footballing icon and anti-fascist hero remains as strong as ever. His unique, elegant playing style and unwavering commitment to his principles have earned him a place in footballing history, not just in Austria, but around the world.</p><p></p><p>
