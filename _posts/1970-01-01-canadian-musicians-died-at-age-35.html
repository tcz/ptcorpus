(December 1, 1910		Winnipeg-May 30, 1946			Los Alamos)


was
a Canadian
physicist and chemist.


					</p><p>Slotin was a member of the Manhattan Project, the secret research project that developed the first nuclear weapons during World War II. He was known for his expertise in the workings of nuclear weapons, and he had a reputation for being a risk-taker. </p><p>On May 21, 1946, Slotin was performing a demonstration of an experiment with a core of enriched uranium for colleagues at Los Alamos. The experiment involved manually bringing two halves of a beryllium-coated plutonium sphere together with a screwdriver, which would initiate a chain reaction. However, Slotin's screwdriver slipped, causing the halves to come too close together and triggering a burst of radiation.</p><p>Slotin immediately pushed the halves apart with his bare hands, exposing himself and seven other people in the room to deadly levels of radiation. He died nine days later from radiation poisoning. </p><p>The incident, known as the "Louis Slotin accident," was one of the worst nuclear accidents in history and led to significant changes in the safety protocols for handling nuclear materials. Slotin received a posthumous award for courage and heroism from the U.S. Army.</p><p>In addition to his work on the Manhattan Project, Louis Slotin also made significant contributions to the field of cosmic rays, the high-energy particles that originate from space. He was part of a team that studied these particles using balloons launched into the stratosphere. Slotin also worked on the development of the first nuclear reactors and helped to design the first reactor to produce electricity. Slotin was highly regarded by his colleagues for his experimental skills and his ability to think creatively about complex problems. After his death, a memorial plaque was placed in his honor at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he had worked. The plaque reads, "In memory of Louis Alexander Slotin, who sacrificed his life, July 1946, so that his colleagues might live." The incident involving Slotin's death was later dramatized in the play and movie "The Manhattan Project."</p><p>Louis Slotin was born to Jewish immigrants who had moved to Canada from Ukraine. He showed an early interest in science and went on to study chemistry and physics at the University of Manitoba. After completing his undergraduate degree, he went on to earn a Master's degree in chemistry from King's College in London. Slotin then returned to Canada and began teaching at the University of Manitoba, where he worked on research related to nuclear physics.</p><p>In 1943, Slotin was recruited to join the Manhattan Project and was sent to work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. He quickly became known for his skill in handling nuclear materials and was soon put in charge of overseeing critical experiments related to the development of the atomic bomb.</p><p>Despite his reputation as a risk-taker, Slotin was also known for his devotion to safety. He frequently spoke out against unsafe practices and was responsible for implementing several safety measures that saved lives during the Manhattan Project.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Slotin was also a talented musician and a passionate advocate for social justice. He was an outspoken critic of racism and discrimination and was known for using his platform as a scientist to speak out against injustice.</p><p>Despite the tragic circumstances of his death, Slotin's contributions to the development of the atomic bomb and nuclear technology continue to be remembered and celebrated by scientists and historians alike. His legacy serves as a powerful reminder of the dangers inherent in nuclear research and the importance of safety and responsibility in scientific exploration.</p><p></p><p>
