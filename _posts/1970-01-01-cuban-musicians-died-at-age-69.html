(January 16, 1882		Matanzas-September 3, 1951			Havana)


was
a Cuban
composer.


					</p><p>She was part of the Lecuona family, a musical dynasty that included many accomplished musicians and composers. Ernestina herself composed over 400 works, including zarzuelas, operettas, and songs.</p><p>Ernestina was also a passionate advocate for women's rights and was involved in various organizations promoting female empowerment in Cuba. In recognition of her contributions to Cuban culture and society, she was posthumously awarded the Order of Cultural Merit by the Cuban government in 2014.</p><p>Despite her achievements, Ernestina's music remains relatively unknown today, overshadowed by the more famous works of her brother and fellow composer Ernesto Lecuona. However, recent efforts have been made to revive and celebrate Ernestina's music and legacy in Cuba and beyond.</p><p>Ernestina Lecuona y Casado was born into a family of musicians and composers in Matanzas, Cuba. She showed a natural aptitude for music from an early age and began composing her own pieces as a teenager. Her brother, Ernesto Lecuona, was already an established composer at the time, and Ernestina often collaborated with him on projects.</p><p>Ernestina's music was heavily influenced by Cuban and Spanish folk traditions, but she also incorporated elements of classical music into her compositions. Her work was well-received in Cuba during her lifetime, but she did not gain the same level of international recognition as her brother did.</p><p>In addition to her musical career, Ernestina was a vocal advocate for women's rights and was involved in several organizations promoting female education and empowerment. She was a member of the Havana branch of the International Women's Suffrage Alliance and founded the Association of Cuban Women to promote gender equality in her home country.</p><p>Ernestina passed away in Havana in 1951, but her contributions to Cuban music and society have continued to be celebrated. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in her work, and several recordings of her music have been released. Today, she is remembered as a pioneer for women in music and an accomplished composer in her own right.</p><p>Ernestina Lecuona y Casado's legacy is being preserved by the Ernestina Lecuona Music Collection, which was established to promote her music and provide educational opportunities for young musicians in Cuba. The collection includes recordings, sheet music, and other materials related to Ernestina's life and work. Additionally, the Association of Women in Music has recognized her contributions with a research grant in her name.</p><p>Ernestina was also an accomplished pianist and frequently performed her own compositions in concert. She was known for her virtuosity and technical skill on the piano, which was a novelty for female musicians in her time.</p><p>Despite the challenges she faced as a woman composer in a male-dominated field, Ernestina remained committed to her craft and her advocacy work. She was also a devoted mother and raised four children while continuing to pursue her career.</p><p>Ernestina's influence can be heard in the work of other Cuban composers, such as Amadeo Roldán and José Ardévol, who were part of the same wave of Cuban modernism in the early 20th century. Her music and activism continue to inspire new generations of artists and feminists in Cuba and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
