an Argentine
lawyer.


					</p><p>He served as the president of Argentina from March 5 to October 5, 1860. Derqui's term as president was brief and marked by political instability and conflict between the central government and the provinces. During his presidency, he faced a rebellion by Buenos Aires Province, which refused to acknowledge his authority and eventually seceded from the rest of Argentina. After leaving the presidency, Derqui continued to work as a lawyer and played a role in Argentine politics, serving as a senator and later as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. Despite his brief tenure as president, Derqui is remembered as an important figure in Argentine history and a champion of the rule of law.</p><p>Derqui studied at the National University of Córdoba and began his legal career as a clerk in a local court. He later became a well-respected lawyer and was known for his defense of the rights of the provinces in the face of centralized power.</p><p>Derqui was a firm believer in democracy and represented a moderate wing of the Argentine political establishment. He was chosen as president in 1860 as a compromise candidate, with the hope that he could bring stability to the country after a period of political turmoil.</p><p>Despite his efforts, Derqui's presidency was plagued by conflict and unrest. His attempts to enforce central authority were met with resistance from several provincial governments, including Buenos Aires. The central government's response to this rebellion was marked by violence and repression, further exacerbating tensions with the provinces.</p><p>After leaving office, Derqui continued to work as a lawyer and remained active in politics. He was a strong supporter of constitutional reform and worked towards a more stable and unified Argentina. Despite his efforts, the country remained divided for many years, with periodic outbreaks of violence and political unrest.</p><p>Today, Derqui is remembered as a key figure in Argentine history and an advocate for democratic values and the rule of law. His legacy reminds us of the importance of compromise, respect for diversity, and the pursuit of justice and stability in times of political turmoil.</p><p></p><p>
