(April 5, 2015		Switzerland-April 5, 1984)


was
a Swiss
architect.


					</p><p>Hoesli was also an influential educator, writer, and painter, known for his contributions to modernist architecture and design. He played a significant role in the development of the popular architectural design movement, the Bauhaus, which emerged in Germany in the early 20th century. His innovative approach to architectural design emphasized the importance of form, texture, and light, and he believed that architecture should be responsive to the needs of its occupants. Hoesli's ideas had a considerable influence on the development of modernist architecture, and his work continues to be studied and celebrated by architects and designers today. In addition to his architectural work, Hoesli was also an accomplished painter, and his artworks are featured in many prestigious galleries and collections around the world.</p><p>Hoesli was born in Switzerland and began his architectural career in the 1950s after studying both in Switzerland and the United States. His work as an educator was just as important as his work as an architect, as he taught at several prestigious institutions, including the University of Texas at Austin and the ETH Zurich. Hoesli's philosophy on architectural design was heavily influenced by his background in painting, and he often used his artistic skills to help students understand the importance of color, texture, and form in their designs. In his later years, he became increasingly interested in the role of nature in architectural design, and he explored ideas related to sustainability and environmentalism. Today, Hoesli is remembered as an important figure in the world of modernist architecture, and his contributions to the field continue to inspire architects and designers around the world.</p><p>Hoesli was known for his collaboration with famed architect Le Corbusier, having worked on notable projects such as the Swiss Pavilion at the 1937 Paris World's Fair. His approach to architecture was also heavily influenced by his experiences traveling and studying different cultures, with a particular focus on the traditional architecture of North Africa and the Near East. Hoesli's writing on architecture and design was also highly regarded, and he contributed to several books and journals throughout his career. He passed away in 1984 at the age of 69, but his legacy as a visionary architect and educator continues to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>In addition to his work as an architect and educator, Bernhard Hoesli was also a prolific writer. He contributed to several books and journals throughout his career, including the influential publication, "The New Landscape". In this work, Hoesli explored the relationship between architecture and landscape, and he advocated for architecture that was sensitive to the natural environment. Hoesli's writing on architecture and design was highly regarded, and he is still widely read and referenced in academic and professional circles today.</p><p>Throughout his career, Hoesli was dedicated to the idea that architecture should be responsive to the needs of its occupants. He was particularly interested in the ways that architecture could improve people's lives, and he believed that good design had the power to create more equitable and sustainable societies. Hoesli's ideas and philosophies continue to be influential in the field of architecture, and his legacy as a visionary designer and educator remains strong to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 2015-April 5, 1984)

	
		also known as Julius Richard Buchi

	
was
a Swiss
mathematician.


					</p><p>He was born in Switzerland in 1916, and became interested in mathematics at a young age. After receiving his PhD in mathematics from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, he went on to work for the Swiss Federal Railways, where he became known for his work in operations research.</p><p>Büchi is particularly well-known for his work on automata theory, which helped lay the groundwork for modern computer science. He developed the concept of the Buchi automaton, which is still used today in the study of formal languages and automata.</p><p>Later in his career, Büchi became a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He continued to make important contributions to the field of automata theory, and is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of theoretical computer science.</p><p>Büchi passed away in 1984 at the age of 68, but his contributions to the field of computer science continue to be recognized and celebrated to this day.</p><p>In addition to his work on automata theory, Julius Richard Büchi also made significant contributions to the field of formal verification. He developed some of the earliest techniques for verifying the correctness of digital circuits, and his work laid the foundations for the field of model checking. Model checking is now widely used to verify the correctness of complex digital systems, such as microprocessors, software systems, and communication protocols.</p><p>Büchi received many honors and awards for his contributions to mathematics and computer science, including the prestigious Turing Award in 1986. This award, often referred to as the "Nobel Prize of computing," is given to individuals who have made significant contributions to the field of computer science.</p><p>Today, Büchi's legacy lives on through the many researchers and scientists who continue to build upon his work. His contributions to automata theory and formal verification helped shape the field of computer science and laid the foundation for modern computing.</p><p>In addition to his important work in computer science and mathematics, Julius Richard Büchi was also known for his passion for music. He was a skilled violinist and often played in chamber music groups throughout his life. Büchi was also an avid collector of rare and antique violins, and his collection was considered one of the most impressive in the world at the time of his death. In his honor, the Julius R. Büchi Fellowship was established by the University of Illinois to support graduate students in computer science who demonstrate exceptional academic achievement and a passion for music. Büchi's multidisciplinary approach to his work and his dedication to both the arts and sciences continue to inspire students and researchers today.</p><p>Julius Richard Büchi was born in Zurich, Switzerland to a family of intellectuals. His father was a famous historian, and his mother was a trained pianist. From an early age, Büchi showed a great aptitude for mathematics and music. By the time he was in high school, he was already taking postgraduate level courses in mathematics, and he had already begun to perform publicly as a violinist.</p><p>Büchi enrolled at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich in 1934 to pursue his PhD in mathematics. In addition to his studies, he continued to play the violin and joined several chamber music groups. After completing his PhD, he took a job at the Swiss Federal Railways, where he was able to apply his knowledge of mathematics to the optimization of train schedules and operations.</p><p>His work on automata theory began in the mid-1950s and culminated in the development of the Buchi automaton in 1960. The Buchi automaton is a type of finite state machine that recognizes a certain type of formal language. Büchi's work had a significant impact on the development of computer science and helped pave the way for the creation of modern computing systems.</p><p>Later in his career, Büchi moved to the United States, where he became a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He continued to make important contributions to the field of automata theory and also developed techniques for formal verification.</p><p>Büchi's contributions to both mathematics and computer science did not go unnoticed. He was awarded the Turing Award in 1986, which is considered the highest honor in the field of computer science. In addition, he was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize in 1978, the W. Wallace McDowell Award in 1979, and the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award in 1982.  </p><p>Büchi passed away in 1984 at the age of 68, but his contributions to the field of computer science continue to be celebrated to this day. His multidisciplinary approach to his work, which combined his passions for mathematics, music, and engineering, serves as an inspiration for aspiring scientists and researchers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
