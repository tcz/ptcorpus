							Jannings was considered one of the greatest actors of the silent and early sound film eras. He won the first Academy Award for Best Actor in 1929 for his roles in "The Last Command" and "The Way of All Flesh." Jannings continued to appear in German and international films throughout the 1930s, including "The Blue Angel" with Marlene Dietrich. However, his association with the Nazi Party and his acting in propaganda films during World War II caused his career to decline. After the war, he was blacklisted by Hollywood and returned to Europe where he acted in several films. Despite his controversial political views, Jannings's acting ability was praised by critics and has influenced actors to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=106405" title="Wikipedia article about Emil Jannings">Emil Jannings on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/czech-actors-died-at-age-55.html' title='Czech actors died at age 55'><strong>Czech actors died at age 55</strong> List of the top 1 Czech actors who died when they were 55</a></li><li><a href='/mexican-musicians-died-in-cholera.html' title='Mexican musicians died in Cholera'><strong>Mexican musicians died in Cholera</strong> List of the top 1 Mexican music stars who died in Cholera</a></li><li><a href='/south-korean-musicians-died-at-age-71.html' title='South Korean musicians died at age 71'><strong>South Korean musicians died at age 71</strong> List of the top 6 South Korean music stars who died when they were 71</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/spanish-actors-died-at-age-79.html' title='Spanish actors died at age 79'><strong>Spanish actors died at age 79</strong> List of the top 10 Spanish actors who died when they were 79</a></li><li><a href='/danish-actors-died-in-renal-failure.html' title='Danish actors died in Renal failure'><strong>Danish actors died in Renal failure</strong> List of the top 1 Danish actors who died in Renal failure</a></li><li><a href='/turkish-actors-born-in-1949.html' title='Turkish actors born in 1949'><strong>Turkish actors born in 1949</strong> List of the top 5 Turkish actors who were born in 1949</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
