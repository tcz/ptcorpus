(February 7, 1975		Iran-March 16, 2005)


was
an Iranian
personality.


					</p><p>Mohammed Bijeh, also known as the "Tehran Desert Vampire," was a notorious serial killer who terrorized the rural outskirts of Tehran between 2002 and 2004. He and his accomplice, Ali Baghi, were responsible for the brutal murders of at least 16 boys and teenagers, all of whom the duo lured into the desert with promises of money and work.</p><p>Bijeh and Baghi were finally apprehended and confessed to their crimes, leading to their eventual execution in 2005. Bijeh's case drew widespread attention as it highlighted the issue of child abuse and sexual violence in Iran, which had previously been taboo topics.</p><p>Despite his heinous crimes, Bijeh remains a subject of fascination in popular culture, with numerous books and films based on his life and actions. His legacy remains controversial, with some arguing that his execution was justified, while others argue that it was a violation of human rights.</p><p>Mohammed Bijeh was born on February 7, 1975, in Iran. He grew up in a poor family and dropped out of school at a young age. Prior to his arrest, he worked odd jobs and was known to have a temperamental personality. Bijeh's criminal career began in his early 20s when he was convicted of raping a teenage boy and sent to prison for six years. After his release, he began his spree of murders with accomplice Ali Baghi. </p><p>Bijeh and Baghi's modus operandi included luring young boys and teenagers from poor families with promises of work and money before taking them to the desert and brutally murdering them. They often used daggers and other sharp objects to kill their victims. The duo's gruesome crimes gained widespread attention and created panic among the community. </p><p>After several failed attempts to catch Bijeh and Baghi, the Iranian police finally captured them in 2004. Bijeh initially denied involvement in the murders, but his DNA was later found at the murder scenes, leading to his eventual confession. He and Baghi were sentenced to death and hanged on March 16, 2005. </p><p>Bijeh's case remains a symbol of Iran's struggle to address child abuse and sexual violence. The public outrage over his crimes led to changes in the country's legal system and sparked important discussions about these taboo topics. Despite his execution, Bijeh's infamy has continued to fascinate people, and his story has inspired numerous books and films.</p><p>In the aftermath of Bijeh's crimes, there was significant debate around his mental state and the potential reasons for his actions. Some argued that his troubled upbringing and lack of opportunity may have contributed to his violent tendencies, while others pointed to the possibility of undiagnosed mental illness. The case also raised questions about Iran's death penalty, with some arguing that Bijeh and Baghi should have been given life imprisonment instead. Despite the controversies surrounding his legacy, there is no denying the impact that Bijeh had on Iranian society, both in terms of the devastating loss of life he caused and the conversations his case sparked around issues of abuse and violence.</p><p>After Bijeh's execution, his family faced backlash and condemnation from the community. His father was forced to move out of their village, and their family members were harassed and stigmatized. Bijeh's mother, who had initially denied her son's involvement in the murders, later publicly apologized to the victims' families and expressed her grief over her son's actions. She has since become an advocate for victims' rights in Iran.In 2007, director Samira Makhmalbaf released a film titled "Two-Legged Horse," which was loosely based on Bijeh's story. The film was met with controversy and criticism, with some arguing that it glorified a serial killer. Despite the backlash, "Two-Legged Horse" was screened at several international film festivals and received critical acclaim.Bijeh's case remains one of the most notorious instances of serial murder in Iranian history. His crimes exposed the dark underbelly of poverty and desperation in rural Iran and sparked important conversations around abuse, violence, and mental health in the country.</p><p></p><p>
