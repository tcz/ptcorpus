(May 17, 1888		Lewisham-January 28, 1965			Bearsted)


was
an English
personality.


					</p><p>He was a professional cricketer who was widely regarded as one of the greatest spin bowlers of all time. Freeman played for Kent County Cricket Club for over two decades, taking over 3,700 wickets in first-class cricket, including a record 304 in the 1928 season. He also played 12 Test matches for England, taking 66 wickets at an average of 25.86. Freeman was known for his exceptional accuracy and subtle variations of pace and spin, which allowed him to deceive and outfox the best batsmen of his era. In addition to his cricketing achievements, Freeman was also a keen ornithologist and wrote several books on birds, as well as serving as president of the RSPB.</p><p>Freeman was born in Lewisham, south London, in 1888, and began playing cricket at a young age. He made his debut for Kent in 1914, but his career was interrupted by World War I, during which he served in the British Army. Freeman returned to county cricket in 1919 and quickly established himself as one of the best spin bowlers in the game. His performances for Kent earned him a place in the England team, and he made his Test debut against South Africa in 1929.</p><p>Freeman's best year came in 1928, when he took a remarkable 304 wickets in county cricket. This remains a record for the most wickets taken in a single season in first-class cricket. His success was due in part to his mastery of the "googly", a delivery that spins in the opposite direction to a leg break, and which he used to great effect throughout his career.</p><p>Off the field, Freeman was a keen birdwatcher and conservationist. He wrote several books on birds, including "Birds of Kent" and "The Book of Bird Life", and served as president of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) from 1947 to 1951.</p><p>Freeman retired from cricket in 1936 and was awarded the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his services to the sport. He passed away in Bearsted, Kent, in 1965, at the age of 76. Today, he is remembered as one of the all-time greats of English cricket, and his record of 3,776 first-class wickets is unlikely to be surpassed.</p><p></p><p>
