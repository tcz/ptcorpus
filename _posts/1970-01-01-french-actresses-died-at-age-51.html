She was a popular model for both photography and painting, and her striking looks and adventurous lifestyle made her a well-known figure in the bohemian circle of artists, writers and intellectuals that frequented the cafes of Montparnasse. Kiki herself was also a creative force, producing her own paintings, poetry and music, and later in life she wrote an autobiography that provided a fascinating window into the vibrant cultural scene of early 20th-century Paris.
