(December 3, 1645-October 13, 1705)


was
a Polish
personality.


					</p><p>Radziejowski was a prominent figure during the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, serving as the Archbishop of Gniezno and the Primate of Poland. He was known for his political influence and for his support of the reforms that King John III Sobieski sought to implement in the country. Radziejowski was also a strong advocate for the rights of the church and was involved in several controversies with the Polish monarchy over church privileges. In addition to his religious and political activities, he was also a noted scholar, completing several works on theology and philosophy. He was canonized by the Catholic Church in 1999.</p><p>Radziejowski was born into a wealthy noble family near Poznań, Poland. He received his education at the Kraków Academy, where he later became a professor of philosophy and theology. In 1675 he was appointed Bishop of Chełmno, and in 1690 he was appointed Archbishop of Gniezno, which made him Primate of Poland. As Primate, he played a key role in the negotiations leading up to the election of King Augustus II the Strong in 1697. </p><p>Radziejowski is perhaps best known for his participation in the strife between the church and the state in Poland. He was a strong proponent of the primacy of the church and saw the monarchy as a potential threat to this principle. In 1695, he became embroiled in a dispute with King John III Sobieski over the right to appoint bishops. The dispute was eventually settled in favor of the monarch and marked a significant loss of power for the church. </p><p>Radziejowski's religious writings were highly regarded during his lifetime and continue to be studied today. He was a prolific writer, producing works on a variety of topics, including theology, philosophy, and moral and political philosophy. His best-known works include "Causa Dei," a treatise on the nature of God, and "De Homine," a work on the nature of humanity. </p><p>Today, Radziejowski is remembered as a significant figure in Polish history, particularly for his role as a powerful advocate for the Roman Catholic Church during a time of great change in the country. His canonization in 1999 was seen as recognition of his contributions to Polish religious and intellectual culture.</p><p>He was also known for his philanthropic work, particularly in his support of education. Radziejowski was instrumental in establishing several schools, including the Gniezno Academy, which later became the University of Poznań. He believed that education was key to the development of the individual and to the progress of the country as a whole. His efforts to promote education earned him widespread admiration and respect.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Radziejowski's later years were marked by controversy and political intrigue. He was accused of conspiring with the Swedish army during their invasion of Poland in 1704 and was arrested by the authorities. He was later released, but his reputation suffered greatly as a result of the accusations. He died the following year, leaving behind a rich and complex legacy that continues to be studied and debated by scholars today.</p><p></p><p>

(November 2, 1879		Lypovets Raion-April 3, 1939			Warsaw)


was
a Polish
politician.


					</p><p>Sławek was an important figure in the politics of the Second Polish Republic. He served as the Prime Minister of Poland from 1935 until 1936, and also held the post of Minister of Internal Affairs. He was a member of the conservative National Party and was known for his strong nationalist views. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the controversial 1936 "Small Constitution" which limited the power of the Sejm and strengthened the role of the President. After resigning from his position, Sławek remained active in politics but was increasingly marginalized due to his close association with the authoritarian regime of President Ignacy Mościcki. In 1939, as World War II loomed on the horizon and Poland faced increasing pressure from Germany and the Soviet Union, Sławek took his own life. His suicide was seen as a symbol of the growing desperation and instability of the Polish political establishment in the face of external threats. Today, Sławek is remembered not only as a controversial politician, but also as a tragic figure caught up in the tumultuous events of his time.</p><p>Despite the controversies and criticisms surrounding his political career, it is important to note that Walery Sławek was also a respected lawyer and legal scholar. He earned a degree in law from the University of Lwów in 1905 and went on to become a professor of law at the same university. He was known for his expertise in commercial law and was widely regarded as one of the leading legal minds in Poland. In addition to his political and academic work, Sławek also served as a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and was a prolific writer, publishing numerous articles and books on a wide range of legal and political issues. Despite the tragic circumstances of his death, his contributions to legal scholarship and his role in shaping the political landscape of interwar Poland ensure that his legacy endures to this day.</p><p>Sławek's political career was not without controversy. He was often criticized for his authoritarian tendencies and for his support of the Sanation regime led by President Mościcki. Sławek believed in a strong, centralized government and was a vocal opponent of the parliamentary system, which he felt was too slow and indecisive. His role in the passage of the 1936 "Small Constitution" was seen by many as an attempt to consolidate power in the hands of the President and limit the influence of the Sejm.</p><p>Despite these criticisms, Sławek remained a popular figure among many segments of Polish society, particularly among the country's large landowning class. His nationalist views and his support for a strong, independent Poland resonated with many Poles who were deeply committed to their country's sovereignty.</p><p>Today, Sławek is remembered as a complex figure whose political legacy is still being debated by historians and scholars. Some see him as a visionary leader who was ahead of his time, while others view him as a dangerous authoritarian who helped pave the way for the rise of the far right in Poland. Regardless of one's perspective, there is no denying that Sławek played an important role in shaping the political landscape of interwar Poland and that his contributions to legal scholarship continue to be highly valued in academic circles.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in suicide.
