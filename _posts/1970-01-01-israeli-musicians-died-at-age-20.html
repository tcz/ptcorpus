					</p><p>Moi Ver was born in Vilnius, Lithuania in 1904 to a Jewish family. He studied art and photography in Germany, and later moved to Paris where he began working as a freelance photographer for several magazines. His style was influenced by the avant-garde movements of the early 20th century, which he blended with his own unique vision to create striking images that captured the spirit of the times.</p><p>In 1929, Moi Ver moved to Tel Aviv, Israel, where he continued to work as a photographer and artist. He was a founding member of the New Horizons art group, which paved the way for modern art in Israel. Moi Ver's photographs and paintings were exhibited in many international exhibitions, and are now regarded as some of the most important works of Israeli art from the mid-20th century.</p><p>Throughout his career, Moi Ver experimented with different photographic techniques, including solarization, double exposure, and montage. He believed in the power of photography to capture the essence of a moment, and his images often have a dreamlike, surreal quality.</p><p>Moi Ver passed away on his 91st birthday in 1995, but his legacy as a pioneer of Israeli art and photography continues to inspire and influence artists around the world.</p><p>In addition to his work as a photographer and artist, Moi Ver was also a filmmaker. He directed several experimental films in the early 1930s, which were considered groundbreaking at the time. He also designed sets and costumes for theater productions in Tel Aviv, and worked as an art director for Israeli cinema. </p><p>Moi Ver's photography focused on both the beauty of the natural world and the struggles of everyday life. His images of Tel Aviv captured the city's early development and growth, while his portraits of Israeli people and landscapes revealed a deep connection to his subjects. </p><p>In 1974, Moi Ver was awarded the Israel Prize for art, one of the country's highest honors. The award recognized his significant contribution to Israeli culture, and his role in shaping the country's artistic identity. Today, Moi Ver's work is held in prestigious collections around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.</p><p>Moi Ver was deeply committed to social justice and equality, and his photography often reflected this passion. In the 1930s, he documented the harsh living conditions of Jewish immigrants living in Tel Aviv's slums, using his camera to highlight the struggles of these marginalized communities. Moi Ver also photographed the construction of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline in the 1940s, which brought oil from Iraq to the Mediterranean. His images of the workers building the pipeline captured the grueling labor and extreme conditions they endured. Moi Ver's ability to capture the human experience in his photography earned him widespread acclaim, and his legacy continues to inspire artists and documentarians today.</p><p></p><p>
