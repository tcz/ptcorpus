					</p><p>Moustapha Choukri was a writer, poet and playwright who gained international recognition for his literary contributions. He spent most of his young adult life in Tangier, where he worked various jobs, including those of a messenger and a cook, before moving to Spain in the early 1970s.</p><p>His literary works, which were generally autobiographical in nature, often explored the themes of drug addiction, poverty, and marginalization in Moroccan society. Some of his most notable works include "For Bread Alone," "The Stars of Tangier," and "Streetwise."</p><p>Choukriâ€™s works have been translated into several languages and have been well-received by critics around the world. His contributions to modern Arabic literature continue to inspire new generations of writers and poets.</p><p>Choukri was raised in extreme poverty and did not attend school until the age of 15. He became literate through his own efforts, reading newspapers and books from the streets. He later became associated with the Beat Generation, as his writing reflected their themes of alienation, drug use and wandering. Choukri's work was also heavily influenced by his experiences as a political activist and a labourer. Despite facing censorship and ban in several Arab countries, Choukri's work found a wide readership among young people, who related to his frank portrayal of the realities of life in poverty. Today, Choukri is remembered as one of the most influential writers of his generation, whose work continues to inspire social and political change.</p><p>In addition to his literary contributions, Moustapha Choukri was also known for his advocacy of human rights, particularly for Moroccan migrant workers in Europe. He was a vocal critic of the Moroccan government's treatment of its citizens and spoke out against the injustices he witnessed in his country. Later in life, Choukri also became involved in film, serving as an actor and writer for several films, including the adaptation of his own novel, "For bread alone." Despite his success and growing international recognition, Choukri remained humble and committed to his craft, continuing to write until his death in 2003. Today, Moustapha Choukri's legacy lives on, inspiring writers and activists around the world to continue speaking truth to power and fighting for a more just society.</p><p></p><p>
