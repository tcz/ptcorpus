(January 1, 1970		Athens-April 5, 2015			Kalaureia)


was
a Greek
politician.


					</p><p>Demosthenes was widely considered one of the greatest orators and statesmen in ancient Greece. He played a crucial role in the political events of Athens during the fourth century BCE, particularly during the Macedonian Wars. Demosthenes was known for his stirring speeches and formidable intelligence, and he dedicated much of his life to advocating for an independent and free Athens. Despite facing numerous setbacks and political enemies, he remained a beloved and influential figure among the people. Demosthenes' works still resonate in the modern world as examples of powerful rhetoric and enduring political ideals.</p><p>Demosthenes was born into a wealthy Athenian family in 384 BCE. His father died when he was just seven years old, leaving him and his siblings in their mother's care. However, his mother died soon after, leaving him and his siblings under the guardianship of their uncle, Demophon. Demosthenes received an outstanding education and was trained in rhetoric, which became his primary interest.</p><p>Demosthenes was drawn to politics at an early age and began speaking at the Athenian Assembly when he was just 18 years old. However, his early speeches were poorly received, and he struggled to gain the respect of the Athenian people. Undeterred, Demosthenes began working diligently to improve his oratorical skills, using speech therapy techniques such as speaking with pebbles in his mouth to overcome a stutter.</p><p>Despite numerous setbacks, Demosthenes continued to speak out in favor of Athenian independence and against the growing influence of Macedonia. His most famous speech, the Philippics, was a series of orations in which he denounced the Macedonian king, Philip II, and urged the Athenians to resist him. This speech became so influential that the term "philippic" is now used to describe any scathing attack on a political leader.</p><p>Despite his tireless efforts on behalf of Athens, Demosthenes often found himself at odds with other Athenian politicians. He was accused of bribery and corruption on several occasions and was forced to go into exile to avoid punishment. Nevertheless, he remained committed to his ideals and was eventually pardoned and allowed to return to Athens.</p><p>In the final years of his life, Demosthenes' political fortunes declined. After the death of Alexander the Great, Athens was caught up in a power struggle between Macedonia and other Greek states. Demosthenes was accused of collaborating with the Persian empire, and rather than face trial, he chose to take his own life by drinking poison.</p><p>Today, Demosthenes is remembered as one of the greatest orators and statesmen in ancient Greece. His speeches and writings have been studied for centuries and continue to inspire political activists and leaders around the world.</p><p>In addition to his political activities, Demosthenes was also an accomplished writer. He wrote speeches, letters, and treatises on a wide range of topics, including law, politics, and philosophy. His works are known for their clarity, cogency, and powerful arguments.</p><p>Demosthenes' influence extended far beyond his native Athens. He was admired by the ancient Romans for his skill in public speaking, and his works were studied and imitated by many of the great orators and statesmen of the Roman Empire. In later centuries, his speeches and writings continued to be held in high regard, and he was widely considered one of the founding fathers of Western political thought.</p><p>Today, Demosthenes is still revered for his contributions to the field of rhetoric and his dedication to the cause of Athenian freedom. His legacy lives on in the art of public speaking, which continues to be studied and practiced around the world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of suicide.

		also known as Kleomenes

	
was
a Greek
personality.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Gorgo, Queen of Sparta.

						</p><p>Cleomenes I was born in the 6th century BC and was a king of Sparta. He is known for his military campaigns and reforms in Sparta. During his reign, he sought to strengthen the position of the king in Sparta and diminish the power of the ephors, the council of five elected officials who shared power with the king. </p><p>In 510 BC, Cleomenes led a successful campaign against the city of Argos and secured an alliance with the Achaemenid Empire. He also attempted to reform the social and economic structure of Sparta, including measures such as the cancellation of debts and the redistribution of land.</p><p>Despite his successes, Cleomenes faced opposition from other powerful families in Sparta who sought to limit his control. This led to a series of political struggles, and eventually, Cleomenes was implicated in a plot against the Spartan state. He was deposed, exiled, and ultimately died in Egypt by suicide in 489 BC. Despite his controversial reign, Cleomenes is remembered as one of the most influential figures in the history of Sparta.</p><p>In addition to his military campaigns and political reforms, Cleomenes I is also known for his personal and religious beliefs. He was a devout follower of the Delphic Oracle and believed that he had a special relationship with the god Apollo. Cleomenes also supported the cult of the Dioscuri, or the twin gods Castor and Pollux, and is said to have personally taken part in their religious rituals.</p><p>Furthermore, Cleomenes was known for his ascetic lifestyle and rejection of luxury and excess. He lived a simple life and practiced strict self-discipline, even going as far as to limit his own diet to only black broth, which was a Spartan dish made of boiled pigs' legs and blood.</p><p>Despite his relatively short reign, Cleomenes I had a significant impact on the history of Sparta and Hellenic civilization as a whole. His military victories and political reforms helped to establish Sparta as a powerful and influential city-state in ancient Greece, and his steadfast devotion to his personal and religious beliefs made him a revered figure among the Spartans.</p><p>Cleomenes I was also known for his military genius and his strategic mind. He implemented innovative tactics, such as using cavalry and light infantry to support his heavy infantry, which were traditionally the backbone of Spartan armies. He also used psychological warfare to intimidate and demoralize his enemies. For example, he famously ordered his soldiers to grow their hair long and wear a wild and menacing appearance to strike fear into the hearts of their opponents.</p><p>In addition to his accomplishments on the battlefield and in politics, Cleomenes I was also known as a patron of the arts and culture. During his reign, he invited several prominent poets, writers, and artists to Sparta, including the renowned poet Stesichorus.</p><p>Overall, Cleomenes I was a complex and controversial figure, whose legacy continues to be debated among scholars and historians. Some view him as a visionary leader who sought to modernize Sparta and create a more egalitarian society. Others see him as a power-hungry autocrat who used his position to pursue his own interests and ambitions. Regardless of one's interpretation, there is no denying the lasting impact that Cleomenes I had on Spartan society and the wider world of ancient Greece.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Claudius Galenus, Aelius Galenus, Galen of Pergamon or Claude Galien

	
was
a Greek
physician, philosopher and surgeon.


					</p><p>He was born in Pergamon, a city in Ancient Greece (now modern-day Turkey) and studied medicine in Alexandria, the most renowned center of medical learning at the time. Galen became the personal physician of several Roman emperors including Marcus Aurelius and made significant contributions to medical knowledge through his research and writings. He is considered one of the most influential physicians in history and his works were extensively studied in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Galen's theories and practices went largely unchallenged until the Renaissance, when new discoveries in anatomy led to the rejection of some of his ideas. Despite this, his works still have a significant impact on modern medical practices.</p><p>Galen's contributions to medical knowledge included extensive studies on human anatomy and physiology, and he is credited with being the first physician to perform experiments on live animals in order to better understand the workings of the human body. He also wrote over 500 treatises on various aspects of medicine, including pharmacology, physiology, and pathology. His work on the four humors, or bodily fluids, greatly influenced medical theory for centuries.</p><p>Galen was not only a physician, but also a philosopher who wrote extensively on the nature of the universe and human beings. His belief in the harmony of mind and body had a lasting impact on both medical and philosophical thought, and his teachings on the importance of diet and exercise for maintaining health are still followed today.</p><p>In addition to his medical and philosophical contributions, Galen was also a skilled surgeon and is known for his innovations in surgical techniques. He performed numerous surgeries, including cataract removal and amputations, and developed instruments that are still used in modern surgery.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Galen's influence waned in the centuries that followed his death. However, his works were rediscovered during the Renaissance and studied by prominent physicians such as Andreas Vesalius and William Harvey. Today, Galen is remembered as a pioneering physician and philosopher whose ideas continue to shape our understanding of the human body and mind.</p><p>Galen's ideas and theories were not limited to medicine and philosophy; he also made significant contributions to the field of logic. He argued for strict adherence to the rules of logic and believed that it was necessary to rigorously question and scrutinize claims in order to arrive at truth. Galen's logical works were particularly influential in the Islamic world, where they were studied and taught for centuries.</p><p>During his lifetime, Galen was also known for his public lectures and debates, which drew large crowds and gained him widespread fame. He was a respected authority on a wide range of topics and was often called upon to offer opinions on everything from politics to theology.</p><p>Galen's legacy continues to be felt in modern medicine, where his ideas about anatomy, physiology, and pathology still inform medical practice. His emphasis on observation, experimentation, and rational inquiry remains a cornerstone of scientific investigation, and his belief in the importance of maintaining good health through diet, exercise, and lifestyle choices is widely accepted today. Galen's contributions to the history of medicine and philosophy have earned him a place among the most influential figures of his time, and his lasting influence can still be felt in fields as diverse as medicine, philosophy, logic, and ethics.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Hippocrates of Cos or Hippokrates of Kos

	
was
a Greek
physician.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Thessalus and Draco.

						</p><p>Hippocrates is considered to be one of the most important figures in the history of medicine. He is often referred to as the "Father of Medicine" and many of his teachings and ideas are still practiced in the field of medicine today. Hippocrates is known for his contributions to the development of medical ethics and his focus on treating the whole person rather than just individual symptoms. He also emphasized the importance of observation and diagnosis in the treatment of illness. Hippocrates is credited with writing over 60 medical texts, many of which have survived to this day. His most famous work, the Hippocratic Corpus, is a collection of medical writings that includes the famous Hippocratic Oath.</p><p>Hippocrates was born on the island of Kos in ancient Greece. He was born into a family of physicians and it is believed that his father, Heraclides, and his grandfather, Hippocrates, were both doctors. Hippocrates himself received his medical training at the Asclepieion of Kos, which was a healing temple and medical school. </p><p>Hippocrates was not only a physician but also a teacher who trained other doctors. He founded the Hippocratic School of Medicine on the island of Kos, which became one of the most important medical schools in ancient Greece. </p><p>Hippocrates' medical theories and teachings were based on the idea that the human body has a natural ability to heal itself. He believed that illness was caused by an imbalance in the body, rather than by supernatural or divine forces. This belief led him to emphasize the importance of a healthy diet, exercise, and lifestyle in maintaining good health. </p><p>The Hippocratic Oath, which is still used today as a code of ethics for doctors, was named after Hippocrates. The oath prohibits doctors from intentionally harming patients, requires them to maintain patient confidentiality, and requires them to practice medicine with integrity and honesty. </p><p>Hippocrates is still remembered as one of the most influential figures in the history of medicine. His ideas and teachings have had a lasting impact on the field of medicine, and the principles he espoused are still followed by doctors around the world today.</p><p>Hippocrates' medical teachings were centered around the concept of humoral theory. This theory stated that the human body was made up of four humors; blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Hippocrates believed that maintaining a balance of these four humors was key to good health. He also wrote extensively about the importance of diet and exercise in maintaining a healthy body. Hippocrates was not only a physician but also a philosopher, and his writings touched on a variety of topics, including ethics, politics, and the nature of the soul. His ideas about the importance of observation and clinical diagnosis have been foundational in the development of modern medical practice. In addition to his medical contributions, Hippocrates was also an accomplished writer and is often considered to be one of the most important figures in the development of Western literature. His works have been translated into numerous languages and continue to be studied by scholars around the world. Hippocrates died in Larissa, Greece, at the age of 83. He is remembered as one of the greatest minds in the history of medicine and his contributions continue to inspire doctors and medical practitioners to this day.</p><p></p><p>

He made significant contributions to fields such as biology, physics, ethics, metaphysics, and politics. </p><p>Aristotle's work has had a profound impact on Western philosophy and science. His systematic approach to inquiry and his emphasis on empirical observation greatly influenced the development of the scientific method. Many of his ideas, such as his views on causation, have become fundamental concepts in modern science. </p><p>Aristotle was also a prolific writer, and his surviving works are among the most influential in Western thought. His works include "The Nicomachean Ethics," "Politics," "Metaphysics," and "Poetics." </p><p>Despite his vast contributions to philosophy and science, Aristotle's ideas were not universally accepted in his own time. It wasn't until centuries later that his work was rediscovered and his ideas began to be more widely appreciated. Today, he is considered one of the greatest thinkers in human history.</p><p>One of Aristotle's most notable accomplishments was his classification system. He believed that everything in the natural world could be sorted into categories, and he created a system for doing so that is still used today. He is also credited with laying the groundwork for modern zoology, and his biological works include detailed observations of animal behavior and anatomy.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and philosophical pursuits, Aristotle was also involved in politics. He served as the tutor to Alexander the Great, and later he became a consultant to the Macedonian court. However, his views on government were controversial, and he was eventually forced to flee Athens when the city became hostile towards him.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced during his lifetime, Aristotle's work continued to be studied and admired for centuries after his death. His ideas have influenced countless scholars and thinkers throughout history and he remains a towering figure in Western philosophy and science.</p><p>Aristotle's impact on education was profound, and his philosophical ideas played a role in the development of schools and colleges throughout history. His emphasis on logic and critical thinking influenced the study of mathematics and logic for centuries to come. In addition, his examination of ethics and morality had a significant impact on the development of Christian theology in the Middle Ages. </p><p>Aristotle's legacy also extends to literature and the arts. His work "Poetics" is considered one of the most important literary works of all time and has greatly influenced the study of drama, fiction, and poetry. </p><p>While much of Aristotle's work has survived to the present day, many of his writings were lost over time. Fortunately, his works were preserved and later translated during the Islamic Golden Age, allowing his ideas to be transmitted to Europe during the Renaissance. </p><p>Aristotle's impact on Western civilization cannot be overstated, and his ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars and philosophers today.</p><p></p><p>

His ideas were often seen as radical and controversial, and he was known to have come into conflict with other philosophers of his time. Despite his relatively short life, Heraclitus left a lasting legacy on Western philosophy, and his ideas continue to influence thinkers and philosophers to this day.</p><p>Heraclitus was born into an aristocratic family in the city of Ephesus, in what is now modern-day Turkey. He was known to have traveled widely throughout Greece and studied with some of the most prominent philosophers of his time. Although he lived in relative obscurity during his lifetime, his ideas were widely discussed and debated among his contemporaries, and he was regarded as a brilliant and original thinker. Heraclitus was also known for his critical attitude towards traditional Greek religion, which he saw as being based on superstition and irrationality. He believed that true knowledge and understanding could only be achieved through reason and critical inquiry.

(January 1, 1970		Salamis Island-April 5, 2015			Macedonia)

	
		otherwise known as Euripedes, Euripide or Euripidész

	
was
a Greek
playwright, writer and author.


					
			
		His children
		are
		called
		Mnisarhidis, Mnisilohos,  and Xenofon Euripidous.

						</p><p>Euripides is considered one of the three great tragedians of classical Athens, along with Aeschylus and Sophocles. He wrote around 90 plays, although only 18 have survived, with some of his best-known works including "Medea," "The Bacchae," and "Electra." Euripides' plays often explored complex themes, including the power of women, the role of the gods, and the tension between reason and emotion. In addition to his work in the theater, Euripides was also a songwriter and lyric poet, and his poetry was highly regarded in his own time. He died in Macedonia at the age of 75.</p><p>Although Euripides was born on Salamis Island, he spent much of his life in Athens, which was the cultural center of ancient Greece. Despite achieving critical acclaim for his work, Euripides' plays were often met with controversy and criticism from his contemporaries. Many of his works were criticized for their unorthodox portrayal of gods and for their questioning of traditional Greek values. Nevertheless, over time Euripides' legacy grew stronger as his works spoke to audiences across generations and cultures. Today, he is remembered as one of the greatest playwrights in history, and his plays continue to be performed and adapted for modern audiences.</p><p>Euripides' personal life was marked by tragedy and turmoil. He married twice and had three sons, but little is known about his family life. In 408 BC, Euripides was exiled from Athens for political reasons and spent the rest of his life in Macedonia, where he enjoyed the patronage of King Archelaus. Despite his exile, Euripides continued to write and produce plays, and his works remained popular in Athens. Euripides was known for his innovative approach to theater, and his plays often incorporated elements of satire and comedy alongside their tragic themes. In addition to his surviving works, Euripides is also credited with introducing several new elements to the Greek stage, including the use of the deus ex machina (a plot device in which a seemingly unsolvable problem is solved by the sudden appearance of a god or goddess). Euripides' influence can be seen in the works of many later playwrights and authors, including William Shakespeare and Tennessee Williams.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 2015		Samos-April 5, 2015)


was
a Greek
mathematician and astronomer.


					</p><p>He lived around 310-230 BCE and was the first person known to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system, in which the Earth and other planets revolve around the sun. This theory was revolutionary for its time, as most people believed that the Earth was the center of the universe. Aristarchus also made contributions to the understanding of geometry, including the measurement of the size and distance of the sun and moon. His work influenced later scientists such as Copernicus and Galileo, and his ideas were eventually proven correct by modern astronomy.</p><p>Aristarchus was born in Samos, an island in the Aegean Sea, and received his education in Alexandria, Egypt. He was a disciple of the mathematician Strato of Lampsacus and studied under the philosopher Ariston of Chios. Aristarchus was also a contemporary of the famous mathematician Euclid.</p><p>Apart from his heliocentric model, Aristarchus is also known for his estimate of the distance between the Earth and the sun, which he calculated to be about 20 times the distance from the Earth to the moon. He also calculated the size of the sun to be much larger than the Earth, which was a significant breakthrough in the understanding of the solar system.</p><p>Outside of mathematics and astronomy, Aristarchus wrote on various topics, including ethics and politics. However, most of his works have been lost or have survived only in fragments.</p><p>Today, Aristarchus is considered one of the greatest astronomers of ancient times, and his work has influenced the development of modern science. The lunar crater Aristarchus is named in his honor.</p><p>In addition, Aristarchus was also a proponent of the concept of a universe with infinite space and matter, also known as the "cosmic infinity." He believed that the universe had no center and was boundless. This idea was controversial at the time as it went against the popular notion of a finite and centered universe. Aristarchus was noted for his mathematical prowess and his emphasis on using observation and experimentation to test scientific theories. He also had a deep interest in the movements of the stars and planets, and he proposed a theory to explain the retrograde motion of Mars. Although Aristarchus' theories were not widely accepted during his lifetime, they laid the foundation for future investigations into astronomy and physics.</p><p></p><p>

For example, the phrase "sour grapes" comes from one of his fables, "The Fox and the Grapes," which tells the story of a fox who cannot reach a bunch of grapes and then decides that they must be sour anyway. In addition to his fables, Aesop was also known for his witty sayings and aphorisms, which have been collected in books such as "Aesop's Fables and Other Tales."</p><p>Despite his lasting impact on literature and culture, very little is known about Aesop's personal life. Legends about him abound, such as the story that he was executed by being thrown off a cliff for insulting the people of Delphi. While the truth behind these stories may never be fully known, Aesop's enduring legacy as a master storyteller continues to captivate audiences to this day.</p><p>It is believed that Aesop was born as a slave and served as a servant in various households before gaining his freedom. He was said to have been physically deformed, with some accounts stating that he had a hunchback or was a dwarf. Despite this, Aesop was known for his quick wit and intelligence. He was highly respected by those who knew him and some even held him in high regard as a philosopher.</p><p>Aesop's fables often featured animals as the main characters, which was a unique way to convey moral lessons to the audience. Some of his tales also featured gods and humans, but it was the animal characters that made his tales so appealing to readers of all ages. Aesop is said to have written over 600 fables, but only a fraction of them have survived to this day.</p><p>Aesop's influence on literature and storytelling can still be seen today. His fables have been adapted and retold in countless ways, and his storytelling techniques have been studied by scholars and writers for centuries. Many famous writers, including Jean de la Fontaine and Hans Christian Andersen, have been inspired by Aesop's work and have incorporated his fables into their own stories.</p><p>Despite the mystery surrounding his life, Aesop's legacy lives on through his enduring fables and timeless wisdom.</p><p></p><p>

personality.


					</p><p>Agathocles was a Greek tyrant who ruled over the city of Syracuse in Sicily during the 4th century BCE. He began his career as a poor potter, but rose to power through a series of ruthlessly executed military campaigns and political maneuvers. Despite his tyrannical rule, Agathocles was a shrewd and capable leader who significantly expanded the power and influence of Syracuse during his reign. He is also famous for his military innovations, such as the use of elephants in battle. Agathocles died in 289 BCE, leaving behind a controversial legacy that is still debated by historians to this day.</p><p>During his rule, Agathocles executed many of his political rivals and purged the city of potential threats. He also made ambitious military campaigns against other cities in Sicily, Italy, and North Africa. In one notable campaign, he sailed to North Africa and conquered the city of Carthage, but was driven out after being defeated in battle. Agathocles' military successes were largely due to his innovative tactics, such as his use of elephants in battle and his use of diverse army units. Despite his controversial legacy, Agathocles is celebrated by some for expanding the power of Syracuse and for his military innovations.</p><p>Agathocles was not only known for his military conquests and political cunning, but also for his cultural contributions to Syracuse. He expanded the city's public works, building impressive new structures and buildings, including a new marketplace and a theater. The theater was particularly significant, as it became a center for artistic and intellectual life in Syracuse, hosting plays, music performances, and philosophical debates.</p><p>Despite his many successes, Agathocles' rule was marked with cruelty and bloodshed. He was notorious for his brutal treatment of anyone who posed a threat to his power, including political rivals and dissenters. In addition, he was known to use poison as a tool for political assassinations.</p><p>Agathocles' legacy continues to be debated by historians today, with some arguing that he was a skilled and effective ruler who contributed to the growth of Syracuse, while others see him as a power-hungry despot who caused great harm to his city and its people. Regardless of the controversy surrounding him, Agathocles remains an important figure in Greek and Sicilian history.</p><p></p><p>

philosopher.

Diogenes believed in living a simple life and rejected material possessions and societal norms. He was also known for his biting wit and sharp tongue, often using it to criticize the hypocrisy and corruption he saw in society. He was a disciple of Antisthenes, another famous Cynic philosopher, and his philosophy emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency and personal independence. Despite his humble lifestyle, Diogenes had a significant impact on philosophy and is still studied today.</p><p>Diogenes is most famously known for his encounter with Alexander the Great, who came to visit him while he was lounging in his barrel. When Alexander asked Diogenes if there was anything he could do for him, Diogenes famously replied, "Yes, stand out of my sunlight." This interaction highlighted Diogenes' contempt for authority and his commitment to living a simple, self-sufficient life. Diogenes is also known for his philosophical contributions to the idea of cosmopolitanism, the belief that all human beings belong to a single community based on shared citizenship of the world, regardless of cultural or political differences. His teachings continue to influence modern philosophy and the way individuals approach their relationships with their communities and society as a whole.</p><p>Diogenes was born in Sinope, a Greek colony on the coast of the Black Sea, in 412 BC. He was banished from his hometown for defacing coins, and thus began his wandering lifestyle. He initially traveled to Athens, where he became a follower of Antisthenes and embraced the Cynic philosophy. He then traveled throughout Greece, spreading his teachings and living in poverty. </p><p>Diogenes is also known for his famous "lamp" anecdote. He would wander the streets of Athens with a lamp in the middle of the day, claiming to be searching for an honest man. This story highlights his disdain for the corruption and dishonesty he saw in society.</p><p>Another famous quote of Diogenes is, "I am not an Athenian or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."

(April 6, 2015		Abdera-January 1, 1970)


was
a Greek
mathematician and philosopher.


					</p><p>Known as the "laughing philosopher", Democritus is best remembered for his atomic theory of the universe. He proposed that all matter is composed of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms, which are constantly in motion. This theory was groundbreaking for its time and influenced many later scientists, including John Dalton and Albert Einstein. Democritus also made significant contributions to the philosophy of ethics and the nature of reality, and his ideas were passed down through the works of later philosophers such as Epicurus and Lucretius. Despite being a highly influential figure, much of Democritus's work has been lost to history.</p><p>Democritus was born in the city of Abdera, which is located in modern-day Greece. He was born into a wealthy family and had the means to travel widely throughout his life. He is said to have traveled to Egypt, Persia, and India, which exposed him to a diverse range of cultures and ideas. Democritus was also known for his wit and sense of humor, a trait that earned him the nickname "the laughing philosopher".</p><p>In addition to his work on atomic theory, Democritus made significant contributions to mathematics, including the discovery of several irrational numbers. He also wrote extensively on ethics and moral philosophy, arguing that happiness was the ultimate goal of human life and that it could be achieved through the pursuit of virtue.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Democritus was not well-known during his lifetime and it was only after his death that his ideas gained widespread recognition. His work on atomic theory was particularly influential and remained a cornerstone of scientific thought until the development of modern quantum mechanics in the 20th century.</p><p>Democritus also had an interest in astronomy and believed that the universe was infinite and that the Earth was just one of many planets in the cosmos. He suggested that the Milky Way was made up of countless distant stars, a theory that was centuries ahead of its time.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, very little is known about Democritus. He was a recluse who devoted himself entirely to his studies, spending much of his time in solitude. He is believed to have lived to a very old age and some accounts suggest that he blinded himself in order to avoid any distractions from his work.</p><p>Despite the challenges of deciphering his surviving works, Democritus had a profound impact on the development of Western philosophy and science. His ideas challenged conventional wisdom and paved the way for many of the scientific breakthroughs that followed. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important thinkers of ancient Greece and a pioneer in his field.</p><p></p><p>

						</p><p>Ariston of Athens was reputed to be part of the nobility, making him come from a wealthy family. Aside from his children, very little is known about his life. However, his son Plato would become widely known as one of the most significant thinkers and philosophers of his time, and his influence in shaping Western philosophy is still highly regarded today. Some scholars believe that Ariston's influence on his son's work may have played a significant role in Plato's philosophical theories, although there is limited evidence to support this theory. Nonetheless, little is known of Ariston or his wife, making their history and contributions to philosophical thought more enigmatic than those of their more famous offspring.</p><p>Ariston's son Plato often referenced his father in his works, including the Republic and the Phaedo, in which Socrates, Plato's teacher, speaks highly of Ariston. In the Republic, Socrates tells Adeimantus, Ariston's son, that his father's "best qualities" reside in him. Despite the mention of Ariston in Plato's works, much of his life and influence on Plato's thinking remain a mystery. Some historians speculate that Ariston may have been involved in politics or had ties to the Pythagorean school of thought. However, without concrete evidence, these theories remain speculative. Despite his relatively unknown status, Ariston of Athens's contribution to philosophy through his son's work remains a significant one.</p><p>There are also some stories about Ariston's death that have been passed down through history. It is said that Ariston died when Plato was still young, leaving him and his siblings in the care of their mother. This event may have played a significant role in shaping Plato's philosophical views on family and society. This loss of a father figure may have inspired Plato to explore concepts like justice and the importance of education in his works. Other than this, very little is known about Ariston's life or the specific impact he had on Plato's work. Nonetheless, his legacy lives on through his famous son's contributions to philosophy and Western thought.</p><p></p><p>

The story of the 300 Spartans who fought to the death against insurmountable odds has inspired countless works of art and literature, and has come to symbolize the ultimate sacrifice for one's country or cause.</p><p>Despite the enduring legacy of Leonidas I, there is still much that is unknown or debated about his life and reign. Some historians have questioned the accuracy of the stories surrounding the Battle of Thermopylae, while others have suggested that Leonidas' reforms may have contributed to the decline of Spartan power in the centuries that followed. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that Leonidas I was a remarkable individual who left an indelible mark on Greek history and beyond.</p><p></p><p>

was
a Greek
philosopher and author.


					</p><p>He founded the philosophical system called Epicureanism, which taught that the highest good in life is tranquility and freedom from fear, and that the gods exist but do not actively intervene in human affairs. Epicurus believed that pleasure and pain are the ultimate determinants of human behavior, but he also taught that pleasure should be pursued in moderation and with consideration for long-term consequences. His philosophy emphasized the importance of friendship, simple living, and the pursuit of knowledge. Epicurus wrote extensively during his lifetime, but most of his works are lost. Only a few fragments and letters written to his students remain.</p><p>Epicurus was born on the island of Samos and began his philosophical studies at an early age. He traveled to Athens in 306 BCE at the age of 18 to serve his mandatory military service and to continue studying philosophy. In Athens, Epicurus founded his own school, the Garden, which served as a community for his students and followers. </p><p>Epicurus' teachings emphasized the importance of reason and critical thinking in everyday life. He believed that a happy and fulfilling life could be achieved through the pursuit of pleasure, but that pleasure should be sought in moderation to avoid excess and pain. Epicurus also believed that death should not be feared, as it is simply the end of consciousness and therefore should not cause us any concern.</p><p>Despite his controversial views, Epicurus' ideas had a significant impact on both ancient and modern philosophy. His teachings influenced many prominent philosophers, including Lucretius, Montaigne, and Thomas Jefferson.</p><p>Epicurus' ideas also had an impact on science, particularly in the field of physics, as he believed that the universe was composed of atoms that were in constant motion. He also believed that the universe was infinite, which was a revolutionary idea at the time. Epicurus was known for his advocacy of a simple lifestyle and his rejection of materialism. He believed that true happiness could only be achieved by living a life free of fear, pain, and unnecessary desires.</p><p>Epicurus was also known for his emphasis on friendship and community. He believed that a happy life depended on having strong relationships with others and that his school, the Garden, provided a supportive and nurturing environment for his students. Epicurus died in Athens at the age of 72, but his legacy lived on through his writings and the influence he had on subsequent generations of philosophers.</p><p></p><p>

a Greek
historian.


					</p><p>He was widely considered to be the "Father of History" and was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects with a methodical, investigative approach. Herodotus traveled extensively throughout the ancient world, gathering information and conducting interviews with a wide range of people, including travelers, scholars, and various local inhabitants. This allowed him to compile a vast amount of knowledge, which he later used to write his most famous work, "The Histories". Despite some inaccuracies and embellishments, Herodotus' work is still greatly respected for its direct and engaging style, as well as its detailed descriptions of ancient cultures and events.</p><p>"The Histories," Herodotus' most famous account, remains a classic work of history that still influences the way modern-day scholars view the ancient world. It covers the events of the Greco-Persian Wars from a largely Greek perspective, and includes tales of battles, intrigue, and heroic deeds, as well as discussions of larger political and philosophical questions. Herodotus was also known for his interest in ethnography and cultural history, and his work includes sections on the customs and beliefs of various peoples, including the Egyptians, Persians, and Scythians. In addition to his contributions to the field of history, Herodotus was also an important literary figure in ancient Greece, and his work has been studied and admired for centuries.</p><p>Furthermore, it is believed that Herodotus was not only interested in the past but also concerned with how it could inform and improve the present and future. He wrote in a way that encouraged his readers to reflect on the lessons that could be learned from the events he chronicled. Herodotus also explored the role of religion in society, including legends and myths, and he interpreted events through the actions and interventions of gods and goddesses. </p><p>In addition to being a historian and author, Herodotus was also known to have played a significant role in politics. He was involved in the politics of his birthplace, Halicarnassus, and reportedly played a role in its rebirth after it was destroyed by the Persians. Later in life, he became involved in the politics of Thurii, where he settled after leaving Halicarnassus. </p><p>Although not everything about Herodotus' life is known for certain, what is certain is the lasting impact he has had on the study of history and the way we understand the ancient world. His approach to history, which emphasized the importance of research and investigation, set a standard for the field that has lasted for centuries.</p><p></p><p>

He is also recognized for introducing changes to the legal and economic systems of Athens. Solon's poetry was widely admired in his time, and he was known for his wise and thoughtful sayings. His influence on Greek society lasted long after his death, with many later leaders looking to his legacy for inspiration.</p><p>Solon was born into a wealthy family in Athens and became involved in politics at a young age. In 594 BCE, he was appointed as the sole leader, or "tyrannos," of Athens, in order to resolve some of the city's social, economic, and political problems. During his time in power, Solon passed a series of laws that abolished debt slavery, reformed the legal system, and made it easier for all citizens to participate in government. Solon was also responsible for the creation of the boule, a council of 400 citizens who advised the city's leaders, and the ekklesia, a popular assembly where citizens could debate, discuss, and vote on laws and policies. </p><p>Solon's poetry was highly regarded by his contemporaries, and he was known for his pithy sayings, such as "Nothing in excess" and "Give advice to a wise man and he will become wiser; give advice to a fool and he will become more foolish." Solon's emphasis on justice, fairness, and equality influenced later Greek thinkers, including Aristotle and Plato, and his legacy as a champion of Athenian democracy remains strong to this day.</p><p>Later in his life, Solon traveled to Egypt and possibly to Asia Minor, where he learned about the legal and political systems of other cultures. He used this knowledge to introduce some further reforms in Athens upon his return. Solon believed in the concept of moderation in all aspects of life, which he saw as the key to individual and social harmony. He advocated for a balanced distribution of power, wealth and rights among citizens to prevent the rise of inequality and tyranny. Solon's reforms contributed to the development of a more egalitarian Athenian society, where even the poorest citizens had a voice in government.

Pleistarchus fought alongside his half-brother Agesilaus II in this battle, which saw the Spartans suffer a decisive defeat at the hands of the Thebans.</p><p>Pleistarchus' death left Sparta without a clear successor to the throne, and his half-brother Agesilaus II eventually took over as king.

was
a Greek
poet.


					</p><p>Iophon was the son of the playwright Sophocles and was known to have lived a short life. It is said that he was also a poet like his father and had composed a tragedy at a young age but did not live long enough to see it performed on stage. Some sources suggest that he died at a young age due to illness, while others suggest that he died in a battle. Despite his short life, Iophon's contribution to Greek literature and tragedy is appreciated to this day.</p><p>One of the few surviving anecdotes about Iophon concerns his father Sophocles' play Oedipus at Colonus. According to the story, Iophon served as a choregos, responsible for coordinating the music and dance for the play's chorus, but Sophocles was unhappy with his son's work and took over the role himself. Despite this, Iophon went on to become a prominent figure in Athenian society, holding public office and participating in the religious festivals that were an important part of Greek culture. Some scholars believe that Iophon may have played a role in the transmission and preservation of his father's works, as well as those of other Greek authors. Regardless of the specifics of his life and career, Iophon remains an important figure in the history of Greek literature, and a symbol of the talented and ambitious young people whose lives were cut short by factors beyond their control.</p><p>Some sources suggest that Iophon's tragic end may have been the result of his father's own actions. Sophocles is said to have disowned Iophon in favor of his other son, Ariston, and this may have contributed to Iophon's early death. Despite this, Iophon's legacy continued to live on in the works of other Greek writers. The philosopher Aristotle, for example, cites Iophon as an example of the use of foreshadowing in tragedy in his work "Poetics." Today, Iophon is remembered as a talented and promising young poet whose life was cut short, but whose contributions to Greek literature continue to be recognized and appreciated.</p><p></p><p>

					</p><p>Zeno of Elea is best known for his paradoxes, which were thought experiments that challenged commonly held beliefs about motion and infinity.

This paradox led to a deeper understanding of the concept of limits, which would later become a fundamental part of calculus. Zeno's ideas would have a profound impact on the philosophical and scientific thought of his time and continue to influence thinkers today.</p><p>Zeno of Elea was born in the city of Elea (now Velia) in southern Italy. He was a student of Parmenides, who founded the Eleatic school of philosophy. Zeno was one of the main defenders of Parmenides' doctrine of the unity and immutability of being. He believed that the world was composed of a single, unchanging substance, and that the senses were not reliable sources of knowledge. </p><p>Zeno is also known for his contributions to the field of mathematics. He is credited with the invention of the method of proof by contradiction, which has become a staple of mathematical reasoning. This method involves assuming the opposite of a statement and then showing that it leads to a contradiction, thereby proving the original statement to be true. </p><p>Zeno's ideas were highly controversial in his time, and he was often mocked and criticized by other philosophers. However, his influence continued to grow, and his paradoxes became the subject of much debate and analysis in the centuries that followed. Today, Zeno is regarded as one of the most important thinkers of the ancient world, and his ideas continue to inspire new philosophical and mathematical insights.</p><p>Zeno's influence extended beyond philosophy and mathematics. He was also a political activist and played a significant role in the political life of Velia. Zeno was involved in a political uprising that aimed to overthrow the ruling oligarchy, which he believed was corrupt and unjust. He advocated for a more democratic system of government that would better serve the needs of the people. Zeno's political activism led to his exile from Velia, and he spent the rest of his life traveling, teaching, and spreading his ideas throughout Greece. Zeno's legacy has endured for centuries, and his paradoxes continue to fascinate and challenge thinkers today, inspiring new discoveries and insights in fields ranging from physics and mathematics to philosophy and literature.</p><p></p><p>

a Greek
mathematician and engineer.


					</p><p>He is credited with inventing various machines such as the hydraulis (an ancient pipe organ), the water clock (clepsydra), and the piston pump. He was also one of the first to study the properties of air and the principle of the vacuum. Ctesibius was a prolific inventor and his works greatly influenced the development of mechanics and engineering in the ancient world. He is often regarded as one of the most innovative thinkers of his time and his ideas still have relevance today.</p><p>Ctesibius was born in Alexandria, Egypt, which was a center for intellectual and scientific activity during the Hellenistic period. He studied under renowned mathematician and engineer, Euclid, and later became the head of the Museum of Alexandria, a center for research and learning.</p><p>Ctesibius' most famous invention was the hydraulis, a musical instrument that used water to create sound. He also developed the water clock, which was used for timekeeping, and the piston pump, which was used in a variety of industries.</p><p>In addition to his inventions, Ctesibius made other contributions to science and mathematics. He studied the properties of air and the principle of the vacuum, which laid the foundation for the development of pneumatic technologies. He also developed a system for measuring the distance between cities based on the Earth's circumference.</p><p>Ctesibius' inventions and ideas had a significant impact on the development of technology, particularly in the fields of mechanics and engineering. His work influenced later inventors such as Leonardo da Vinci and his ideas still inspire new inventions today. He is remembered as one of the greatest inventors and thinkers of the ancient world.</p><p>Ctesibius was not only an inventor, but also a skilled craftsman who designed and constructed many of his own machines. He was known for his attention to detail and his ability to create complex mechanisms with precision. His work with water clocks, in particular, demonstrated his mastery of intricate design and his understanding of the principles of fluid mechanics.</p><p>Ctesibius was also a popular teacher and his ideas and methods were widely disseminated throughout the ancient world. He was part of a tradition of Greek scientific inquiry that emphasized experimentation and observation, and his work helped to lay the foundation for the scientific method as we understand it today.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, relatively little is known about Ctesibius' life and personality.

(April 5, 2015		İznik-April 5, 2015			Bithynia)


was
a Greek
historian.


					</p><p>He was born to a wealthy family and served as a senator in Rome during the reigns of the emperors Commodus and Septimius Severus. Cassius Dio is best known for his Roman History, a sprawling work in 80 books that covers the period from the founding of Rome through the reign of Alexander Severus. He also wrote a number of other works, including an account of Rome’s civil wars and a biography of the emperor Trajan. His writings were highly respected in his time and remain important sources for the study of ancient Rome today.</p><p>Cassius Dio was also known for being a skilled orator and served as a consul in Rome in 220 AD. He was a close friend of the emperor Severus Alexander and accompanied him on a campaign against the Persians. Cassius Dio's writing style was known for being concise and clear, and he was admired for his ability to accurately convey historical events. His Roman History was one of the few works of its kind to survive the fall of the Roman Empire, and it has been studied and referenced by scholars for centuries. Despite his illustrious career, Cassius Dio's exact date of death remains a mystery.</p><p>In addition to his political and literary achievements, Cassius Dio was also interested in philosophy and was a member of the Stoic school. He wrote a treatise on the subject entitled "On Virtues and Vices." Cassius Dio was also known for his interest in numismatics, or the study of coins, and was one of the first historians to use coins as historical evidence. In his later years, Cassius Dio retired to his estate in Bithynia, where he devoted his time to writing and scholarly pursuits. His Roman History remains a valuable source of information on the Roman Empire and its rulers, and his influence can be seen in the works of later historians, including Edward Gibbon, who wrote "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."</p><p></p><p>
