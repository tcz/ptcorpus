							Mareuil began her career as a dancer and worked as a model before entering the film industry. She appeared in several French films, including "Entr'acte" and "L'Age d'Or," both directed by Luis Buñuel. However, she is perhaps best known for her iconic appearance in the surrealist short film "Un Chien Andalou," also directed by Buñuel, in which her eye is famously slit open with a razor blade. After a brief career in films, Mareuil left the industry to focus on her family and personal life. Tragically, she suffered from mental health issues in her later years and took her own life at the age of 51. Despite her short career, Mareuil's performances continue to captivate audiences and inspire filmmakers to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=5059596" title="Wikipedia article about Simone Mareuil">Simone Mareuil on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Renée Carl</h2><p><strong>Renée Carl</strong>
