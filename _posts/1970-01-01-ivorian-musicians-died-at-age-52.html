(January 27, 1959		Ivory Coast-April 1, 2011			Abidjan)


was
an Ivorian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a politician and a civil servant who served in several important positions in the government of Ivory Coast. Tagro was a close ally of former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo and a member of his inner circle. He was appointed as the Secretary-General of the Presidency and Minister of Commerce under Gbagbo's government. </p><p>Tagro's involvement in the political crisis in Ivory Coast during the 2010 presidential elections led to his arrest and eventual death. In April 2011, during the violent conflict between Gbagbo's forces and those of his opponent Alassane Ouattara, Tagro was among the most high-profile figures captured and detained by pro-Ouattara forces. He died in unclear circumstances while in detention. </p><p>His death sparked controversy and speculation that he was possibly killed by his captors. Investigations by the Ivorian government and United Nations have failed to establish the cause of his death. Tagro's legacy in Ivorian politics remains controversial, and his death continues to be a subject of debate and speculation among Ivorians.</p><p></p><p>
