(November 20, 1841		Saint-Lin-Laurentides-February 17, 1919			Ottawa)

	
		also known as Sir Wilfrid Laurier

	
was
a Canadian
politician and lawyer.


					</p><p>He was the seventh Prime Minister of Canada from July 11, 1896, to October 6, 1911, and is considered one of Canada's greatest statesmen. Laurier is known for his policies of conciliation and compromise between French and English Canadians, establishing Canada as a strong and united nation. He was the first francophone Prime Minister of Canada and the longest-serving Prime Minister in the British Empire, holding office for 15 years. Prior to his political career, he practiced law in Quebec and was elected to the Canadian House of Commons in 1874 as a member of the Liberal Party. Laurier also oversaw Canada's growing role in international affairs, including its participation in the Boer War and the negotiation of several treaties. His image appears on the Canadian five-dollar bill.</p><p>During his time as Prime Minister, Laurier implemented several notable policies, including the introduction of the first Canadian navy, the signing of a reciprocity agreement with the United States, and the expansion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. He also worked to improve worker conditions, including establishing the Department of Labour and passing the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act.</p><p>However, Laurier's time in office was not without controversy. He faced criticism from both French and English Canadians, particularly over his handling of the Manitoba Schools Question, which led to the suppression of French-language education in Manitoba. He also faced opposition from the Conservatives, who accused him of being too soft on issues such as tariffs and military spending.</p><p>Nevertheless, Laurier's legacy as a skilled politician and statesman has endured. He is often referred to as the "father of modern Canada" and his famous quote, "Canada is free and freedom is its nationality," has become a rallying cry for Canadians celebrating their country's independence and diversity.</p><p>Laurier was born in Saint-Lin, Canada East (now Quebec), the son of a farmer. He was educated at the Université Laval in Quebec City before studying law at McGill University in Montreal. After completing his studies, Laurier settled in the town of Arthabaska, where he practiced law and became involved in local politics.In 1874, he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons as a member of the Liberal Party. He quickly rose through the ranks and was appointed Minister of Inland Revenue in 1877. Laurier became Leader of the Opposition in 1887 and was elected Prime Minister in 1896, leading the Liberals to a decisive victory in that year's federal election.Laurier's commitment to compromise and conciliation was evident throughout his career. He famously introduced the concept of "sunny ways" in politics, advocating for a positive outlook and a willingness to work together to solve problems. He also championed the principle of responsible government, which aimed to ensure that elected officials were accountable to the people.Under Laurier's leadership, Canada experienced a period of significant growth and development. The country's population boomed, driven in part by an influx of immigrants, and the Canadian economy became increasingly diversified. Laurier also worked to strengthen Canada's ties to the British Empire while asserting its independence on the world stage.Laurier remained in office until his defeat in the 1911 federal election. He continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition until his death in 1919. Today, he is remembered as one of Canada's greatest leaders and a visionary champion of national unity and diversity.</p><p>Laurier's political legacy extends beyond his policies and leadership style. He was a staunch advocate for the expansion of civil liberties and human rights, particularly for women and minorities. He introduced legislation granting women the right to vote in federal elections in 1918 and was an early supporter of LGBTQ+ rights, openly opposing legislation that criminalized homosexuality.</p><p>Laurier was also an accomplished orator, known for his eloquence and charisma. He was a gifted speaker in both French and English and was known for his ability to engage with diverse audiences on a personal level. His speeches and public addresses were widely attended and reported on, and many of his quotes and phrases are still remembered and celebrated today.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Laurier was also a sports enthusiast and avid outdoorsman. He was a skilled boxer and wrestler, and enjoyed hunting, fishing, and canoeing in his free time. He was also a talented musician and played several instruments, including the violin and the piano.</p><p>Laurier's legacy lives on in Canadian politics and culture. His image and statue can be found across the country, and his name has been given to schools, streets, and even a university. His commitment to compromise, unity, and diversity continue to inspire Canadians today.</p><p></p><p>

a Canadian
physician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his role in the discovery of DNA as the genetic material. Avery worked at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City for over 40 years. In the 1930s, he and his colleagues discovered that DNA stores and transmits genetic information, contrary to popular belief at the time that proteins were the carriers of genetic information. Avery's work played a crucial role in the development of molecular biology and genetic engineering. He received many honors for his contributions to science, including the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 1945.</p><p>In addition to his groundbreaking work on DNA, Avery was also a pioneering microbiologist. He made significant contributions to the understanding of pneumococcal infections and their prevention through the use of vaccines. He also played a role in the development of the first commercially available antibiotic, penicillin, by providing crucial support and resources to fellow scientists working on the project. Avery was known for his meticulous attention to detail and rigorous experimental methods, which helped establish a new standard of scientific excellence in the field of microbiology. Outside of his work in the lab, Avery was an avid classical music enthusiast and an accomplished amateur violinist. He passed away at the age of 77 in Nashville, Tennessee, leaving behind a legacy of scientific discovery that continues to shape our understanding of the world today.</p><p>Throughout his career, Avery made significant contributions to various fields of research outside of microbiology and genetics. He conducted pioneering work in immunology, including studies on the immune properties of tumor cells and the development of immunity to pneumococcal infections. He also conducted research in the fields of gastroenterology, nephrology, and endocrinology, making important discoveries related to the role of hormones in regulating physiological processes.</p><p>One of Avery's most significant legacies is the Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment, which definitively demonstrated that DNA was the genetic material. The experiment is widely regarded as one of the most important experiments in the history of molecular biology and genetics.</p><p>Avery's work on penicillin was also vital to its development as one of the most important antibiotics in modern medicine. Avery understood the potential of penicillin early on and was instrumental in securing the necessary funding and support to scale up production of the drug.</p><p>Avery was a modest and private man who shunned the spotlight, preferring to let his work speak for itself. He was known for his tireless work ethic and dedication to scientific inquiry, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of scientists to push the boundaries of knowledge and discovery.</p><p>Despite his significant contributions to the field of science, Avery remained deeply committed to his personal life. He was married to a fellow microbiologist, Johanna Beijerinck, and they had two children together. Avery was a devoted father to his children and instilled in them a love of music, just as his own parents had done for him. He also enjoyed gardening, and spent much of his free time tending to his garden and backyard greenhouse. </p><p>Avery's work inspired many future scientists, including Nobel laureates James Watson and Francis Crick, who famously used Avery's work to help unravel the structure of DNA. The importance of Avery's discoveries continues to influence and shape modern scientific research, particularly in the field of genetics and genetic engineering. </p><p>In recognition of his scientific contributions, Avery was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1942 and was the recipient of numerous other awards throughout his life. Despite his many accolades, Avery remained a humble and dedicated scientist until his death in Nashville in 1955.</p><p></p><p>

Brownlee was an active participant in the development of the oil and gas industry in Alberta and is credited with helping to establish the Alberta Oil and Gas Conservation Board. However, his political career was brought to an end due to a scandal involving allegations of sexual misconduct with a young woman named Vivian MacMillan. The scandal caused significant controversy in the province, and Brownlee was forced to resign from his position as Premier.</p><p>After the scandal, Brownlee moved to Calgary where he resumed his law practice, and his reputation was tarnished for years due to the controversy. However, he regained some respect in later years after he was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1948. His contributions to legal education were also noteworthy, as he served on the Council of the Law Society of Alberta and was a vice-chairman of the Canadian Bar Association. Despite the scandal, Brownlee's legacy includes his significant contribution to the development of the oil and gas industry in the province of Alberta.</p><p>Additionally, John Edward Brownlee was an advocate for women's suffrage and played a key role in granting Alberta women the right to vote in provincial elections in 1916. He also served in World War I, enlisting in the Canadian Army and eventually attaining the rank of major. Brownlee's legal career was also notable, as he argued several cases before the Supreme Court of Canada and was appointed to the bench of the Alberta Supreme Court in 1950. Even with the scandal tarnishing his legacy, Brownlee remains an important figure in Alberta's history for his contributions to politics, law, and the oil and gas industry.</p><p>John Edward Brownlee was born on August 27, 1883 in Delhi, Norfolk County, Ontario. He was one of nine children of a farmer and Methodist minister. He completed his education at the University of Toronto, earning a degree in law in 1910. After graduation, Brownlee moved to Calgary, where he established a successful law practice. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled lawyer and became known for his expertise in the field of natural resources law.</p><p>In addition to his career as a lawyer, Brownlee was active in politics. He was first elected to the Alberta legislature in 1921 as a member of the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) party. In 1925, he was appointed Attorney General in the government of Premier Herbert Greenfield. When Greenfield resigned as premier in 1925, Brownlee won the leadership of the UFA and became premier himself.</p><p>As premier, Brownlee focused on promoting the growth of Alberta's oil and gas industry. He played a key role in establishing the Alberta Oil and Gas Conservation Board, which was tasked with regulating the production and distribution of oil and gas in the province. Under Brownlee's leadership, the government also invested heavily in infrastructure projects, including roads, bridges, and public buildings.</p><p>Brownlee's tenure as premier came to an abrupt end in 1934, when he was implicated in a scandal involving a young woman named Vivian MacMillan. MacMillan accused Brownlee of sexually assaulting her, and the scandal quickly became the most sensational in Alberta's history. Brownlee denied the allegations, but soon resigned as premier and withdrew from public life. In the years that followed, he worked to rebuild his reputation, but the scandal continued to haunt him until his death in 1961.</p><p>Despite the scandal, Brownlee's contributions to Alberta's development as a province were significant, and he left a lasting legacy as a pioneer in the field of natural resources law. His advocacy for women's rights and his service in World War I also cemented his place as a notable figure in Canadian history.</p><p></p><p>
