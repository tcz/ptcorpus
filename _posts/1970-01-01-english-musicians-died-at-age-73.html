She became known for her ability to create suspenseful and emotionally engaging plotlines. Wood's writing style was heavily influenced by the gothic genre, and she was recognized for her ability to create complex and often mysterious characters. Despite her success as a writer, Wood faced criticism from some quarters for her unconventional lifestyle, particularly her decision to live independently after her husband's death. Nonetheless, she remained popular among readers until her death in 1887 at the age of 73. Today, Wood is remembered as one of the most important female writers of the Victorian era, and her works continue to be read and enjoyed by readers around the world.</p><p>Wood's interest in philanthropy extended beyond her literary output, and she was involved in various charitable organizations during her lifetime, such as the Royal Literary Fund, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the British and Foreign Blind Association.

		Cyril Mountfort.

						</p><p>Benjamin Mountfort is known for his Gothic Revival style and for his contributions to the design and construction of numerous prominent buildings in New Zealand, including the Christchurch Cathedral, the Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings, and the Government Buildings in Wellington. He arrived in New Zealand in 1850 and settled in Canterbury, where he became known for designing churches, colleges, and other public buildings. In addition to his architectural work, Mountfort was also involved in politics and served as a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council from 1865 to 1870. He died in 1898 and is remembered as one of New Zealand's most influential architects.</p><p>Mountfort's training and architectural style was influenced by his time spent in London working under Sir Gilbert Scott, who was a leading architect in Gothic Revival design. Mountfort's work in New Zealand combined Gothic elements with contemporary design to create buildings that were unique and distinctive. Some of the notable buildings he designed include the Felons Court in Lyttelton, St. Saviour's Church in Christchurch, and the Clock Tower at the University of Canterbury, which is now a symbol of the university. He was also a pioneer in the use of new building materials such as reinforced concrete, which he used to construct the Trinity Congregational Church in Christchurch. Mountfort's legacy in New Zealand continues to be celebrated, with many of his buildings still standing and in use today.</p><p>Mountfort was born in Birmingham, England, and received his architectural training in London. After completing his apprenticeship under Sir Gilbert Scott, he worked for several years as an assistant and draftsman. At the age of 25, he decided to emigrate to New Zealand with his wife, Emily, in pursuit of better opportunities.</p><p>In New Zealand, Mountfort became one of the most renowned architects of the Gothic Revival period, and his work had a lasting impact on the country's architecture. He designed over 100 buildings during his time in New Zealand, ranging from churches and colleges to banks and office buildings. He was known for his attention to detail and his ability to create buildings that were both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>Mountfort's contributions to the design of the Christchurch Cathedral are among his most notable achievements. He originally designed the cathedral in 1864, but construction was delayed by various factors, including financial difficulties and the arrival of new settlers. The cathedral was eventually completed in 1904, several years after Mountfort's death, but the original design remained largely intact. Today, the Christchurch Cathedral is one of the most iconic buildings in New Zealand and is considered a masterpiece of Gothic Revival architecture.</p><p>In addition to his architectural work, Mountfort was also involved in politics and served as a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council from 1865 to 1870. He was a strong advocate for the preservation of historic buildings, and he played a key role in the establishment of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, which is now known as Heritage New Zealand.</p><p>Mountfort's son, Cyril Mountfort, followed in his father's footsteps and became an architect as well. He worked on several projects with his father before branching out on his own. Cyril went on to design a number of prominent buildings in New Zealand, including the Jubilee Clock Tower in Dunedin and the Grand Hotel in Auckland.</p><p>Today, Benjamin Mountfort is remembered as one of New Zealand's most influential architects, and his legacy continues to inspire architects and designers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
