She continued to act on stage and in European films in the 1950s and 1960s, but eventually retired from acting in the early 1970s. </p><p>Haas was also known for her singing, and recorded several albums of popular songs in both German and English.

She went on to star in several major films throughout the decade, including "Crime on the Night Express" (1937) and "Das Mädchen Johanna" (1935).</p><p>As Nazi Germany began to rise to power, Haas and her husband Franz Waxman, who was also Jewish, made the decision to leave the country and move to Hollywood. In Hollywood, Haas struggled to achieve the same level of success she had in Germany. She was often typecast in roles as a European immigrant or as the romantic interest of male leads. Despite this, she continued to work in film and on stage in the United States and Europe.</p><p>Haas' talents were not limited to acting; she was also a skilled singer. She recorded several albums of popular songs in both German and English, showcasing her versatility and range as a performer. Haas' legacy in the entertainment industry is one of perseverance and dedication to her craft, despite facing obstacles and adversity throughout her career.</p><p></p><p>

(September 5, 1928		London-June 29, 2006			Cambridge)


was
a British
pianist.


					</p><p>She began her piano studies at a young age and made her debut as a soloist at the age of 12 with the New Queens Hall Orchestra. Hatto went on to perform extensively throughout Europe and earned a reputation as a skilled interpreter of the Romantic repertoire. However, her career was cut short due to health issues.</p><p>In the 1970s, Hatto turned her attention to the recording studio and started releasing albums on her own label. Despite receiving critical acclaim, her recordings did not gain widespread recognition until after her death. In 2007, it was revealed that some of Hatto's recordings were actually the work of other pianists, leading to a controversy dubbed "Hattogate." Despite this scandal, Hatto's legacy as a pianist and recording artist remains significant.</p><p>Hatto was married to fellow musician William Barrington-Coupe, who also served as her recording producer. Following her death, Barrington-Coupe claimed that Hatto had completed a staggering 119 CDs in the final years of her life, an assertion that was met with skepticism by some members of the classical music community. In the aftermath of the controversy, it was discovered that Barrington-Coupe had in fact doctored some of Hatto's recordings by copying segments from other pianists and splicing them together. Despite the deception, many listeners still appreciate Hatto's authentic, unaltered recordings and her contributions to the world of classical music.</p><p></p><p>
