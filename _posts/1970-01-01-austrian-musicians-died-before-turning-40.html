He is remembered as a hero who sacrificed his life for the cause of freedom and democracy.</p><p>Ernst Künz was born in Vienna, Austria in 1912. He became involved in anti-Nazi activism at a young age, inspired by his father's socialist values. Künz joined the O5 resistance group, which was led by Austrian philosopher and political activist Otto Neurath. The group focused on spreading anti-Nazi propaganda, organizing underground meetings, and planning a resistance movement that would support an Allied invasion of Austria.</p><p>Künz was arrested by the Gestapo in 1944 and was subjected to severe torture during interrogation. Despite this, he refused to provide any information about the O5 group or its activities. He was eventually sentenced to death by hanging, along with his fellow resistance members.</p><p>The execution of Ernst Künz and the other members of the O5 group was a significant blow to the resistance movement in Austria, but it also served as a rallying cry for others who wanted to fight against Nazi rule. Künz and his fellow resistance members are remembered as heroes who gave their lives for the cause of freedom and democracy in Austria. Today, a memorial dedicated to Künz and the O5 group can be found in Vienna's Ottakring district.</p><p>Ernst Künz was married to Maria Künz, who was also involved in the resistance movement.

						</p><p>Elisabeth of Austria, also known as Elisabeth of Habsburg, was the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II and his wife, Maria of Spain. In 1570, she married King Charles IX of France in a diplomatic marriage arranged by her uncle, Emperor Maximilian II. </p><p>As queen consort of France, Elisabeth was known for her beauty and intelligence, but she struggled to adjust to the French court and customs. She was also deeply religious and had a strong influence on her husband's religious policies, which contributed to the outbreak of the French Wars of Religion.</p><p>After Charles IX's death in 1574, Elisabeth returned to Austria and lived there for the rest of her life. She continued to hold a prominent position in the Habsburg court and was a patron of the arts and sciences. Despite her short reign as Queen of France, Elisabeth left a lasting impression on the country's history and culture.</p><p>Throughout her time as Queen of France, Elisabeth faced numerous challenges and obstacles, including the constant pressures of court life and political tensions between Catholics and Huguenots. Despite these challenges, Elisabeth was known for her kindness and compassion, and she often used her position of power to help those in need.</p><p>Elisabeth was also a lover of the arts, and she played an important role in promoting the cultural development of both France and Austria.

However, her legacy as an influential and compassionate queen, as well as a patron of the arts and sciences, lives on to this day.</p><p>Elisabeth of Austria's position as a member of the Habsburg family made her a valuable pawn in the political games of her time. Her marriage to Charles IX was arranged in part to strengthen the political ties between Austria and France. However, the marriage was fraught with difficulties from the beginning, and Elisabeth struggled to find her place at the French court. She was never fully accepted by the French nobility, who resented her status as a foreign queen.</p><p>As a devout Catholic, Elisabeth was deeply troubled by the religious conflicts that were tearing France apart. She used her influence as queen to advocate for tolerance and peace, but her efforts were largely unsuccessful. The St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed, occurred during her reign, and she was unable to prevent it.</p><p>Despite the challenges she faced, Elisabeth is remembered as a woman of great intelligence, beauty, and charm. She enjoyed music and dance and was known for her elegant fashion sense. She was a skilled diplomat and negotiator, and she used her connections with her family and other European rulers to advance her interests.</p><p>Elisabeth's death at the age of 37 was a great loss to her family and her court. She was mourned by many, including her daughter, who went on to lead a relatively quiet life as a nun.
