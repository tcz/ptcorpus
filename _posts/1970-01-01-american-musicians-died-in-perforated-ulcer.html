						Parker is considered one of the most influential jazz musicians in history, and is credited with co-founding the musical style known as bebop. He began playing the saxophone at a young age and was largely self-taught. He first gained recognition in the 1940s as a member of the Jay McShann Orchestra before forming his own groups. Despite struggling with drug addiction throughout his career, Parker continued to produce innovative and powerful music until his death at the age of 34. In addition to his work as a musician, Parker was also a composer who wrote numerous jazz standards, including "Ornithology," "Scrapple from the Apple," and "Anthropology." He has been posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, the Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=54408" title="Wikipedia article about Charlie Parker">Charlie Parker on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actresses-died-in-cardiomyopathy.html' title='American actresses died in Cardiomyopathy'><strong>American actresses died in Cardiomyopathy</strong> List of the top 2 American actresses who died in Cardiomyopathy</a></li><li><a href='/colombian-musicians-died-at-age-61.html' title='Colombian musicians died at age 61'><strong>Colombian musicians died at age 61</strong> List of the top 2 Colombian music stars who died when they were 61</a></li><li><a href='/czech-musicians-died-at-age-80.html' title='Czech musicians died at age 80'><strong>Czech musicians died at age 80</strong> List of the top 15 Czech music stars who died when they were 80</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/bangladeshi-musicians-died-at-age-20.html' title='Bangladeshi musicians died at age 20'><strong>Bangladeshi musicians died at age 20</strong> List of the top 2 Bangladeshi music stars who died when they were 20</a></li><li><a href='/american-musicians-died-before-turning-20.html' title='American musicians died before turning 20'><strong>American musicians died before turning 20</strong> List of the top 15 American music stars who died before 20</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-ruptured.html' title='Famous musicians died in Thoracic aortic aneurysm, ruptured'><strong>Famous musicians died in Thoracic aortic aneurysm, ruptured</strong> List of the top 1 Famous music stars who died in Thoracic aortic aneurysm, ruptured</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
