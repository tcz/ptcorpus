(March 15, 1878		Alasht-July 26, 1944			Johannesburg)

	
		a.k.a. Rezā Shāh Pahlavi or Rezā Khan

	
was
an Iranian
politician and military officer.


					
			
		He had
		eleven
		children,
		Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Ashraf Pahlavi, Ali Reza Pahlavi, Shams Pahlavi, Hamdamsaltaneh Pahlavi, Abdul Reza Pahlavi, Ahmad Reza Pahlavi, Mahmud Reza Pahlavi, Fatimeh Pahlavi, Gholam Reza Pahlavi and Hamid Reza Pahlavi.

						</p><p>Rezā Shāh rose to power in 1921 after leading a successful coup against the Qajar dynasty. He went on to establish the Pahlavi dynasty and became the first shah of Iran in 1925. During his reign, he implemented various modernization policies and initiatives, including the adoption of Western attire, the promotion of education, and the construction of infrastructure. He also changed the name of Persia to Iran, which means "land of the Aryans." Rezā Shāh's rule was marked by authoritarianism and a crackdown on political opposition, which led to widespread unrest and a failed assassination attempt in 1936. Eventually, he was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in 1941, following an invasion by British and Soviet forces during World War II. Rezā Shāh spent his remaining years in exile in South Africa, where he died in 1944.</p><p>Additionally, Rezā Shāh is well-known for his efforts to modernize the Iranian military, establishing the Imperial Iranian Army and Air Force. He also implemented reforms aimed at promoting gender equality, such as the unveiling of women and the banning of polygamy. These reforms faced opposition from traditionalists and religious leaders, leading to tensions within Iranian society. Despite this, Rezā Shāh remained committed to his vision of modernizing Iran and bringing the country into the 20th century. His legacy has been a subject of debate in Iran, with some praising his achievements in modernization and others criticizing his authoritarianism and repression of political dissent.</p><p>In addition to his domestic policies, Rezā Shāh also pursued an active foreign policy, seeking to establish Iran as a regional power. He pursued closer ties with European powers and maintained a neutral stance during World War II before being forced to abdicate by the invading forces. His efforts to modernize the country and promote gender equality were part of a broader effort to position Iran as a beacon of progress and modernity in the Middle East. Despite his achievements in modernizing Iran, Rezā Shāh's authoritarian rule and crackdowns on political dissent continue to be a contentious issue among Iranians. His son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, went on to rule Iran until 1979 when he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution, marking the end of the Pahlavi dynasty.</p><p></p><p>
