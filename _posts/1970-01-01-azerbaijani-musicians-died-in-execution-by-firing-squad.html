		a.k.a. Khadija Osman bey qizi Gayibova or Khadija Muftizadeh

	
was
an Azerbaijani
pianist and teacher.


					</p><p>Khadija Gayibova was born into a family of musicians and developed her passion for music at a young age. She studied at the Tbilisi Conservatoire and later at the Moscow Conservatory, where she studied under some of the most renowned pianists of her time. After completing her studies, she returned to Azerbaijan and began teaching at the Baku Conservatory.</p><p>Aside from her teaching career, Gayibova was also a celebrated pianist and gave numerous concerts both in Azerbaijan and abroad. Her playing was characterized by a unique style that combined elements of Azerbaijani traditional music with Western classical music. In addition to her solo career, she also played in a duo with the violinist Zaki Mammadov.</p><p>Despite her success as a musician and teacher, Gayibova fell victim to the purges of the Stalinist regime and was arrested in 1937 on false charges of espionage. She was sentenced to death and executed in 1938. However, her legacy as a pioneering Azerbaijani pianist and teacher lives on, and she is still remembered as one of the most talented and influential musicians of her time.</p><p>Gayibova's contributions to Azerbaijani music also extend beyond her career as a pianist and a teacher. She was one of the founders of the Azerbaijan State Symphony Orchestra and served as its first deputy artistic director. She also played an important role in the development of Azerbaijani ballet, working closely with the composer Gara Garayev to create the country's first ballet, "Leyli and Majnun." </p><p>Gayibova's legacy was largely silenced during the Soviet era, but she was posthumously rehabilitated in 1955, with the authorities acknowledging the wrongful nature of her arrest and execution. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Gayibova's life and work, with concerts and performances dedicated to her memory. In 2018, the Azerbaijan State Symphony Orchestra performed a concert in honor of Gayibova, featuring her own compositions alongside works by her contemporaries.</p><p></p><p>
