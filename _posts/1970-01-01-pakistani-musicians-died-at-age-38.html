(February 10, 1964		Quetta-November 14, 2002			Greensville Correctional Center)

	
		also known as Mir Aimal Kansi or Aimal Kasi

	
was
a Pakistani
personality.


					</p><p>He was responsible for carrying out the 1993 ambush shooting outside the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) headquarters at Langley, Virginia, which resulted in the deaths of two CIA employees. Kansi fled to Pakistan after the attack and was later arrested by Pakistani authorities in 1997. Following a controversial extradition process, he was brought back to the United States to stand trial and was subsequently sentenced to death. Kansi was executed by lethal injection at Greensville Correctional Center in 2002. His case attracted international attention and sparked debate about the use of the death penalty and the extradition of criminal suspects.</p><p>Mir Aimal Kasi was born in Quetta, Pakistan in 1964. He grew up in poverty and worked odd jobs before becoming involved with militant groups. In 1993, he carried out the shooting outside the CIA headquarters, citing US foreign policy in the Middle East as his motive.</p><p>After the attack, Kansi fled to Pakistan and was able to live freely for several years. However, in 1997 he was finally arrested by Pakistani authorities and extradited to the United States to stand trial.</p><p>During his trial, Kansi became known for his erratic behavior and outbursts in court. Nevertheless, he was found guilty and sentenced to death.</p><p>Kansi's case sparked controversy due to the circumstances surrounding his extradition and the use of the death penalty. Some argued that his extradition violated international law, while others argued that he deserved the harshest punishment for his crimes.</p><p>Despite appeals and international pressure, Kansi was ultimately executed by lethal injection at Greensville Correctional Center in 2002. His case remains a controversial and divisive topic to this day.</p><p>After Kansi's execution, his family in Pakistan held a funeral for him where they claimed that he was innocent of the charges and had been handed over to the United States as part of a political deal. This claim, however, was not substantiated.</p><p>The Kansi case was also cited as a reason for increased security measures around government agencies and buildings, particularly in the Washington D.C. area. The shooting led to the installation of concrete barriers and other physical security measures around the CIA headquarters.</p><p>Kansi's attack on the CIA headquarters was not an isolated incident. In 1995, a car bomb outside a federal building in Oklahoma City killed 168 people and injured hundreds more. In both cases, the perpetrators cited opposition to U.S. foreign policy as their motive for the attacks. These incidents highlighted the growing threat of domestic and foreign terrorism in the United States in the 1990s.</p><p></p><p>
