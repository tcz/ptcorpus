(April 12, 1922		Antwerp-November 27, 1977)


was
a Belgian
photographer and painter.


					</p><p>Yoors was born to a family of artists and grew up in a community of Romani people in Belgium. His upbringing inspired his passion for Romani culture, which became a recurring theme in his artwork. During World War II, Yoors worked with the Belgian resistance and helped to rescue Jewish refugees from the Nazis. </p><p>After the war, Yoors moved to New York City and worked as a weaver and artist. He later became interested in photography and focused on capturing the daily lives of the Romani people. He also documented civil rights protests and the countercultural movements of the 1960s. </p><p>Yoors' photography and artwork have been exhibited in museums and galleries around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Brussels. He also wrote several books on Romani culture, including "The Gypsies" and "Crossroads Marseilles 1944." </p><p>Jan Yoors remained dedicated to the Romani people until his death in 1977. Today, his artistic legacy continues to shed light on a culture that has long been marginalized and misunderstood.</p><p>Yoors was a self-taught artist who learned the art of tapestry weaving from his parents. His tapestries became globally recognized and were eventually exhibited in major museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Art Institute of Chicago. Yoors' interest in photography developed after meeting famous photographers like Robert Capa and Chim Seymour in New York. He worked with them on numerous assignments and captured iconic photographs such as Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington in 1963. In addition, Yoors also worked as a filmmaker and produced documentaries that highlighted social issues prevalent in society at that time. Despite his success as an artist and a photographer, Yoors remained humble and committed to his cause of promoting the Romani culture. His dedication to preserving the Romani heritage compelled him to lead a life mostly isolated from conventional society. Jan Yoors' work continues to serve as a reminder of the importance of diversity and understanding in our society.</p><p></p><p>
