									</h1><p>Here are 1 famous musicians from Cyprus died at 65:</p><h2>Nikos Sampson</h2><p><strong>Nikos Sampson</strong>
(December 16, 1935		Famagusta-May 9, 2001			Nicosia)


was
a Cypriot
journalist and rebel.


					</p><p>He was a prominent figure in the EOKA movement during the 1950s, which fought for the liberation of Cyprus from British rule. In 1974, Sampson was a key player in the coup that overthrew Cypriot President Archbishop Makarios III, and declared himself president. This led to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which resulted in the division of the island into Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot territories.</p><p>After the failed coup, Sampson fled to Greece, where he was sentenced to death in absentia. He eventually returned to Cyprus and was granted a presidential pardon. He later became involved in politics and held positions such as the leader of the United Democrats party and member of parliament.</p><p>Sampson's involvement in the 1974 coup remains controversial, with some considering him a hero for trying to unify Cyprus and others blaming him for the ensuing Turkish invasion and division of the island.</p><p>He was born into a Greek Cypriot family and grew up in Limassol. Sampson attended the Pancyprian Gymnasium in Nicosia and started his career as a journalist, writing for various newspapers in Cyprus. He became the editor of the newspaper "Makhi" in 1958, which served as the mouthpiece for the EOKA movement.</p><p>Sampson's involvement in the 1974 coup was not his first attempt to overthrow Makarios. In 1967, he was arrested for plotting to assassinate the president but was released due to lack of evidence. Sampson went on to become the leader of the National Front, a political party that promoted enosis (the union of Cyprus with Greece) and was one of the parties that supported the coup in 1974.</p><p>Following his return to Cyprus and pardon, Sampson continued to be involved in politics, although he was largely ostracized by the Greek Cypriot community. He founded the United Democrats party and was elected to parliament in 1987. Sampson's health declined in the 1990s, and he died of lung cancer in 2001.</p><p>Sampson's legacy remains a controversial one in Cyprus, with opinions divided on whether he should be remembered as a hero, a traitor, or a misguided figure. Some supporters view him as a symbol of resistance against colonialism and oppression, while detractors blame him for the events that led to the division of Cyprus and the ongoing political turmoil on the island.</p><p>Sampson was married twice in his lifetime. His first marriage was to Sotiroula Christodoulou, with whom he had three children. After their divorce, he married Lena Sampson, with whom he had two children. Lena was a key figure in Sampson's life, and she stood by him through his tumultuous political career and in his later years when his health was failing. Lena also became involved in politics and was elected to parliament in 2016, advocating for the unity and reconciliation of Cyprus. Despite his controversial legacy, Sampson remains a significant figure in modern Cypriot history, and his story serves as a reminder of the complexities of political struggles and the importance of dialogue and compromise in resolving conflicts.</p><p></p><p>
