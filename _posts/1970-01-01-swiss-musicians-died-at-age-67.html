(April 24, 1849		Maschwanden-July 3, 1916)


was
a Swiss
physicist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work in the field of thermal radiation and blackbody radiation. Kleiner was a professor of physics at the University of Zurich from 1882 until his death in 1916. He was also a member of the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School, where he led the physics department. Along with his research in thermal radiation, he also worked on magnetism, electrical conductivity, and optics. One of his most significant contributions was the development of the Kleiner-Hanriot magnetometer, a device used to measure magnetic fields. Additionally, he was author to several books, including "Theoretical Mechanics" and "Thermodynamics of Gases." He was a member of the Leopoldina and the British Academy of Sciences.</p><p>Kleiner began his education at the Eidgenössische Polytechnische Schule (now ETH Zurich), where he earned a degree in mechanical engineering. He later pursued physics and earned his PhD from the University of Zurich. In 1879, he became a lecturer of physics at the University of Basel and later a professor at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School.</p><p>Kleiner's work on thermal radiation and blackbody radiation laid the foundation for modern quantum mechanics. He was also instrumental in the development of the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the Wien displacement law, both of which describe the emission of radiation by hot objects.</p><p>In addition to his scientific endeavors, Kleiner was a skilled mountain climber and explorer. He was one of the first people to climb the Lyskamm, a mountain on the border between Switzerland and Italy. He also conducted several expeditions to the Swiss Alps, studying the properties of snow and glaciers.</p><p>Kleiner died in 1916 at the age of 67, leaving behind a legacy of pioneering research in physics and an enduring impact on the field of quantum mechanics.</p><p></p><p>

		a.k.a. Dr. Hans Jenny

	
was
a Swiss
physician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering work in the field of Cymatics, which is the study of visible sound and vibration. Jenny spent a significant portion of his career studying the ways in which sound affects various substances, such as liquids, powders, and metals. His research led to the development of what is now known as the "Jenny Method," which utilizes various forms of vibration to create intricate, often mesmerizing patterns.</p><p>In addition to his work in Cymatics, Jenny also had a passion for music and was an accomplished pianist. He often incorporated his love of music into his research, using sound as a tool for creating patterns and exploring the relationships between different forms of vibration.</p><p>Jenny's work has had a lasting impact on the fields of sound therapy, acoustics, and music technology. His research continues to inspire artists, musicians, and scientists to this day.</p><p>Jenny's contributions to Cymatics and the study of sound earned him recognition and awards around the world, including the Gold Medal of the Italian Government in 1954, the Gutenberg Prize in 1964, and the Silver Medal of the city of Basel in 1971. He also authored several books, including "Cymatics: A Study of Wave Phenomena" and "The Structure and Dynamics of Waves and Vibrations." </p><p>Jenny was born in Basel, Switzerland in 1904, and received his medical degree from the University of Basel in 1929. He went on to become an assistant at the university's physiology institute, where he began his research on acoustics and the effects of sound on living organisms. He later worked as a practicing physician, but continued his research in cymatics throughout his life.</p><p>Jenny passed away in 1972 due to a heart attack, but his legacy in the field of cymatics lives on through the work of many scientists and artists inspired by his research.</p><p></p><p>

personality.


					</p><p>He was a philosopher, theologian, and professor of systematic theology at the University of Basel. Kutter was a prominent figure in the Neo-Orthodox movement and was influenced by the ideas of Karl Barth. He wrote extensively on theology, philosophy, and social and political issues. In addition to his academic work, Kutter was also a pastor and was known for his commitment to social justice issues, including workers' rights and the welfare of the poor. Despite his impressive body of work, Kutter's influence waned after his death, and he is now primarily remembered as a notable figure in Swiss theological and intellectual circles during the early 20th century.</p><p>Kutter's writings reflect his distinctive theological perspective, which emphasized both the transcendence and immanence of God. He argued that God's presence and action can be found in the world, but that this must be balanced with a recognition of the transcendent mystery of God. This perspective can be seen in his most famous work, "The Christian Doctrine of God," which was published in 1916.</p><p>Kutter's commitment to social justice was evident throughout his life. He was an early supporter of the Swiss Social Democratic Party, which advocated for workers' rights and other progressive causes. He also spoke out against Swiss neutrality during World War I, arguing that neutrality was not a legitimate moral stance in the face of injustice and aggression.</p><p>Despite his firm beliefs, Kutter was known for his openness to dialogue and exchange with those who held different views. He saw his work as a theologian and philosopher as a way to engage with the wider world and to contribute to the common good.</p><p>Today, Kutter's work is still studied by scholars of theology and philosophy, and his ideas continue to resonate with those interested in the relationship between faith and society.</p><p></p><p>
