(April 7, 1856		Burgdorf, Switzerland-December 14, 1884			Atlantic Ocean)

	
		a.k.a. Christian Ferdinand Schiess

	
was
a Swiss
soldier.


					</p><p>He is best known for his role as a member of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition, which was assembled to rescue Emin Pasha, the governor of Equatoria, who was besieged by Mahdist forces in what is now South Sudan.</p><p>Schiess joined the expedition in 1886 and was appointed as the captain of the steamer the "Nyanza". The journey was fraught with difficulties, including disease, hostile encounters with local tribes, and the challenging terrain of the African wilderness. Along the way, the expedition also faced intense resistance from the Mahdist forces, who were determined to prevent Emin Pasha from being rescued.</p><p>Despite the challenges they faced, the expedition ultimately succeeded in rescuing Emin Pasha and bringing him to safety. However, Schiess tragically died on the return journey, when the ship he was on, the Ville de Bruges, sank in a storm off the coast of France. He was just 28 years old at the time of his death.</p><p>Before his involvement in the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition, Ferdinand Schiess had also served in the Swiss military. He was a member of the Swiss General Staff and had been sent to study military tactics in Germany and France. Schiess's experience and knowledge proved valuable during the expedition, as he was able to help navigate through unfamiliar terrain and plan strategies for dealing with local tribes and the Mahdist forces. </p><p>Schiess's bravery and selflessness were widely recognized following his death. In his honor, a monument was erected in Burgdorf, Switzerland, which still stands today. Furthermore, a mountain in Uganda was named after him, Mount Schiess, and a street in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi is named after the ship he captained during the expedition, the Nyanza.</p><p>Schiess's contributions to the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition, and his dedication to serving his country, have made him a revered figure in Swiss history.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1498		Zürich-January 5, 1527			Zürich)


was
a Swiss
personality.


					</p><p>Felix Manz was a co-founder of the Swiss Brethren movement, which was an important precursor to the Anabaptist movement. He was also a theologian, writer, and publisher. Manz is known for advocating for adult baptism and the separation of church and state, which were radical ideas at the time. He was arrested and imprisoned numerous times for his beliefs, and ultimately he was sentenced to death by drowning. His execution was the first of many by Swiss authorities during the Reformation period. Despite his relatively short life, Manz left a lasting impact on the Christian church and religious freedom movements of the modern era.</p><p>Manz was born in Zürich in 1498, into a family of prominent city councilors. He received a humanist education and went on to study law at the University of Basel. However, his interests soon turned to theology and he became involved in the burgeoning Reformation movement. Along with Conrad Grebel and George Blaurock, he founded the Swiss Brethren, which was the first Anabaptist group in Switzerland.</p><p>Manz was a prolific writer and publisher and worked on several important theological texts. He also continued to advocate for the separation of church and state and the importance of individual adult baptism. His ideas were considered radical by both Catholic and Protestant authorities, and he was frequently arrested and imprisoned.</p><p>Despite his repeated imprisonments and torture, Manz refused to renounce his beliefs. He was eventually sentenced to death by drowning in the Limmat River, a punishment that was considered particularly cruel and unusual at the time. His execution is now viewed as a symbol of the struggle for religious freedom and the persecution and martyrdom of early Anabaptists.</p><p>Today, Manz is remembered as a key figure in the early Anabaptist movement and as a champion of religious freedom and individual rights. His writings and teachings continue to inspire Christian communities and religious freedom advocates around the world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in drowning.
