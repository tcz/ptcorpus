(April 5, 2015-April 5, 1999)


was
a Thai
politician.


					</p><p>He was born in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand and entered military service in 1951. Kongsompong played a significant role in the 1976 massacre of student protesters at Thammasat University. In 1991, he led a coup that ousted Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan and became the head of the National Peacekeeping Council. Kongsompong served as Prime Minister of Thailand for a short period before being overthrown in another coup in 1992. He retired from military service in 1993 and spent the remainder of his life as a businessman. Kongsompong died on his 84th birthday in 1999.</p><p>Kongsompong was known for his authoritarian style of leadership and for his close ties to the Thai monarchy. He was also involved in the drug trade, which led to allegations of corruption and abuses of power. Despite this, he remained a popular figure in Thailand, particularly among conservatives and royalists. Kongsompong was awarded numerous honors and awards throughout his career, including the Knight Grand Cordon of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant and the Knight Grand Cross (First Class) of the Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand. However, his legacy remains controversial, as many see him as a symbol of the military's interference in Thai politics and the suppression of democratic movements.</p><p>Following the 1976 Thammasat University massacre, Kongsompong was promoted to deputy army commander and became one of the country's most powerful military leaders. He played a significant role in shaping Thailand's political landscape during the 1980s and early 1990s. Kongsompong was also known for his anti-communist stance and his efforts to combat communist insurgency in Thailand. Under his leadership, Thailand became a strong ally of the United States and a key player in the fight against communism in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Kongsompong was widely respected as a military strategist and a patriot. He was known for his loyalty to the Thai monarchy and his commitment to maintaining stability and order in the country. Kongsompong's influence could be seen in the many military officers who went on to hold positions of power in Thailand's government and bureaucracies. Today, he is remembered as one of Thailand's most polarizing political figures and his legacy continues to spark debate and controversy.</p><p>During his military career, Kongsompong held various high-ranking positions, including Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He was also involved in the creation of the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC), a military organization responsible for maintaining internal security and combating insurgency in Thailand. Kongsompong was known for his hardline approach to dealing with dissent and his willingness to use force to maintain order.</p><p>As Prime Minister, Kongsompong implemented a number of economic reforms aimed at modernizing Thailand's economy and attracting foreign investment. He also made efforts to improve the country's infrastructure and social welfare programs. However, his authoritarian style of rule and alleged involvement in corruption and human rights abuses drew criticism from both domestic and international observers.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his legacy, Kongsompong remains a revered figure among many conservative Thais who view him as a guardian of traditional Thai values and a defender of the monarchy. His legacy continues to shape Thai politics and society to this day.</p><p>In addition to his military and political career, Sunthorn Kongsompong was also a successful businessman. He owned several companies, including a construction company, and was involved in real estate and other ventures. Kongsompong was known for using his position of power to gain economic benefits, leading to accusations of corruption and conflicts of interest.</p><p>Kongsompong's influence on Thai politics and society extended beyond his time in power. His military coup in 1991 set a precedent for future coups and demonstrated the military's continued influence in Thai politics. His legacy also played a role in the 2006 military coup that ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, as the military invoked Kongsompong's "National Peacekeeping Council" in justifying the coup.</p><p>Despite his controversial actions, Kongsompong was a skilled military strategist and a charismatic leader. His legacy continues to be debated in Thailand, with some seeing him as a hero and others as a villain. Nevertheless, his impact on Thailand's political and economic landscape cannot be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>
