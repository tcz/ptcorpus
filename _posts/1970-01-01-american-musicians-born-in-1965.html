He writes many of Primitive Radio Gods' songs, which often feature introspective lyrics and a mix of electronic and acoustic instrumentation. Outside of music, O'Connor is known for his interest in photography and graphic design. He has created album covers and promotional materials for a number of artists, including his own band.</p><p>O'Connor has also been involved in various side projects throughout his career. In the early 2000s, he formed a band called Wons Phreely, which released an album and toured extensively before disbanding. He also contributed music to the soundtrack of the film "Boys and Girls" in 2000.</p><p>Despite Primitive Radio Gods' success with "Rocket," the band experienced difficulty with their record label, which led to delays in releasing their second album. As a result, O'Connor released a solo album called "I Think My Older Brother Used to Listen to Lagwagon" in 2002. The album showcased a more stripped-down sound than his work with Primitive Radio Gods, featuring mostly acoustic guitar and vocals.</p><p>In recent years, O'Connor has continued to release music with Primitive Radio Gods. The band's most recent album, "Sweet Venus," was released in 2019. O'Connor has also stayed active in the Los Angeles music scene, often playing live shows at small venues around the city.
