					</p><p>He was a renowned tango singer, songwriter, and author. Calomino was particularly popular during the 1930s and 1940s and was considered one of the most important figures of the Golden Age of Tango. He began his career as a singer in small cafes and gradually moved up to larger venues in Buenos Aires, eventually becoming a fixture in the cultural scene of the city. </p><p>Calomino is best known for his interpretations of classic tangos such as "La Cumparsita", "El Choclo", and "Mi Buenos Aires Querido" which became staples of the Argentine tango repertoire. He also composed many tangos himself, including "Yo soy aquel muchacho", "Mi lamento", and "Canción de cuna". </p><p>In addition to his musical career, Calomino was also a prolific writer and published several books, including "Mi vida con el tango" (My Life with Tango) and "El tango y yo" (The Tango and I), which shared his experiences and thoughts on tango as a cultural phenomenon. </p><p>After his death in 1950, Calomino remained an important figure in the world of tango and his contributions to the genre continue to be celebrated in Argentina and internationally.</p><p>Calomino's interest in tango started from an early age, and he was often seen singing at social gatherings in his hometown. He was inspired by his grandfather, who was a tango guitarist and helped him develop his love for the genre. At the age of 20, Calomino moved to Buenos Aires to pursue his passion for tango singing. He started performing in small cafes and theaters, and soon his talent was noticed by some of the leading tango bands of the time. </p><p>Calomino's unique voice, which was rich and sonorous with a touch of melancholy, earned him a huge fan following across Argentina.

He was a member of the Socialist Party and wrote several articles advocating for workers' rights and social justice. He was also an admirer of the poet and political activist, Homero Manzi, and collaborated with him on several musical projects.</p><p>Calomino's popularity waned in the late 1940s, partly due to the rise of a new generation of tango singers and the changing tastes of the public. However, his contributions to the development of tango as a cultural phenomenon in Argentina cannot be overstated, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of tango musicians and aficionados.</p><p></p><p>
