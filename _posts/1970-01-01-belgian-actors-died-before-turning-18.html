							Dieudonné Kabongo was born in Katanga Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo on April 5, 1959, but grew up in Belgium.

In addition to acting, he also composed music for films including "Je suis mort mais j'ai des amis" and "Qui vive". </p><p>Despite his success, Kabongo was not without controversy. In 2003, he sued the magazine "Le Vif/L'Express" for defamation after they published an article linking him to alleged criminal activities.

He was survived by his wife and two children.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=33536001" title="Wikipedia article about Dieudonné Kabongo">Dieudonné Kabongo on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/bulgarian-actors-born-in-1946.html' title='Bulgarian actors born in 1946'><strong>Bulgarian actors born in 1946</strong> List of the top 6 Bulgarian actors who were born in 1946</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-actors-died-at-age-53.html' title='Canadian actors died at age 53'><strong>Canadian actors died at age 53</strong> List of the top 2 Canadian actors who died when they were 53</a></li><li><a href='/brazilian-actors-died-in-ballistic-trauma.html' title='Brazilian actors died in Ballistic trauma'><strong>Brazilian actors died in Ballistic trauma</strong> List of the top 1 Brazilian actors who died in Ballistic trauma</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/cuban-actors-died-in-1963.html' title='Cuban actors died in 1963'><strong>Cuban actors died in 1963</strong> List of the top 1 Cuban actors who died in 1963</a></li><li><a href='/belgian-actors-born-in-1978.html' title='Belgian actors born in 1978'><strong>Belgian actors born in 1978</strong> List of the top 6 Belgian actors who were born in 1978</a></li><li><a href='/congolese-musicians-died-at-age-54.html' title='Congolese musicians died at age 54'><strong>Congolese musicians died at age 54</strong> List of the top 1 Congolese music stars who died when they were 54</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
