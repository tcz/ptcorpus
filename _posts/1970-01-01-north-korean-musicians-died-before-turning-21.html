a North Korean
politician.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Jang Kum-song.

						</p><p>Jang Sung-taek was married to Kim Kyong-hui, the younger sister of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. He was considered a close confidant of current North Korean leader Kim Jong-un until his arrest in 2013. Jang held numerous high-level positions in the North Korean government, including Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission, which was the country's top military body at the time. His arrest and subsequent execution sent shockwaves throughout North Korea and around the world. Some experts believe that Jang's execution was the result of a power struggle within the North Korean government, while others point to alleged corruption and other crimes as the reason for his downfall.</p><p>Jang Sung-taek's political career started in the early 1970s, when he became a close friend and associate of Kim Jong-il. In 1992, he was appointed as the director of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) Organization and Guidance Department, a powerful position responsible for overseeing propaganda and ideological education. He held this position until 2004, and during his tenure, he played a significant role in consolidating Kim Jong-il's grip on power.</p><p>In 2010, Jang became a vital figure in the North Korean government when he was appointed as the Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission. He was also elected as a member of the political bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee, becoming one of the most powerful figures in the country's political hierarchy.</p><p>Jang was known for his unusually close relationship with his nephew, Kim Jong-un, who succeeded his father Kim Jong-il as North Korea's leader in 2011. Jang's role in the new regime was seen as crucial, as he was tasked with managing the country's economic reform program and played a significant role in building economic ties with China.</p><p>However, in December 2013, Jang was purged from the North Korean government, arrested, and accused of various charges, including corruption, womanizing, and drug use. He was also accused of trying to overthrow the government and replace Kim Jong-un as the country's leader. Jang was swiftly tried and executed by firing squad less than a week later, marking one of the most significant political purges in North Korean history.</p><p>Jang Sung-taek's execution was a significant event in North Korean politics, as he was one of the most senior officials to be purged in decades. His downfall was seen as a warning to others in the government who may have posed a threat to Kim Jong-un's leadership. Some experts also suggest that Jang's execution was an attempt by Kim Jong-un to consolidate his own power and eliminate potential rivals. Despite his controversial end, Jang's legacy as a high-level North Korean politician and his relationship with the leadership of the country has continued to attract interest and intrigue in the years since his death.</p><p>Jang Sung-taek was born on April 5, 1946, in Kangwon Province, which is located in what is now North Korea. He was the son of Jang Soo-keel, a North Korean exile who had fled to China in the 1930s before returning to his homeland after the Korean War. Jang Sung-taek's mother was a North Korean national who lived in what is now South Korea before the war.</p><p>After completing his education, Jang Sung-taek began working for the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), the ruling political party of North Korea. He quickly rose through the party ranks and became a trusted associate of Kim Jong-il, who would later become the country's leader.</p><p>Jang's rise to power continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, culminating in his appointment as director of the WPK's powerful Organization and Guidance Department in 1992. In this position, Jang was responsible for managing the country's propaganda and ideology.</p><p>After Kim Jong-il's death in 2011, Jang emerged as a key figure in the new regime led by Kim Jong-un, who was Kim Jong-il's son and successor. Jang was tasked with overseeing economic reforms and building ties with China, North Korea's largest trading partner.</p><p>However, Jang's close relationship with his nephew would not last. In December 2013, Jang was purged from the government and accused of various crimes, including corruption, womanizing, and drug use. He was swiftly tried and executed less than a week later, marking one of the most significant political purges in North Korean history.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his downfall, Jang Sung-taek is remembered as one of the most powerful and influential figures in North Korean politics in modern times. His relatively close relationship with members of the Kim family and his central role in economic reform efforts have continued to attract attention and speculation in the years since his death.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 2015		Vyatskoye, Khabarovsk Krai-April 5, 2015			Pyongyang)


was
a North Korean
personality.


					</p><p>Kim Man-il was a former personal secretary of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's aunt, Kim Kyong-hui. He was also believed to be the head of a trading company, linking North Korea with other countries. His death was surrounded by mystery and speculation as he was reportedly purged by the North Korean regime for charges of corruption or spilling state secrets. His body was found in the Taedong River in Pyongyang, which led to questions about whether he was pushed into the river or chose to end his life instead. Despite this, the North Korean government denied any foul play in his death.</p><p>Kim Man-il's death was not the first high-profile death in North Korea associated with its ruler's sweeping purges of officials. Before him, Kim Jong-un's own uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was executed on charges of treason in 2013. Like Jang, Kim Man-il's familiarity with the workings of the secretive and tightly controlled regime in North Korea made his final fate of much interest to foreign intelligence agencies. Prior to his untimely death, Kim Man-il had reportedly acted as a business liaison between North Korea and China, and was rumored to have been involved in smuggling activities as well. However, relatively little is known about his life, given the country's strict control over information, and much of what has been written about him is based on rumors and speculation.</p><p>Kim Man-il's mysterious death is just one example of the opaque nature of North Korean politics, which often leaves outsiders guessing about the inner workings of the state. Despite the lack of concrete information, it is clear that Kim Man-il played an important role in the country's trade and business networks, which are a key source of revenue for the regime. His death may have been intended as a warning to other officials, or simply a reflection of the regime's paranoia and distrust of anyone who might be viewed as a potential threat. Whatever the true story behind his demise, Kim Man-il's legacy serves as a reminder of the dark side of life in one of the world's most repressive and isolated countries.</p><p>Kim Man-il, despite his mysterious death and secretive background, was a significant figure in North Korea's business and trade networks. He served as a personal secretary to Kim Kyong-hui, the aunt of current leader Kim Jong-un, and was head of a trading company that connected North Korea with other countries. His involvement in smuggling activities and work as a business liaison between North Korea and China made him an important figure in the regime's revenue sources. However, his loyalty to the regime was called into question as he was reportedly purged for charges of corruption or leaking state secrets. His death, whether by his own hand or at the hands of the regime, remains a subject of debate and speculation. Regardless, his untimely demise serves as a reminder of the opaque nature of North Korean politics and the potential consequences for those who fall out of favor with the ruling regime.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of drowning.
