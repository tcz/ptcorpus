(April 6, 1898		Meaux-January 25, 1920			Paris)

	
		also known as Jeanne Hebuterne

	
was
a French
artist, art model and visual artist.


					
			
		She had
		one
		child,
		Jeanne Modigliani.

						</p><p>Jeanne Hébuterne was known for her relationship with Italian painter and sculptor Amedeo Modigliani, whom she met in 1917. She became his main muse, appearing in many of his portraits, and they had a tumultuous but passionate relationship. Despite their difficulties, they continued to be devoted to each other and planned to marry. Tragically, just two days after Modigliani's death from tuberculosis in 1920, Hébuterne threw herself out of a fifth-floor window while heavily pregnant with their second child. Her family blamed Modigliani for her death and took custody of their first child, Jeanne Modigliani, who later became an art historian and wrote a biography of her father.</p><p>Jeanne Hébuterne was born into a conservative family and was expected to pursue a traditional role as a wife and mother. However, she was determined to follow her passion for art and became a talented artist in her own right. She studied at the École des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and exhibited her work at the Salon d'Automne in 1918.</p><p>Hébuterne's artistic style was heavily influenced by Modigliani and his circle of avant-garde artists. She often depicted herself and her lover in her artwork, creating intimate and tender portraits that captured the intensity of their relationship.</p><p>Despite the challenges they faced, Hébuterne remained devoted to Modigliani until the end of his life. She was devastated by his death and chose to join him in death rather than face the world without him.</p><p>Today, Hébuterne's artwork is recognized for its unique blend of modernism and classicism, and her tragic story continues to captivate art lovers and historians around the world.</p><p>Hébuterne's artwork, which mainly consisted of sketches and watercolours, has gained increasing recognition over the years. In 2000, an exhibition of her work was held at the Musée de Montmartre, which showcased her talent and unique style. Her work often features delicate lines and soft colours, and her use of negative space creates a sense of intimacy and depth.</p><p>After her death, Hébuterne's family destroyed many of her works due to their graphic nature and intimate subject matter. Only a few pieces survived, but their significance has grown over time. In recent years, her work has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world, and her legacy as an artist continues to be celebrated.</p><p>Hébuterne's tragic story has also been the subject of several films and plays, including the 2004 film "Modigliani" and the play "Modigliani Unmasked." Her life and work have inspired countless artists, and her enduring love for Modigliani remains a poignant reminder of the power of passion and art.</p><p>After Hébuterne's death, her family took her first child, Jeanne Modigliani, and raised her as their own. Jeanne Modigliani later became an art historian and wrote a biography of her father, shedding light on his life and relationship with Hébuterne. In 1930, the Hébuterne family agreed to return Jeanne Modigliani to her biological grandparents, who raised her with the help of Amedeo Modigliani's brother. </p><p>Hébuterne's legacy also lives on through the numerous artworks that Modigliani created of her. One of the most famous is the painting "Jeanne Hébuterne with Hat and Necklace," which portrays her with a serene expression and subtle smile. This painting, along with many others, has become an iconic representation of the art and culture of the early 20th century.</p><p>Despite the tragic end to her life, Hébuterne's love for art and her devotion to Modigliani continue to inspire artists and art lovers around the world. Through her artwork and her passionate relationship with Modigliani, she left a lasting mark on the art world and her story remains a reminder of the beauty and brevity of life.</p><p>In addition to her sketches and watercolors, Jeanne Hébuterne also created a series of oil paintings. These paintings, which are less well-known than her drawings, reveal her skill in manipulating color and light. Some of her oil paintings, such as the portrait of herself and Modigliani entitled "The Eternal Couple," feature bold, rich colors and highly detailed brushwork. Others, such as her still lifes and landscapes, are more subdued, with soft, muted tones and simplified forms. Despite the differences in subject matter and style, all of Hébuterne's works display her keen eye for composition and her ability to capture emotion and mood through her art.</p><p>Although Hébuterne's life was cut tragically short, her impact on the art world has continued to grow over the decades. Her legacy as an artist and muse remains an inspiration to many, and her work continues to be celebrated and analyzed by art historians and enthusiasts alike.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1972-December 13, 1993			Montélimar)

	
		otherwise known as Vanessa Duries or Katia Lamara

	
was
a French
writer and novelist.


					</p><p>At the young age of 20, Vanessa Duriès published her debut novel "Le lien" (The Link) which was a controversial erotic novel. Shortly after, she became widely known for her semi-autobiographical novel "Une jeunesse" (A Youth) which chronicled her experiences as a submissive in sadomasochistic relationships. The book sold over 200,000 copies in a few months, making her an instant celebrity in France. </p><p>Duriès continued to write and publish multiple other books including "Histoire d'Ou," a sequel to Pauline Réage's erotic novel "Histoire d'O," and "Echo," a novel about a woman in a psychiatric institution. Despite her success, Duriès' life was cut short at the age of 21 due to a car accident. Her books continue to be popular in French literature and her life has been the subject of multiple biographies and even a film.</p><p>Vanessa Duriès was born in Montélimar, France, and grew up in a middle-class family. She was an intelligent and introspective young woman, and she developed an early interest in literature and writing. Duriès was also curious about the world of BDSM and began exploring it when she was a teenager. Her experiences in the BDSM community inspired much of her writing, which often focused on the themes of eroticism, power, and submission.</p><p>After the success of "Une jeunesse," Duriès became a controversial figure in France. Some criticized her for promoting a lifestyle that they considered dangerous and degrading, while others praised her for her openness and honesty. Duriès was often interviewed by the media and spoke about her experiences in BDSM, which helped to break down some of the taboos surrounding the subject.</p><p>Tragically, Duriès' life was cut short when she was involved in a car accident in December 1993. She was just 21 years old at the time of her death. Despite her short life, Duriès' writing has had a lasting impact on French literature and the BDSM community. Her works continue to be discussed and debated, and they have inspired many others to explore the world of BDSM in their own lives and writing.</p><p>Duriès was also known for her activism and advocacy work for the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. She identified as bisexual and often spoke out against discrimination and prejudice towards those in the community. In addition to her writing, Duriès was a skilled artist and created many illustrations for her books. She also collaborated with other artists on various projects. Duriès' legacy has continued beyond her death, with a number of posthumous works being published, including a collection of her drawings and an unfinished novel. Today, she is remembered as a talented writer who broke barriers and challenged societal norms with her frank discussion of sexuality and BDSM.</p><p>Duriès' work sparked a wider conversation about BDSM and consent in France, as well as across Europe. Some critics felt that her work glamorized and promoted abusive and unhealthy relationships, while others felt that she was simply depicting a valid and consensual lifestyle choice. Despite the controversy, Duriès continued to defend her work and her beliefs, often giving interviews and speaking at public events. </p><p>In addition to her literary and artistic achievements, Duriès was also a passionate activist for animal rights. She was known to be a longtime vegetarian, and she promoted ethical treatment of animals throughout her life. After her death, her family established the Vanessa Duriès Foundation, which provides grants to organizations that work to protect animals and promote animal welfare. </p><p>Overall, Vanessa Duriès was a complex and multi-talented individual whose life and work continue to influence and inspire people around the world. While her career was brief, her impact on literature, advocacy, and BDSM culture cannot be overstated. Today, she remains a beloved and respected figure in French culture, and her legacy will undoubtedly endure for generations to come.</p><p>It should be noted that Vanessa Duriès' writing style was often compared to that of the Marquis de Sade, an influential French novelist and philosopher known for his explicit depictions of sadomasochism and sexual violence. While Duriès was certainly influenced by de Sade's work, she also sought to challenge some of the misogynistic and abusive aspects of his writing.</p><p>In the years since her death, Duriès' work has continued to gain new readers and fans, particularly among younger generations who see her as a feminist and sex-positive icon. Her books have been translated into multiple languages and continue to be studied in universities and literary circles around the world.</p><p>In recent years, there has also been a growing movement to recognize Duriès' contributions to French literature and to rehabilitate her reputation. Some have argued that she was unfairly stigmatized and demonized by the media and literary establishment, and that her work deserves to be celebrated as an important part of France's literary canon.</p><p>Regardless of one's opinion of her work, there is no denying that Vanessa Duriès was a pioneering figure in the world of modern erotic literature, and a brave and outspoken advocate for sexual freedom and self-expression. Her legacy continues to resonate today, and she remains an important and influential voice in the ongoing conversation about sexuality, consent, and BDSM culture.</p><p></p><p>
