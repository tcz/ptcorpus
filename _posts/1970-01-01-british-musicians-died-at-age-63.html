(August 12, 1880		Bournemouth-October 7, 1943			London)


was
a British
writer and novelist.


					</p><p>She is best known for her novel "The Well of Loneliness" which was first published in 1928. The novel dealt with lesbianism in a frank and open manner, and as a result was highly controversial at the time. Despite the controversy, the novel was a best-seller and helped to bring discussions of homosexuality into the mainstream. Hall was a prolific author and wrote many other novels, poems, and plays throughout her career. She served as an ambulance driver during World War I, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for her bravery. Throughout her life, Hall struggled with her own sexuality and faced many challenges due to her open expression of her LGBT identity. Today, she is remembered as a trailblazer for the LGBT community and an important figure in British literature.</p><p>Hall was born Marguerite Radclyffe-Hall into a wealthy family in Bournemouth, England. She had a difficult relationship with her mother and as a result felt isolated growing up. She attended King's College London but left without getting a degree. After her service in World War I, she began writing full-time and published her first book, "The Unlit Lamp" in 1924. </p><p>"The Well of Loneliness" was Hall's most well-known work and was influential in the literary representation of same-sex love. However, it is worth noting that her portrayal of lesbianism in the novel has been criticized for its stereotypical depiction of homosexuality. </p><p>In addition to her writing, Hall was a member of the Women's Suffrage movement and was involved in women's organizations throughout her life. She was also a patron of the arts and was friends with many famous figures in the literary world, including Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf. </p><p>Hall's personal life was marked by numerous same-sex relationships, including with the artist Una Troubridge whom she met in 1915 and was with until Hall's death. Hall's struggles with her own identity, and the ostracism she faced as a result of her sexuality, led to a decline in her health in later years. She died of colon cancer at the age of 63. </p><p>Despite her problematic portrayal of homosexuality in "The Well of Loneliness", Hall's contributions to LGBT visibility cannot be denied. She opened doors for other queer writers to tell their stories, and her willingness to live authentically paved the way for later generations.</p><p></p><p>

was
a British
psychologist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on evolutionary biology and his contributions to the theory of kin selection. Hamilton proposed the concept of inclusive fitness, which explains how an organism's genes can benefit not only its own survival and reproduction, but also the survival and reproduction of its relatives.

Hamilton was also a pioneer in the use of mathematical models to understand biological processes, and his work has influenced many researchers in the field. Throughout his career, he published numerous influential papers and was recognized with many awards, including the Kyoto Prize in 1993.</p><p>Hamilton was born in Cairo, Egypt, but grew up in Kent, England. He attended University College London, where he earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics. Despite his love of mathematics, he became increasingly interested in biology and ecology, and he went on to pursue graduate studies in zoology. Here, he developed his groundbreaking theory of kin selection, which remains a central concept in evolutionary biology.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Hamilton was known for his unconventional lifestyle and political views. He was a supporter of eugenics and controversially argued in favor of aggressive population control. He also participated in left-wing political movements and was briefly a member of the Socialist Workers Party in the UK.</p><p>Hamilton died in 2000 from complications related to malaria, which he contracted while conducting research in the Congo.

He worked for a number of newspapers and magazines, including the Globe, the Pall Mall Gazette, and Pearson's Magazine. In addition to his writing, Le Queux was also a skilled linguist and traveled extensively throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa. His experiences abroad provided him with the background material that he would later use to bring a sense of realism to his spy novels.</p><p>Le Queux's first novel, "The Great War in England in 1897," was published in 1894 and immediately became a best-seller. Over the next few years, he wrote a series of similar novels, including "The Invasion of 1910" and "The Zeppelin Destroyer," which depicted German spies infiltrating British society and planning an invasion of the country. These books tapped into the fears and anxieties of the time, as tensions between Britain and Germany were on the rise.</p><p>Despite their popularity, Le Queux's books were met with increasing skepticism as the years went by. Many of his claims about German espionage were exaggerated or outright false, and his reputation suffered as a result. However, his legacy as a pioneer of spy fiction lived on, and his influence can be seen in the works of later authors such as Ian Fleming and John le Carré.</p><p></p><p>
