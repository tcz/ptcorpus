									</h1><p>Here are 12 famous musicians from Iraq died before 40:</p><h2>Qusay Hussein</h2><p><strong>Qusay Hussein</strong>
(May 17, 1966		Baghdad-July 22, 2003			Mosul)

	
		also known as Qusay Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti, قصي صدام حسين, Qusai or Qusay Saddam Hussein

	
was
an Iraqi
soldier.


					
			
		He had
		three
		children,
		Mustapha Hussein, Yahya Hussein and Yaqub Hussein.

						</p><p>Qusay Hussein was the second son of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and was considered to be his father's heir apparent. He held several high-ranking positions in the Iraqi government and military, and was responsible for suppressing the 1991 uprisings against his father's regime. He was also known for his involvement in the execution of political dissidents and the torture of prisoners.</p><p>After the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Qusay went into hiding with his father and older brother Uday. However, they were eventually located by American forces and engaged in a firefight in Mosul. Qusay and Uday died in the battle, along with their bodyguards. </p><p>Qusay's death marked a major milestone in the Iraq War, as it effectively ended the Hussein family's rule over Iraq.</p><p>Qusay's rise to power began in the late 1990s, when he was appointed head of the Iraqi Intelligence Service. This position gave him immense power over the country's security forces and intelligence agencies. His brutal tactics in suppressing dissent earned him a reputation as one of the most feared men in Iraq.</p><p>Despite his ruthless reputation, Qusay was also known for his charm and affability. He was a commanding presence in public, and was often seen as the public face of the Hussein regime. He was known for his love of luxury, and was rumored to own several villas and luxury cars.</p><p>Qusay's death was a significant blow to the Hussein family's hold on power. With both him and Uday dead, Saddam was left without any heir apparent, and his regime began to crumble. The subsequent fall of the Hussein regime led to a long and tumultuous period of instability in Iraq, with ongoing sectarian violence and political upheaval.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in firearm.

(June 18, 1964		Tikrit-July 22, 2003			Mosul)

	
		also known as Uday Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti

	
was
an Iraqi
personality.


					</p><p>Uday Hussein was the eldest son of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. He was known for his notorious and violent behavior, as well as his role as chairman of the Iraqi Olympic Committee. Uday was widely feared by the Iraqi people, who viewed him as being above the law due to his connections to the ruling regime. He was responsible for a number of horrific crimes, including the torture and murder of political dissidents, journalists, and athletes who failed to perform to his standards.</p><p>Despite his numerous crimes and abuses of power, Uday was often seen as being the heir apparent to his father's throne. However, his poor health and increasingly erratic behavior in the years leading up to the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 meant that he was unlikely to take over the presidency. Uday narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1996 that left him partially paralyzed, and his death in 2003 was widely celebrated by the Iraqi people.</p><p>Uday Hussein was also known for his extravagant lifestyle and love of luxury cars, yachts, and women. He was known to throw lavish parties and was often seen with a cigar in hand. Uday was also an avid sports enthusiast, particularly in soccer, and used his position as the chairman of the Iraqi Olympic Committee to promote sports in the country. However, his successes in sports were often overshadowed by his cruel treatment of athletes who did not meet his expectations. Uday's control over the media in Iraq meant that any negative stories about him or his family were suppressed or met with severe consequences. Despite his notoriety and violent behavior, some people in Iraq were still loyal to him due in part to his father's legacy and the power of their family. Despite this, his legacy remains that of a ruthless dictator's son who abused his power and ultimately met a violent end.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in firearm.
