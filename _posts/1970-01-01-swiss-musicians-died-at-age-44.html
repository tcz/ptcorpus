(May 10, 1900		Basel-January 8, 1945			Buchenwald concentration camp)


was
a Swiss
astrologer.


					</p><p>Krafft is best known for his predictions about World War II. He correctly predicted the outbreak of the war and the fall of France, which gained him popularity and respect from many. However, his predictions also led him to associate with the Nazi party and use astrology to support their cause. </p><p>Despite his involvement with the Nazis, Krafft's interest in astrology was not political. He believed in a scientific approach to astrology and conducted extensive research on the topic. He wrote several books on astrology, including "The Astrological Interpretation of Genesis," "Astrology and World Events," and "The Anatomy of Destiny."</p><p>Krafft's association with the Nazi party ultimately led to his downfall. He was arrested several times and eventually sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp, where he died only a few months before the end of World War II. Despite his controversial beliefs and actions, Karl Ernst Krafft remains a significant figure in the history of astrology.</p><p></p><p>
