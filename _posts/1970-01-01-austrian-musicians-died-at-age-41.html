(June 15, 1553		Vienna-February 12, 1595			Brussels)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a son of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II and his wife, Maria of Spain. Ernest was appointed governor of the Spanish Netherlands in 1592, and held the post until his death in 1595. During his term, he tried to maintain a balance between the Catholic majority and the Protestant minority in the region, but was ultimately unable to prevent the outbreak of the Eighty Years' War between the Netherlands and Spain. Ernest was also a patron of the arts, and is credited with the introduction of Italian opera to the region.</p><p>Ernest was the third son of Maximilian II and Maria of Spain. He received a comprehensive education and developed a love for the arts and politics. As a young man, he was appointed as the Archbishop of Cologne, a position he held for several years. </p><p>In 1582, Ernest married his cousin, Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain, daughter of Philip II of Spain. The couple had twelve children, including their eldest son, who would later become Philip III of Spain. </p><p>During his tenure as governor of the Spanish Netherlands, Ernest worked to improve the economic and cultural conditions of the region. He encouraged trade and commerce and helped to establish the University of Leuven. He also commissioned several works of art and architecture, including the construction of the Royal Palace of Brussels. </p><p>Ernest's efforts to reconcile the religious differences in the region were largely unsuccessful. He faced opposition from both the Catholic majority and the Protestant minority. His attempts to enforce religious tolerance were met with resistance and the outbreak of the Eighty Years' War led to increased tensions. </p><p>Despite his challenges as governor, Ernest was respected for his intelligence, diplomacy, and commitment to his duties. He died in Brussels in 1595 and was mourned by many in the region.</p><p></p><p>

(April 21, 1865		Graz-November 1, 1906			Wien)

	
		also known as Otto Franz Joseph Karl Ludwig Maria, Prince Imperial and Archduke of Austria, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia or Otto Franz Joseph Karl Ludwig Maria

	
was
an Austrian
personality.


					
			
		He had
		four
		children,
		Charles I of Austria, Archduke Maximilian Eugen of Austria, Alfred Joseph von Hortenau and Hildegard von Hortenau.

						</p><p>Despite being born into a prestigious royal family, Archduke Otto lived a relatively private life. He was known for his passion for botany and often spent his time tending to his plants and gardens. He was also an avid traveler and explorer, and embarked on multiple expeditions around the world. </p><p>Archduke Otto's death at the age of 41 was sudden and unexpected. He had been suffering from a mysterious illness for several years before passing away from pneumonia. His death was deeply mourned by his family and the people of Austria-Hungary, who revered him for his charitable work and dedication to public service. Today, Archduke Otto is remembered as an important figure in the history of the Habsburg dynasty and Austria as a whole.</p><p>As the eldest son of Archduke Carl Ludwig of Austria, Otto was originally in line to become the next Emperor of Austria-Hungary, but the assassination of his cousin, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in 1914 led to the downfall of the Habsburg monarchy. Despite never ascending to the throne, Archduke Otto remained actively involved in public life, serving as a member of the Austrian House of Lords and supporting various charitable organizations. He was also a strong proponent of universal suffrage and religious tolerance. Archduke Otto's son, Charles I, did briefly become the last Emperor of Austria before the country was dissolved after World War I. In 2004, Archduke Otto's grandson, Archduke Karl von Habsburg, was elected a member of the European Parliament.</p><p></p><p>
