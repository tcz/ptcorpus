					</p><p>This information is incorrect. Edward VIII was not Indian, he was a member of the British royal family. He was the eldest son of King George V and Queen Mary, and he ascended to the throne in January 1936 after the death of his father. However, his reign was incredibly short-lived as he abdicated the throne later that same year to marry Wallis Simpson, an American socialite who had already been married twice. Edward VIII was then given the title Duke of Windsor and he and Wallis Simpson lived in exile in France for the rest of their lives.</p><p>Edward VIII was known for his controversial decision to abdicate the throne, which caused a constitutional crisis in the United Kingdom at the time. His brother, George VI, took over the throne instead and Edward VIII became the first British monarch to voluntarily relinquish the crown.</p><p>During World War II, Edward VIII was appointed Governor of the Bahamas by his brother, where he served from 1940 to 1945. After his tenure as governor, Edward retired from public life and lived in France with Wallis Simpson, his wife.</p><p>Throughout his life, Edward VIII was a popular figure and had a keen interest in fashion, music, and the arts. He was also an accomplished sportsman and enjoyed hunting, polo, and golf.</p><p>Edward VIII was also known for his close friendship with Nazi Germany's leader, Adolf Hitler, which caused controversy and concern among the British public and government. His actions and statements regarding Hitler and the Nazi party led some to question his loyalty to the United Kingdom and his suitability to be king.</p><p>Despite his decision to abdicate, Edward VIII maintained a level of popularity and public interest throughout his life. He and Wallis Simpson were frequent subjects of media attention and their romance and marriage were widely covered in the press. </p><p>Edward VIII died in 1972 in Paris at the age of 77. He was buried in the Royal Burial Ground at Frogmore alongside his parents and siblings.</p><p></p><p>
