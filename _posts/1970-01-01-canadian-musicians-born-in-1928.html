						</p><p>composer, musicologist, and choir director of Swedish origin. He grew up in Upsala, Sweden, and began his career in music at a young age, studying under several renowned musicians. In 1949, he moved to Canada and spent most of his life there. He held several positions at prominent institutions, including the University of Toronto, where he started the first electronic music studio in Canada. He was known for his experimentation with various musical styles and techniques, including electronic and choral music. He produced a significant body of work, which includes operas, symphonies, choral works, and chamber music. He was also a music critic and author of several books on music, including a study of the works of Swedish composer Carl Nielsen. He received numerous awards and honors, including multiple Juno Awards, the Canada Council Molson Prize, and was made a member of the Order of Canada in 1980.</p><p>Bengt Hambraeus was an influential figure in Canadian music, having contributed significantly to the country's musical landscape. He was also involved in several artistic and cultural organizations, including the Canadian Music Centre and the Canadian League of Composers, where he served as president. As a musicologist, he was highly regarded for his research into Swedish music, and his work on the music of Carl Nielsen is still considered seminal. Hambraeus was also a dedicated teacher, and many of his students went on to become respected composers and scholars themselves. He continued to compose and perform music until his death in 2000, leaving behind a rich legacy that continues to inspire musicians and music-lovers alike.</p><p>Hambraeus had a deep passion for choral music and was particularly interested in exploring the possibilities of combining traditional choral works with electronic music. He founded the Festival Singers of Canada in 1954, which quickly became one of the country's leading choral groups. He led the choir until 1962 and during this time, they performed many of his own compositions, as well as works by other Canadian composers.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to the Canadian music scene, Hambraeus was also an active participant in the international music community. He served as a juror for numerous music competitions and collaborated with musicians and composers from all over the world. He received commissions from several major orchestras, including the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.</p><p>Throughout his career, Hambraeus remained committed to pushing the boundaries of music and exploring new ways of creating sound. He was innovative in his use of electronic music, synthesizers, and other technology, and his work has had a lasting impact on the field of music composition. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important Canadian composers of the 20th century.</p><p></p><p>
