						</p><p>Lorde was known for her activism in a number of intersecting social justice issues, including feminism, civil rights, and LGBT rights. She championed the concept of intersectionality before it had a name, and her writing explored the ways in which identities overlap and affect experiences of discrimination and oppression. Lorde's poetry is often cited for its rawness and sincerity, as well as its rich exploration of themes related to race, gender, sexuality, and class. In addition to her literary work, Lorde founded many grassroots organizations dedicated to activism and community building, and was a sought-after speaker and teacher. Today, she is remembered as an influential voice in American literature and activism, and her work continues to inspire new generations of readers and activists.</p><p>Born to Caribbean immigrant parents, Lorde grew up in Harlem and attended Hunter College and Columbia University. Initially working as a librarian, she began to gain recognition as a writer and poet in the 1960s and '70s, publishing works such as "Cables to Rage" and "From a Land Where Other People Live." Her seminal work, "The Cancer Journals," chronicled her experience with breast cancer, and has been credited with transforming the discourse around illness and disability in feminist and literary circles. In addition to her writing, Lorde served as a mentor to many young writers and activists, and was a founding member of the Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, a groundbreaking publishing company focused on amplifying the voices of women of color. Lorde's poetry, essays, and speeches continue to be studied and anthologized, and her legacy as a powerful, intersectional voice for justice and equality endures.</p><p>Throughout her life, Audre Lorde fought against various forms of oppression, including racism, sexism, heterosexism, and classism. She emphasized the importance of speaking truthfully and passionately about one's experiences, even if they were painful or difficult, as a means of connecting and empowering others who may have had similar experiences. In addition to her writing and activism, Lorde was also recognized for her teaching, and held numerous academic positions throughout her career. She was a visiting professor at several universities, including the University of California, Berkeley, and taught creative writing at City College of New York. Lorde was the recipient of many prestigious awards and honors, including the American Book Award and the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Media Award.
