					</p><p>He was born in a small village near Tabriz, Iran and was the second of eight children.

He was also a prominent activist, advocating for the rights of Iranian ethnic minorities and opposing the policies of the Iranian monarchy.

Despite his short life, Behrangi's legacy as a writer and social commentator continues to be celebrated in Iran and beyond.</p><p>Behrangi's literary works, including his novels and short stories, often depicted the struggles and hardships of rural life in Iran. His writing was heavily influenced by his experiences growing up in a rural village and his interactions with the working-class communities he taught in. Behrangi's stories were praised for their simple yet powerful language, and their ability to address complex social and political issues in a way that was accessible to a wide audience.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Behrangi was also an advocate for education and literacy in rural communities. He believed that education was key to improving the lives of the Iranian people and worked tirelessly to promote literacy among the rural poor. He also founded a literacy program to teach rural adults how to read and write.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced as a result of his political activism, Behrangi remained committed to his beliefs and continued to speak out against injustice until his untimely death. He is remembered as a courageous writer and activist who gave voice to the struggles of marginalized communities in Iran and inspired generations of Iranians to fight for social and political change.</p><p>Behrangi's contributions to Iranian literature and his social activism have had a lasting impact on Iranian culture. In his honor, the Iranian government established the Samad Behrangi Prize for Children's Literature, which is awarded annually to outstanding Iranian writers of children's literature. Behrangi's legacy also inspired other writers and activists in Iran, including the popular writer and political activist Ahmad Shamloo, who has been called the "poet of the Iranian people." </p><p>In addition to his literary and social work, Behrangi was also deeply influenced by his interest in environmental conservation. He was a vocal advocate for protecting the environment in Iran, and many of his stories and novels featured themes of environmentalism and preservation of natural resources. Behrangi's commitment to environmentalism was revolutionary at the time, as it was a relatively new concept in Iran, and he is hailed as one of the pioneers of the environmental movement in the country.</p><p>Overall, Samad Behrangi's life and work represent a unique combination of literary excellence, social activism, and environmental consciousness. His contributions to Iranian literature and society continue to be revered and celebrated, making him one of the most important cultural figures in Iran's history.</p><p></p><p>

						</p><p>Despite having a short life, Hemmat is remembered for his prominent role in the Iranian revolution. He was a member of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI) and played an active part in protests against the Pahlavi dynasty. In 1981, he was imprisoned by the Islamic Republic of Iran for his involvement in opposition activities. While in prison, he undertook a 40-day hunger strike, which led to the authorities transferring him to Majnoon Island in southern Iran. However, his health continued to deteriorate and he died in 1984 at the age of 28. Hemmat is regarded as a symbol of resistance in Iran, and his legacy has inspired many who continue to fight for democracy and human rights in the country.</p><p>Hemmat was born in the city of Shahreza, located in the central province of Isfahan. He grew up in a relatively poor family, and his father worked as a blacksmith. Despite facing financial difficulties, Hemmat was a bright student and had a passion for learning. He showed a particular interest in literature and history and would often spend hours reading books.</p><p>In the late 1970s, Hemmat became involved in opposition activities against the regime of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. He joined the PMOI, a leftist militant organization that sought to overthrow the government and establish a democratic state in Iran. Hemmat played an active role in organizing protests and demonstrations, and his charisma and leadership skills earned him the respect of his peers.</p><p>After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Hemmat continued to oppose the new Islamic regime, which he saw as a continuation of the despotic rule of the past. He was arrested in 1981 and charged with conspiring against the government. Despite facing torture and intimidation, Hemmat refused to confess to the charges against him and maintained his innocence.</p><p>Hemmat's hunger strike, which he began on February 12, 1982, was an act of protest against his unjust imprisonment and the regime's violations of human rights. He demanded a fair trial and better conditions for political prisoners. His hunger strike drew international attention and inspired many Iranians who were disillusioned with the Islamic Republic.</p><p>After his death, Hemmat became a symbol of resistance against oppression and tyranny in Iran. His legacy inspired many young Iranians to stand up for their rights and fight for a better future. In his memory, several schools and streets have been named after him, and his story has been the subject of books, films, and documentaries.</p><p>Hemmat's legacy also extended beyond Iran, and his story has inspired human rights activists and political dissidents around the world. In 1983, the United Nations issued a resolution condemning Hemmat's death and calling for an investigation into the treatment of political prisoners in Iran. His death also fueled international criticism of Iran's human rights record, which continues to be a subject of concern today.</p><p>In addition to his activism, Hemmat was also a dedicated teacher, and many of his former students remember him fondly for his passion for education and his kindness. He believed that education was a powerful tool for social change, and he encouraged his students to read widely and think critically. His commitment to education and his belief in the power of young people to change the world continue to inspire new generations of activists and thinkers.</p><p>Despite his short life, Hemmat's impact on Iran and the world at large is undeniably significant. He dedicated his life to fighting for justice and equality, and his story serves as a reminder of the power of individuals to effect change in the face of adversity.</p><p></p><p>
