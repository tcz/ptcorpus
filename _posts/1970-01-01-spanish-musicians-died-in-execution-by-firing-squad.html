						Federico García Lorca was one of the most prominent figures of the Spanish literary and artistic scene of the 20th century. He was born in the village of Fuente Vaqueros, near Granada, and grew up in a cultured environment that fostered his artistic inclinations. He studied law at university but soon abandoned it to pursue a career in literature and the arts. Lorca's poetry and plays address themes of love, death, nature, and the human condition, infused with surrealistic imagery and a strong sense of social and political commitment. Among his most famous works are the plays "Blood Wedding", "Yerma", and "The House of Bernarda Alba", and the poetry collections "Gypsy Ballads" and "Lament for Ignacio Sánchez Mejías". Lorca's life was tragically cut short in 1936, when he was executed by Francoist forces during the Spanish Civil War, for his political beliefs and his homosexuality.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=100031" title="Wikipedia article about Federico García Lorca">Federico García Lorca on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/greek-musicians-died-in-type-2-diabetes.html' title='Greek musicians died in Type 2 diabetes'><strong>Greek musicians died in Type 2 diabetes</strong> List of the top 1 Greek music stars who died in Type 2 diabetes</a></li><li><a href='/kenyan-musicians-died-at-age-46.html' title='Kenyan musicians died at age 46'><strong>Kenyan musicians died at age 46</strong> List of the top 3 Kenyan music stars who died when they were 46</a></li><li><a href='/polish-actors-died-at-age-59.html' title='Polish actors died at age 59'><strong>Polish actors died at age 59</strong> List of the top 2 Polish actors who died when they were 59</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/australian-actors-died-at-age-43.html' title='Australian actors died at age 43'><strong>Australian actors died at age 43</strong> List of the top 2 Australian actors who died when they were 43</a></li><li><a href='/french-musicians-died-in-electrocution.html' title='French musicians died in Electrocution'><strong>French musicians died in Electrocution</strong> List of the top 1 French music stars who died in Electrocution</a></li><li><a href='/south-korean-actors-died-in-diabetes-mellitus.html' title='South Korean actors died in Diabetes mellitus'><strong>South Korean actors died in Diabetes mellitus</strong> List of the top 1 South Korean actors who died in Diabetes mellitus</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
