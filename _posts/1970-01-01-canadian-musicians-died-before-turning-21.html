(April 5, 2015		Avignon-April 5, 2015			London)

	
		also known as Peter Radisson

	
was
a Canadian
personality.


					</p><p>Born in 1636, Pierre-Esprit Radisson was a French-Canadian fur trader and explorer who co-founded the Hudson's Bay Company. He was known as a skilled negotiator and played a vital role in the early fur trade between New France and the Indigenous peoples of the North American continent. Radisson is also known for his extensive travels and daring exploits, including his capture by the Iroquois and eventual adoption into their tribe. He later escaped and went on to explore the Great Lakes region and Northern Manitoba. In addition to his exploration and pioneering work in the fur trade, Radisson had a penchant for writing and keeping journals of his travels, which have provided valuable insights into the early history of North America.</p><p>Radisson's voyages took him as far west as what is now present-day Wisconsin and as far north as present-day Churchill, Manitoba. He was highly regarded by his contemporaries and recognized for his abilities as a fur trader and negotiator within Indigenous communities. After co-founding the Hudson's Bay Company, Radisson spent his later years in England and France. He died in London in 1710. Today, Radisson is remembered for his intrepid exploration, important role in founding the Hudson's Bay Company, and as a key figure in the early history of French-Canadian exploration and trade.</p><p>Radisson's early years were marked by a tumultuous upbringing. In 1651, he and his half-brother, Médard Chouart des Groseilliers, left their hometown of Trois-Rivières, Quebec, and ventured westward in search of furs. They eventually found themselves in the Hudson Bay region, where they established relationships with Indigenous peoples and furthered their understanding of the lucrative fur trade. </p><p>Radisson's forays into this business were not always smooth: he was repeatedly imprisoned and accused of trespassing and theft by the English, French, and Dutch authorities who sought to reap the benefits of the fur trade. Nevertheless, he persisted, and his experience and knowledge played a significant role in the early success of the Hudson's Bay Company. </p><p>In addition to his fur trading and exploration, Radisson's remarkable life was also shaped by his personal relationships. He married a Mohawk woman named Marguerite Couagne in 1665, and together they had at least three children. In 1682, Radisson returned to Quebec and married his second wife, Radegonde Lambert, with whom he had five more children. </p><p>Radisson's legacy has been the subject of some controversy, particularly in relation to his interactions with Indigenous peoples. While his journals provide valuable insight into the history of Indigenous-French-English relations in North America, they also depict Radisson as someone who exploited and betrayed Indigenous people for personal gain. Regardless of these criticisms, Radisson remains a complex and influential figure in early North American history.</p><p></p><p>

					</p><p>Sorry to inform, but it's highly unlikely that someone could die on the same day they were born. This seems to be a typo or error.

He spent his entire 13-year career with the Chicago Bears and retired as the all-time leading rusher in NFL history with 16,726 yards.

Payton was known for his incredible speed and agility, as well as his tenacity and determination on the field. Off the field, he was known for his philanthropic work and for being a role model to many young athletes. Payton died in 1999 at the age of 45 after battling a rare liver disease.</p><p>I'm sorry, but that is incorrect. Walter Payton actually died of a rare autoimmune disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis, which led to his liver cancer diagnosis. Payton's legacy, however, lives on.

Payton founded the Walter Payton Foundation, which supports various causes such as medical research, organ transplants, and providing opportunities for underprivileged children.
