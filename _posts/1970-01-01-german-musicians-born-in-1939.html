							A. R. Penck was a multidisciplinary artist whose work spanned from painting and drawing to sculpture, printmaking, and music. His real name was Ralf Winkler, but he used the pseudonym "A. R. Penck" to evade political persecution in East Germany where his art was considered controversial. In his early works, Penck used simplified figurative symbols to represent the human form, gradually evolving into more abstract and geometric forms in the 1980s. </p><p>Penck was also a musician, and he formed the experimental rock band NAM June Paik in the mid-1960s, releasing the album "Free Jazz" in 1969. He was fascinated by African and Oceanic tribal art, as well as prehistoric art and cave paintings, which influenced his artistic style.

He passed away in 2017 at the age of 77.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=4580506" title="Wikipedia article about A. R. Penck">A. R.
