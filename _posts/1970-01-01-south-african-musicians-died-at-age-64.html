		also known as Herman Max Gluckman

	
was
a South African
scientist.


					</p><p>He was a social anthropologist who made significant contributions to the field of anthropology. Gluckman studied at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he earned a degree in law before moving on to study anthropology at Oxford University in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Gluckman is known for his work on the study of African tribal systems, particularly the political organization of the Zulu people. He argued that political institutions in Africa were not simply relics of a bygone era, but rather dynamic and adaptive systems that evolved in response to changing circumstances.</p><p>In addition to his work in anthropology, Gluckman was also a passionate advocate for racial justice and against apartheid in South Africa. He was active in various anti-apartheid organizations and was arrested several times for his political activities. </p><p>Gluckman was a prolific writer and his seminal works include "The Judicial Process Among the Barotse of Northern Rhodesia" (1955) and "Politics, Law, and Ritual in Tribal Society" (1965). His contributions to the field of anthropology were recognized with numerous awards, and he was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1968.</p><p>Gluckman's work in anthropology was groundbreaking and his theories on political systems in Africa continue to be influential. He developed the concept of "rituals of rebellion," which describes how individuals and communities challenge the existing social order by creating rituals that subvert or challenge established power structures. He also developed the concept of "multi-tribal societies," which describes the complex social structures that exist in many African communities with multiple ethnic groups.</p><p>Gluckman had a profound impact beyond academia with his activism against apartheid. In the 1940s, he co-founded the anti-apartheid organization the Torch Commando and was involved with the African National Congress (ANC) in the 1950s. In 1964, Gluckman was among a group of activists who organized against the incarceration of Nelson Mandela on Robben Island.</p><p>Tragically, Gluckman passed away unexpectedly during a research trip to Zambia in 1975. His legacy continues to inspire and influence scholars and activists alike.</p><p></p><p>
