Jannings began his career in theater before transitioning to film, and eventually became a prominent figure in the German film industry. He worked with influential German filmmakers such as F.W. Murnau and Ernst Lubitsch, and also appeared in Hollywood productions such as "The Blue Angel" and "The Last Command." However, his association with the Nazi regime in Germany during the 1930s damaged his career and reputation, and he moved to Austria where he continued to work in film until his death in 1950.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=106405" title="Wikipedia article about Emil Jannings">Emil Jannings on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/iranian-actresses-died-in-2001.html' title='Iranian actresses died in 2001'><strong>Iranian actresses died in 2001</strong> List of the top 1 Iranian actresses who died in 2001</a></li><li><a href='/american-musicians-died-in-laryngeal-cancer.html' title='American musicians died in Laryngeal Cancer'><strong>American musicians died in Laryngeal Cancer</strong> List of the top 30 American music stars who died in Laryngeal Cancer</a></li><li><a href='/pakistani-actors-died-in-1998.html' title='Pakistani actors died in 1998'><strong>Pakistani actors died in 1998</strong> List of the top 1 Pakistani actors who died in 1998</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/german-actors-died-at-age-36.html' title='German actors died at age 36'><strong>German actors died at age 36</strong> List of the top 1 German actors who died when they were 36</a></li><li><a href='/brazilian-actors-died-in-1970.html' title='Brazilian actors died in 1970'><strong>Brazilian actors died in 1970</strong> List of the top 1 Brazilian actors who died in 1970</a></li><li><a href='/venezuelan-musicians-died-in-alzheimer-s-disease.html' title='Venezuelan musicians died in Alzheimer's disease'><strong>Venezuelan musicians died in Alzheimer's disease</strong> List of the top 1 Venezuelan music stars who died in Alzheimer's disease</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
