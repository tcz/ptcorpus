(September 4, 1896		Marseille-March 4, 1948			Ivry-sur-Seine)

	
		also known as Artaud, Antonin, Antoine Marie Joseph Paul Artaud, Antoine Marie Joseph Artaud, Artaud A. or Artaud

	
was
a French
writer, actor, playwright, theatre director, poet and screenwriter.


					</p><p>He is best known for his theories on theater, which rejected realism and strived for a visceral and physical experience for both the performers and the audience. Artaud's most famous work, "The Theatre and Its Double," outlines his philosophy of the "Theatre of Cruelty," which aimed to shatter conventional audience expectations and provoke an emotional response through sound, movement, and imagery. Throughout his life, Artaud struggled with mental illness, which greatly influenced his creative output, and he spent much of his adult life in and out of psychiatric hospitals. Despite his troubled life, he remains an influential figure in the worlds of theater, art, and literature to this day.</p><p>Artaud's early life was marked by familial conflict and personal hardship. He was profoundly affected by the early death of his younger brother from meningitis, as well as his mother's subsequent withdrawal from the family. Artaud had a difficult relationship with his father, who placed great pressure on him to succeed academically, leading to frequent clashes between the two.</p><p>Despite these hardships, Artaud began to make a name for himself in the artistic world in Paris in the 1920s, where he associated with some of the most famous writers and artists of the day. He was a member of the Surrealist movement for a time, although his unconventional ideas often put him at odds with his fellow artists.</p><p>Throughout his career, Artaud was a polarizing figure, known for his fiery temperament and his dedication to his artistic vision. He frequently clashed with directors and producers, and his unconventional techniques often left actors feeling confused and alienated. Nevertheless, his impact on the world of theater has been profound, and his ideas continue to inspire artists and thinkers around the world.</p><p>Artaud's artistic output was diverse and prolific, encompassing not just theater but also poetry, prose, and film. He wrote and acted in a number of plays throughout his career, including "Jet of Blood," "The Cenci," and "The Seashell and the Clergyman." He also worked as a screenwriter, collaborating with directors such as Abel Gance and Carl Dreyer.</p><p>In addition to his artistic pursuits, Artaud was deeply interested in indigenous cultures and their traditional forms of performance. He frequently drew on these influences in his own work, incorporating elements of ritual and spiritual practice into his performances.</p><p>Throughout his life, Artaud struggled with addiction and mental illness, which led to several extended stays in psychiatric hospitals. He underwent a number of treatments, including electroshock therapy, and was often heavily medicated. Despite these struggles, he continued to produce art until his untimely death at the age of 51.</p><p>In the years since his death, Artaud's ideas about theater and performance have continued to resonate with artists around the world. His work has been the subject of numerous academic studies and artistic explorations, cementing his position as a truly groundbreaking and provocative figure in the history of theater and the arts.</p><p>Artaud's impact can still be seen today in experimental theater and performance art. Many contemporary artists cite him as an influence and continue to explore his ideas about breaking down boundaries between performer and audience, as well as his interest in exploring the limits of human experience. His legacy also extends to other fields, such as psychoanalysis and cultural studies, where his ideas about the body, language, and the unconscious have continued to be influential. Artaud's life and work are a testament to the power of artistic vision in the face of personal struggle, and serve as an inspiration to generations of artists who seek to challenge and transform the world around them.</p><p></p><p>
