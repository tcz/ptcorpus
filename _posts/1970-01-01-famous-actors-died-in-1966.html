							Craig is best known for his revolutionary work in modernizing and simplifying stage design, which he believed was essential in creating a more immersive and emotionally engaging experience for the audience. He was heavily influenced by the ideals of the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements, and sought to create a total work of art that would integrate all aspects of the theatrical production.</p><p>In addition to his work as a stage designer, Craig also wrote extensively on the theory and practice of theatre, advocating for a radical departure from traditional, naturalistic acting and staging. He believed that theatre should strive for a heightened, poetic style that would elevate the emotions of the audience and transport them beyond mundane reality.</p><p>Despite his groundbreaking contributions to the theatre world, Craig was notoriously disorganized and frequently clashed with his collaborators. He also struggled with selling his ideas and designs to mainstream producers and often found himself relegated to producing experimental works in smaller, alternative venues. Nevertheless, his legacy continues to inspire generations of designers, directors, and artists to challenge conventions and push the boundaries of what is possible in theatre.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=331073" title="Wikipedia article about Edward Gordon Craig">Edward Gordon Craig on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Herbert Marshall</h2><p><strong>Herbert Marshall</strong>
