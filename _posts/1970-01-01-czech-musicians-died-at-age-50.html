(December 13, 1900		Prague-October 1, 1951			Prague)


was
a Czech
journalist and photographer.


					</p><p>Teige was also a leading figure in the Czech avant-garde movement and played a significant role in the development of modern art and design in Czechoslovakia during the 1920s and 1930s. He co-founded the Devětsil group, which was known for its eclectic approach to art and literature, and later became the editor of the influential journal ReD (Revolutionary Front of Artistic Innovation). In addition to his work in the arts, Teige was also a prolific writer and translator, and he translated works by notable authors such as James Joyce and Virginia Woolf into Czech. He was known for his leftist political views, which often found expression in his artistic and literary work. Despite his many accomplishments, Teige fell out of favor with the Communist government after World War II and was subjected to censorship and persecution, which worsened his already-poor health. He died of a heart attack in 1951 at the age of 50.</p><p>Teige's influence on the avant-garde movement in Czechoslovakia was immense. He believed in the power of modern design and architecture to transform society and advocated for the integration of art into everyday life. Teige was also interested in the surrealist movement and incorporated elements of surrealism into his work. He co-authored the influential book "Minimum Dwelling" with architect and designer Jiří Kroha, which focused on the design of affordable and efficient housing. Teige's work has been exhibited in museums and galleries around the world, and his legacy continues to inspire artists, designers, and architects today.</p><p></p><p>

writer, film director, screenwriter and playwright.


					</p><p>He studied law and economics at Charles University in Prague, but after completing his studies, he turned his attention to literature and the arts.

He is perhaps best known for his 1933 film "Marketa Lazarová," an epic historical drama set in medieval Bohemia. </p><p>Vančura was also involved in politics and was a member of the leftist Czechoslovak National Socialist Party. During World War II, he participated in the resistance against Nazi occupation, and he was ultimately arrested and executed by the Gestapo in 1942. His legacy as a writer and filmmaker continues to be celebrated in Czech culture today.</p><p>Vančura's literary work was varied and stylistically innovative, spanning poetry, prose, and drama. He was known for his experimental use of language, incorporating regional dialects and colloquialisms into his writing. His most famous works include the novel "Rozmarné léto" (Capricious Summer), the play "Vlasta," and the collection of short stories "Pekař Jan Marhoul" (Baker Jan Marhoul).</p><p>As a filmmaker, Vančura brought a similarly experimental approach to his work, experimenting with visual style and storytelling techniques. In addition to "Marketa Lazarová," he also directed the films "Vyšší princip" (Higher Principle) and "Křížová cesta" (The Procession). </p><p>Vančura's political beliefs often found their way into his work, and he was a vocal critic of fascism and authoritarianism. He joined the Czechoslovak National Socialist Party in the 1930s, but left after becoming disillusioned with the party's tactics. During the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, Vančura participated in resistance activities, including writing anti-fascist propaganda and working to smuggle people across the border.</p><p>Vančura's tragic death at the hands of the Gestapo has made him a symbol of the Czech resistance and a celebrated figure in Czech literature and culture. His work continues to be praised for its experimental style and its insights into the complexities of Czech history and society.</p><p></p><p>
