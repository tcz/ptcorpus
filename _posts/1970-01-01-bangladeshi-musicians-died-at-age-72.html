He was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan in 1954 and served as the Governor of East Pakistan from 1956 to 1957.</p><p>Husain's support for Bengali nationalism grew stronger in the 1960s, as he became increasingly disillusioned with the West Pakistani-dominated government. He played a key role in the Six Point Movement, which demanded greater autonomy for East Pakistan and eventually led to the creation of Bangladesh.</p><p>In 1971, when Pakistan launched a brutal crackdown on East Pakistan, Husain was chosen as Acting President of Bangladesh by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was then in prison. However, he was soon arrested by the Pakistani military and taken to a detention center in Chittagong.

His legacy continues to inspire future generations of Bangladeshis to strive for a just and democratic society.</p><p>Husain was also a skilled writer and journalist, having worked as an editor for several newspapers and magazines, including The Comrade and The Moslem Outlook. He used his platform to spread the message of Indian independence and championed the rights of marginalized communities, including women and farmers. </p><p>In addition to his political and journalistic career, Husain was a respected academic and scholar. He served as a professor of medieval Indian history and vice chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University. He was a respected authority on the subjects of medieval Indian culture and education and authored several books and scholarly articles on the topics. </p><p>Today, Husain's contributions to the struggle for Bangladeshi independence are honored through various institutions, including the Zakir Husain Institute of Islamic Studies at Jamia Millia Islamia University in India, the Zakir Husain College in Delhi, and the Zakir Husain Memorial Museum in Chittagong. His legacy continues to inspire people around the world to fight for freedom and justice.</p><p>In addition to his political and academic pursuits, Zakir Husain was deeply committed to social work and philanthropy. He established several organizations to support education, healthcare, and poverty reduction in his native Chittagong and other parts of Bengal. One of his most notable philanthropic endeavors was the establishment of the Zakir Husain Trust, which provided financial assistance to poor students and supported the development of educational institutions across the region. His tireless efforts to uplift the poor and disadvantaged have made him a revered figure among the people of Bangladesh and a symbol of hope for millions around the world.
