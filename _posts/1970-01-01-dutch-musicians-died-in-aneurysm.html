						</p><p>Albert Mol was a multifaceted personality who not only excelled in acting but was also a popular television presenter, writer, and singer. He was trained as an actor at the Toneelschool Amsterdam, and following his graduation, he joined the Nederlandse Comedie, one of the foremost Dutch theatre companies of the time. </p><p>Mol rose to fame with his stage performances in several plays, including 'Othello,' 'King Lear,' and 'The Importance of Being Earnest.' Later, he transitioned to the small screen and became a well-known television host, presenting several shows such as 'Wie van de Drie' and 'Zo is het toevallig ook nog eens een keer.' </p><p>Apart from his successful career in entertainment, Mol was also openly gay and a vocal LGBT rights activist. He wrote a book about his experiences in the closet and coming out called 'Gijzelaar' (Hostage) and even recorded a song called 'The Laughing Policeman,' which humorously mocked the Dutch police's obsession with arresting homosexuals. </p><p>In recognition of his contributions to Dutch culture, Mol was awarded several honours during his lifetime, including the Silver medal of the City of Amsterdam and the Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau. He remained active in the entertainment industry until the last years of his life, performing on stage until shortly before his death in March 2004.</p><p>In addition to his talents as an actor and presenter, Albert Mol also made a name for himself as a writer. He wrote several plays, including 'De Kat op de Snelweg' (The Cat on the Highway) and 'Dubbele Harten' (Double Hearts), which were met with critical acclaim. He also wrote a number of novels, including 'Knielen op een bed violen' (Kneeling on a Bed of Violets) which was later adapted into a successful film. Mol was not only a pioneering figure in Dutch entertainment; he was also a trailblazer for the LGBT community. He openly discussed his own experiences as a homosexual man and helped to raise awareness of LGBT rights and issues in the Netherlands. For his contributions to the gay community, he was awarded the Bob Angelo Medal in 1983, an award named after a pioneering Dutch gay rights activist. Despite facing some initial pushback, Mol's courage and charisma helped to change attitudes towards homosexuality in Dutch society. Today, he is remembered not only as a beloved entertainer but also as a pioneer and activist who helped to make the Netherlands more inclusive and accepting.</p><p>Throughout his career, Albert Mol worked in a variety of mediums, including film. He appeared in several movies, such as 'Fanfare,' 'Ciske de Rat,' and 'The Assault.' In 'Fanfare,' Mol played the role of a trumpet player, which also allowed him to showcase his musical talents. He also lent his voice to the Dutch version of Disney's 'Robin Hood' in 1973, portraying the character of Friar Tuck.</p><p>Aside from his artistic pursuits, Mol was also an avid traveler and adventurer. He went on several expeditions to the Himalayas, where he climbed mountains and trekked through remote regions. He chronicled his travels in a book called 'Hamer en Sikkel in de Himalaja' (Hammer and Sickle in the Himalayas).</p><p>Albert Mol's lasting legacy extends beyond his artistic and personal accomplishments. He is regarded as an icon for the Dutch LGBT community, inspiring many with his bravery, candor, and dedication to social justice. In 2013, the Amsterdam Museum mounted an exhibition dedicated to his life and work, titled "Albert Mol - Een Leven vol Avonturen" (Albert Mol - A Life Full of Adventures).</p><p>Mol was also known for his unique and flamboyant fashion sense, often sporting colorful and eccentric outfits. He once famously attended the Cannes Film Festival wearing a full, traditional Dutch costume. Mol's style and personality made him a beloved figure not only in entertainment but also in Dutch popular culture as a whole. In addition, Mol was a polyglot and spoke several languages fluently, which served him well in his travels and international career. His work continues to be celebrated in the Netherlands, and his legacy as an entertainer, writer, activist, and adventurer endures as a testament to a life filled with passion, creativity, and social impact.</p><p></p><p>
