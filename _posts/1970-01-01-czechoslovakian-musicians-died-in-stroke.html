(May 15, 1903		Tarnów-February 28, 1987			Hollenstedt)

	
		also known as Anna Sophie Ondrakova, Any Ondra, A. Ondráková, Anny Ondráková, Anna Ondráková or Anna Sophie Ondráková

	
was
a Czechoslovakian
actor and film producer.


					</p><p>She began her career in the Czech film industry, and gained international recognition when she starred in Alfred Hitchcock's first sound film, "Blackmail" (1929). After the film's success, she moved to London and appeared in several British films throughout the 1930s. Ondra was known for her beauty and her ability to play a wide range of characters, from innocent young women to femme fatales. In addition to her acting career, she also produced several films in the 1940s. Despite her success in the film industry, Ondra was known for her reclusive nature and shunned public attention. She retired from acting in the 1950s and lived a quiet life with her husband, boxer Max Schmeling, until her death in 1987.</p><p>Anny Ondra was born as Anna Sophie Ondrakova in Tarnów, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now in Poland. She was the daughter of a wealthy Czech family and grew up in Prague, where she studied acting at the National Academy of Dramatic Arts. Her first film role was in the Czech film "A Daughter of Luxury" (1926), directed by Karel Lamač. She soon became a popular actress in Czechoslovakia, known for her charm, wit, and versatility.</p><p>In 1929, Alfred Hitchcock saw Ondra in a film and was impressed by her screen presence. He cast her as Alice White in his film "Blackmail," which was both a critical and commercial success. The film was notable for being Hitchcock's first sound film and for featuring a famous scene in which Ondra's character is menaced by a knife-wielding artist. Although Ondra spoke English with a heavy Czech accent, her performance was well-received and she became a star in Britain.</p><p>Ondra went on to make several more British films, including "The Manxman" (1929), "The First Mrs. Fraser" (1932), and "The Private Life of Henry VIII" (1933), opposite Charles Laughton. In the latter film, she played Laughton's fourth wife, Anne of Cleves. Ondra's career as an actress slowed down in the late 1930s, and she produced several films, including "Journey Together" (1945), a war drama directed by John Boulting.</p><p>In 1933, Ondra met the German boxer Max Schmeling, and the two began a romance. They married in 1938 and remained together until Schmeling's death in 2005. Ondra retired from acting in the 1950s and lived with her husband in Germany, where they ran a successful fashion business. Ondra remained a beloved figure in the Czech film industry, and in 2003, a commemorative plaque was installed at her birthplace in Tarnów.</p><p>Despite her success in the film industry, Ondra was known for her elusive nature and her reluctance to engage with the media or public events. She was famously shy and introverted, and her marriage to Schmeling only increased her desire to keep a low profile. Ondra's life with Schmeling was a quiet one, and the couple rarely granted interviews or appeared in public together. They lived in various locations throughout Germany, including Berlin and Hollenstedt, where they owned a popular pub that became a meeting place for many of Schmeling's old boxing friends.</p><p>In later years, Ondra focused on her fashion business and philanthropic work, supporting various causes related to women's health and education. She remained active in the industry, however, and continued to produce films and work behind the scenes. Ondra passed away in February 1987, and was buried in the same cemetery as her husband in Hollenstedt. Despite her reclusive nature, she remains an icon in the film industry, and her legacy continues to inspire generations of filmmakers and actors around the world.</p><p>Ondra's marriage to Max Schmeling was not without controversy. Schmeling was a prominent figure in Nazi Germany, and his association with the regime led to criticism from some quarters. Ondra herself was accused of being sympathetic to the regime, but there is no evidence to support this claim. Ondra and Schmeling's marriage was a happy one, and they remained devoted to each other throughout their lives.</p><p>After Schmeling's death in 2005, Ondra's name was once again in the headlines. It was revealed that the couple had been secretly supporting a Jewish family during the Holocaust, providing them with money and shelter. This act of bravery was unknown to the wider world until after Ondra's death.</p><p>Today, Ondra is remembered as one of the most talented actresses of her generation, and a trailblazer for women in the film industry. Her work in "Blackmail" helped to make Alfred Hitchcock a household name, and her ability to play a wide range of roles made her a sought-after actress in both Europe and the UK. Although she shunned the limelight in her later years, her impact on the film industry remains undiminished, and her legacy is a testament to her talent and determination.</p><p></p><p>
