						</p><p>Goulart served as the 24th President of Brazil from 1961 until he was overthrown in a military coup in 1964. He was known for advocating for social and political reforms, supporting workers' rights, and having close ties to labor unions. During his presidency, he implemented several policies aimed at reducing income inequality and improving access to education and healthcare for the poor. However, his leftist policies were seen as a threat to the military and business interests, leading to his ouster in 1964. Goulart went into exile in Uruguay until his death in 1976. Despite his short presidency and controversial legacy, Goulart remains a celebrated figure among many left-wing politicians and activists in Brazil.</p><p>Goulart began his political career in the 1940s as a member of the Brazilian Labor Party, and later joined the Brazilian Democratic Movement. He was elected to the National Congress in 1946 and quickly rose through the ranks to become a prominent figure in Brazilian politics.</p><p>In the early 1960s, Goulart faced mounting opposition from conservatives and military leaders who saw him as a threat to democracy and national security. He was often accused of being a communist sympathizer and undermining the country's democratic institutions.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Goulart continued to push for progressive policies and was widely admired by Brazil's working class and rural poor. He advocated for land reform, higher wages for workers, and improved social services for marginalized communities.</p><p>Goulart's presidency came to an abrupt end in 1964 when a military coup ousted him from power. He fled to Uruguay with his family and continued to advocate for democracy and social justice from abroad until his death.</p><p>Today, Goulart is remembered as a champion of progressive politics and an important figure in Brazil's struggle for democracy and social equality. Many Brazilians view him as a hero who fought against injustice and stood up for the rights of the working class.</p><p></p><p>

(April 27, 1756		Salvador-April 23, 1815			Lisbon)


was
a Brazilian
scientist.


					</p><p>Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira was a naturalist, explorer, and botanist who conducted scientific expeditions throughout the Amazon rainforest from 1783 to 1792. He was appointed by the Portuguese crown to lead an expedition to gather knowledge of the natural resources and peoples of the region. During his travels, Ferreira extensively studied the flora and fauna, collected hundreds of specimens, and recorded detailed observations of the Amazonian culture and way of life of the native tribes. His pioneering work helped lay the foundations for modern ethnobotany and remains an essential source of information for ecologists and historians. Ferreira's legacy includes the collection of specimens deposited in the National Museum of Brazil and the creation of several published works that documented his expeditions.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira was also an advocate for the rights of indigenous people. He recognized the devastating impact of colonialism on these communities and worked to document and preserve their cultures. Ferreira also served as a judge and prefect in Pará, Brazil, where he implemented policies to improve the living conditions of the local population. Despite his significant contributions, Ferreira's work was largely forgotten after his death, and his collections were neglected for many years. However, in recent decades, there has been renewed interest in Ferreira's expeditions, and efforts are underway to digitize and preserve his extensive collection of specimens and writings. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important naturalists and explorers of the Amazon and a pioneer in the field of ethnobotany.</p><p></p><p>
