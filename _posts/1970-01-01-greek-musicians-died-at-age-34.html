(December 1, 1790		Ithaca-June 5, 1825			Athens)

	
		also known as Odysseus Androutsos

	
was
a Greek
military officer.


					</p><p>He played a significant role in the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire. Androutsos is most famously known for leading the successful siege of the Acropolis in Athens in 1822, where he defeated a large Ottoman force despite being heavily outnumbered. He also played an important role in several other battles of the war, including the Battle of Dervenakia, where he led the Greek forces to victory against the Ottomans. </p><p>However, Androutsos' military and political career was also marked by controversy and conflict. He was involved in several disputes and power struggles with other Greek commanders, and was accused of using questionable tactics and methods in his military campaigns. Eventually, these disputes led to his downfall - in 1825 he was captured, imprisoned and later executed by his own compatriots, following a failed attempt to seize power in the newly formed Greek state. In spite of these controversial aspects of his legacy, Androutsos is still regarded as a hero by many Greeks, and his military leadership during the early years of the War of Independence is widely celebrated.</p><p>Androutsos was born on the island of Ithaca in 1790, which was then part of the Venetian Republic. He enlisted in the British Army as a teenager, where he gained experience that he would later put to use in the Greek War of Independence. After the outbreak of the revolution in 1821, Androutsos returned to Greece and quickly rose through the ranks of the military, becoming one of the most prominent commanders in the fight for independence.</p><p>In addition to his military exploits, Androutsos was also known for his leadership and organizational skills. He played a key role in the establishment of the Provisional Government of Greece, which was formed in 1822 to coordinate the efforts of the various rebel forces. He also helped to organize the first national assembly of Greece, which convened in 1822 to draft a constitution for the new state.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Androutsos' career was marked by a series of controversies and personal feuds. He was known for his fierce temper and stubbornness, which often put him at odds with his fellow commanders. He was also accused of using excessive force and tactics that violated the rules of war, leading some to question his commitment to the cause of Greek independence.</p><p>Despite these criticisms, however, Androutsos remains an important figure in Greek history and a symbol of the struggle for independence. His famous victory at the Acropolis is seen as a turning point in the war, and his leadership and organizational skills helped to lay the foundation for the modern Greek state. Today, he is remembered as a brave and innovative military commander who played a key role in securing Greece's freedom from Ottoman rule.</p><p></p><p>
