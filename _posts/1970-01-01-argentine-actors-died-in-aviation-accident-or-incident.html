							Gardel was considered one of the most prominent figures in the history of tango and is credited with popularizing the genre on an international level. He recorded over 700 songs during his career, many of which are now considered classics of the genre. He also starred in several films, including "Cuesta Abajo" and "El Dia Que Me Quieras," both of which were hugely successful in Argentina and helped to cement his status as a beloved icon in his home country. Despite his fame and success, Gardel's life was cut tragically short when he died in a plane crash in Medellín, Colombia in 1935 at the age of 44. He continues to be celebrated as one of the greatest tango performers of all time, and his influence can still be seen in the music of contemporary tango artists.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=252092" title="Wikipedia article about Carlos Gardel">Carlos Gardel on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/georgian-actresses-died-in-1984.html' title='Georgian actresses died in 1984'><strong>Georgian actresses died in 1984</strong> List of the top 1 Georgian actresses who died in 1984</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-actors-died-in-1985.html' title='Japanese actors died in 1985'><strong>Japanese actors died in 1985</strong> List of the top 7 Japanese actors who died in 1985</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-single-vehicle-accident.html' title='Famous actors died in Single-vehicle accident'><strong>Famous actors died in Single-vehicle accident</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actors who died in Single-vehicle accident</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/hongkongese-actors-died-at-age-44.html' title='Hongkongese actors died at age 44'><strong>Hongkongese actors died at age 44</strong> List of the top 1 Hongkongese actors who died when they were 44</a></li><li><a href='/south-african-actors-died-at-age-64.html' title='South African actors died at age 64'><strong>South African actors died at age 64</strong> List of the top 1 South African actors who died when they were 64</a></li><li><a href='/spanish-actors-died-at-age-61.html' title='Spanish actors died at age 61'><strong>Spanish actors died at age 61</strong> List of the top 6 Spanish actors who died when they were 61</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
