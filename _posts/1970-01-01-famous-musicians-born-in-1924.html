							</p><p>Haney initially began her career as a chorus dancer in musical films during the 1940s. However, she quickly gained recognition for her exceptional talent and began to receive more prominent roles in Broadway productions. She became famous for her role in the original Broadway production of "The Pajama Game," where she not only danced but also choreographed some of the numbers. She was even nominated for a Tony Award for her work in the production. </p><p>Haney then went on to choreograph and direct other successful productions such as "Funny Girl" and "Flower Drum Song." She also made numerous appearances on television shows such as "The Colgate Comedy Hour" and "Your Show of Shows."</p><p>Unfortunately, Haney's life was cut short at the age of 39 due to complications from surgery. Despite her relatively short career, Haney's influence in the entertainment industry is still recognized and celebrated today.</p><p>Haney was known for her unique and innovative choreography style, which combined classical dance with modern and jazz movements. Her work was often characterized by its athleticism and energy, and she was praised for her ability to showcase the skills and strengths of individual dancers. In addition to her work on stage and screen, Haney was also a respected teacher and mentor to many aspiring dancers, including Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon. Today, she is remembered as one of the most influential choreographers of her time, and her legacy continues to inspire new generations of performers.</p><p>Haney's talent was evident from a young age, as she began studying dance at the age of five. She continued her dance training throughout her school years and eventually attended the Boston Children's Theatre. After a brief stint working as a fashion model in New York City, Haney moved to Hollywood in pursuit of a career in show business.</p><p>One of Haney's most memorable performances came in the film "The Band Wagon," in which she played opposite Fred Astaire in the iconic "Triplets" number. The routine, which featured Haney, Astaire, and Nanette Fabray dressed as babies, was a critical and commercial success and remains a classic of the Hollywood musical genre.</p><p>Despite her success, Haney faced personal struggles throughout her life, including a battle with alcoholism. She ultimately sought treatment and was able to overcome her addiction, but tragically, she died just a few years later during a routine surgery.</p><p>Despite her untimely death, Haney's contributions to the world of dance and entertainment continue to be celebrated today. In addition to her work as a choreographer and performer, she was also a trailblazer, breaking down barriers for women and minority performers in a male-dominated industry. Today, her legacy lives on through the many performers she inspired and the numerous productions she helped to create.</p><p></p><p>
