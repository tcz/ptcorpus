					</p><p>Fazul Abdullah Mohammed was a notorious Al Qaeda operative and one of the key masterminds behind the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. He was on the FBIâ€™s most wanted list and was thought to have been involved in several other terrorist attacks as well. </p><p>Born in the Comoros Islands and raised in Mombasa, Kenya, Fazul Abdullah Mohammed was known to be highly educated with a degree in computer science. He had traveled extensively across the Middle East and South Asia and had received training in military tactics and explosives. </p><p>Fazul Abdullah Mohammed was killed in a shootout with Somali security forces in Mogadishu in 2011. His death was viewed as a significant blow to the Al Qaeda network in East Africa, and his legacy as a key figure in the global jihadist movement continues to be felt.</p><p>Fazul Abdullah Mohammed had a long and extensive history with Al Qaeda, and was believed to have served as a personal assistant to the group's leader, Osama bin Laden. He was also involved in the planning and execution of the 2002 Mombasa attacks, which targeted an Israeli-owned hotel and an Israeli charter plane, and the 2002 Paradise Hotel bombing in Kikambala, Kenya. In addition to his terrorist activities, Mohammed was also known to have been involved in smuggling and other criminal enterprises in East Africa.</p><p>Despite his notoriety, Fazul Abdullah Mohammed was able to avoid capture for many years, thanks in part to his ability to blend in with local populations and his frequent use of false documents. However, his luck ran out in 2011 when he was caught and killed by Somali security forces in Mogadishu. His death was seen as a major victory in the fight against terrorism, and many hoped that it would help to stem the tide of extremism in East Africa. However, the continued presence of radical groups in the region suggests that the fight is far from over.</p><p>Fazul Abdullah Mohammed's life and legacy continue to be studied by law enforcement agencies and experts in counterterrorism. His ability to evade capture for so long and his extensive connections within the global jihadist network have made him a cautionary tale for those trying to combat extremist groups. In addition, his involvement in criminal activities such as smuggling serves as a reminder of the complex and multifaceted nature of terror networks, which often rely on a wide range of illicit activities to fund their operations. </p><p>Despite the impact of his death, Mohammed's influence can still be seen in the activities of Al-Shabaab, the Al Qaeda affiliate in East Africa that he helped to create. The group remains a potent force in the region, carrying out frequent attacks on civilian and military targets alike. Additionally, the ongoing instability in Somalia and other East African nations continues to create opportunities for extremist groups to recruit new members and expand their reach. </p><p>Fazul Abdullah Mohammed's life and crimes stand as a testament to the ongoing challenges posed by the global jihad movement. While his death was a significant accomplishment in the fight against terrorism, it is clear that much work remains to be done to create a more stable and peaceful world.</p><p></p><p>
