(January 14, 1840		Sucre-February 27, 1894			Uyuni)

	
		a.k.a. Hilarion Daza

	
was
a Bolivian
politician.


					</p><p>Daza served as the President of Bolivia from 1876 to 1879. During his presidency, he implemented various modernization policies aimed at improving the country's infrastructure and economy. These policies, however, were not well received by some of Bolivia's feudal landowners, who saw them as a threat to their power.</p><p>In 1879, while Daza was still in power, Bolivia entered into a disastrous war with Chile that lasted for five years. Daza's leadership during the war was widely criticized, and he was accused of making critical military mistakes that ultimately led to Bolivia's defeat.</p><p>Following the war, Daza was exiled to France, where he attempted to organize a rebellion against the Bolivian government. In 1893, he returned to Bolivia but was quickly arrested and sentenced to death. Daza's sentence was commuted to life in prison, but he was assassinated by a fellow prisoner before he could serve his sentence.</p><p>Despite the controversial end to his political career, Hilarión Daza left a lasting impact on the development of Bolivia. His modernization policies, such as the construction of railways and telegraph lines, helped to improve communication and transportation throughout the country. Additionally, he established the Bolivian National Bank and increased public education funding. </p><p>Daza also had a significant role in shaping Bolivia's foreign policy. He hoped to expand Bolivia's territory by annexing neighboring countries and territories, such as the Atacama Desert in Chile. While this goal was not realized, his pro-nationalist stance set the tone for future Bolivian leaders. </p><p>Today, Daza is remembered as a complex figure in Bolivian history. While his attempts at modernization were necessary for the country's development, his autocratic leadership style and mistakes during the war with Chile have tarnished his legacy.</p><p>In addition to his political achievements, Hilarión Daza was also a military leader, rising to the rank of colonel before becoming involved in politics. He played a key role in repelling an invasion of Bolivia by Peru in 1879, just before the outbreak of the War of the Pacific with Chile. However, his military strategy during the war with Chile was heavily criticized, with many blaming his ego and lack of strategic planning for Bolivia's defeat. Despite this, Daza remained a popular figure among many Bolivians, particularly those from the lower classes, who saw him as a champion of modernization and national pride.</p><p>In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the life and legacy of Hilarión Daza, with some historians arguing that he has been unfairly maligned by a biased historical record. Others, however, maintain that his actions were responsible for exacerbating political and social divisions in Bolivia, and that his legacy remains a controversial and complex subject in Bolivian history. Regardless of these debates, it is clear that Daza played a significant role in shaping Bolivia's political and economic landscape, and that his impact continues to be felt in the country today.</p><p>During his time in exile in France, Hilarión Daza attempted to sell Bolivia's claims on the Atacama Desert to two British businessmen, which would have ceded control of the territory to Chile. This resulted in a scandal known as the "Chilean Daza Affair" and further damaged Daza's reputation. Additionally, some historians argue that Daza's modernization policies disproportionately benefited the wealthy elite and did not do enough to address the country's deep social and economic inequalities. Despite these criticisms, Daza remains a significant figure in Bolivian history and his presidency marked an important turning point in the country's development.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of assassination.
