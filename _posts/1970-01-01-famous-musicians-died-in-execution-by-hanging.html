(February 4, 1906		Wrocław-April 9, 1945			Flossenbürg)


was
a German
theologian, pastor and writer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his resistance against the Nazi regime during World War II, which ultimately led to his execution by hanging. Bonhoeffer was part of the Confessing Church, a movement within German Protestantism that opposed Hitler's attempt to centralize control of the church. He was involved in efforts to aid Jews and other oppressed groups, and eventually became involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler. Bonhoeffer's theological writings, which include "The Cost of Discipleship" and "Letters and Papers from Prison," continue to have a profound impact on Christian thought and practice today.</p><p>Bonhoeffer was born into a large family of intellectuals, with his father being a psychiatrist and professor of neurology. He studied theology in Berlin and was ordained as a Lutheran pastor in 1931. The rise of the Nazi party greatly troubled Bonhoeffer, and he quickly became involved in the Confessing Church, which was an underground movement of Christians dedicated to resisting Nazi control over the Church.</p><p>Bonhoeffer travelled to the United States in 1939 to teach at Union Theological Seminary in New York City, but he ultimately made the difficult decision to return to Germany and join the resistance movement against the Nazis. He was arrested in 1943 and imprisoned for two years, during which time he wrote extensively on Christian faith and persecution.</p><p>Bonhoeffer was ultimately executed on April 9, 1945, just weeks before the Allies liberated the camp where he was being held. His legacy lives on as a powerful example of Christian courage and resistance in the face of tyranny, and his theological writings continue to inspire people around the world.</p><p></p><p>
