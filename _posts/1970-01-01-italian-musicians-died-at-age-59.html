(June 9, 1898		Prato-July 19, 1957			Rome)

	
		also known as Kurt Eric Suckert

	
was
an Italian
writer, novelist, journalist and diplomat.


					</p><p>Malaparte was born into a bourgeois family and received a formal education in his youth. He initially pursued a career in journalism and politics, working as a correspondent during World War I and collaborating with Benito Mussolini's National Fascist Party in the early 1920s.</p><p>However, Malaparte eventually broke with the Party and became disillusioned with fascism. He began working as a freelance writer, producing a series of novels and essays that are characterized by their dark, satirical humor and their brutal, often surreal depictions of war and totalitarianism.</p><p>Malaparte's most famous novel, "Kaputt" (1944), is based on his experiences as a war correspondent on the Eastern Front during World War II. The novel has been praised for its unflinching portrayal of the atrocities committed by both the Axis and Allied forces, and for its bleak, absurdist vision of humanity.</p><p>Malaparte's later works include "The Skin" (1949), a novel set during the Allied occupation of Naples, and "The Forbidden Christ" (1951), an exploration of the contradictions and complexities of Catholicism in the modern world.</p><p>Malaparte's political and intellectual independence made him a controversial figure throughout his life, but his unique perspective and powerful writing continue to attract readers and scholars today.</p><p>Malaparte's career as a diplomat began in the 1930s when he served as the Italian consul in Shanghai, China. He was later expelled from China by the nationalist government for his criticism of fascist policies. Malaparte also briefly served as an Italian delegate to the United Nations in 1950, but he was once again dismissed due to his opposition to the government's policies.Malaparte's works were often controversial, in part because of his critical views on fascism and totalitarianism. He was imprisoned by the Fascist government several times and was put under house arrest in 1933. After the fall of Mussolini, Malaparte was briefly imprisoned by the new government before being released. He died in Rome in 1957 of lung cancer.</p><p></p><p>
