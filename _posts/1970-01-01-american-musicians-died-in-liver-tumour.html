He was a switch-hitter who could hit for both power and average, and he also had exceptional speed, making him a skilled baserunner and outfielder. Mantle won three American League MVP awards, was named to the All-Star team 20 times, and helped lead the Yankees to seven World Series championships. He finished his career with 536 home runs, 1,509 RBIs, and a batting average of .298. Despite his success on the field, Mantle struggled with alcoholism throughout his life and suffered from numerous health issues as a result. After his retirement, he became an advocate for sobriety, and his legacy as a baseball legend continues to be celebrated today.</p><p>In addition to his impressive career statistics, Mantle was also known for his incredible performances in major games. In Game 2 of the 1956 World Series, Mantle hit a home run that reportedly traveled 450 feet, earning him the nickname "The Commerce Comet." He also famously hit a home run in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, although the Yankees ultimately lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in that series.</p><p>Mantle's legacy as a baseball icon continued long after his retirement. In 1974, he was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and his No. 7 jersey was retired by the Yankees. In 1994, he was diagnosed with liver cancer and received a liver transplant in June of that year. However, his health continued to decline, and he passed away just over a year later at the age of 63.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced in his personal life, Mantle's talent on the baseball field and his unwavering dedication to the sport continue to inspire generations of athletes and fans alike.</p><p>Following his retirement from baseball, Mickey Mantle worked as a TV commentator and made numerous public appearances at baseball events.

The couple had four sons together, but Mantle also had several extramarital affairs throughout his life. He admitted to being unfaithful in his autobiography, "The Mick," which was published in 1985.</p><p>Despite his flaws, Mickey Mantle remains a beloved figure in the world of baseball and a true American icon. His incredible talent on the field and his perseverance through personal struggles have made him an inspiration to many, and his legacy continues to live on through the countless fans and players who have been touched by his story.</p><p>During his baseball career, Mickey Mantle became known for breaking records and setting new ones. He still holds the record for the longest home run in Major League Baseball history, a legendary blast that traveled 643 feet at Washington's Griffith Stadium. He also broke Joe DiMaggio's record for consecutive games with a hit by recording a hit in 11 straight games, and he set new World Series records for home runs (18), RBIs (40), runs scored (42), walks (43), and total bases (123). Mantle was also known for his intense work ethic, often arriving at the ballpark early to take extra practice swings or work on his fielding.</p><p>Mantle's impact on the game of baseball extended far beyond his own career. He inspired countless young players to follow in his footsteps, and his approach to the game helped to shape the way that baseball is played today. He was also a trailblazer for athletes who were able to achieve fame and success during the era of segregation and discrimination.</p><p>After his death, Mantle's legacy continued to grow as new generations of fans discovered his incredible talent and inspiring story. He has been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries, and his name is synonymous with the very best of baseball. Today, Mickey Mantle remains one of the most beloved and celebrated figures in the history of American sports.</p><p></p><p>

was
an American
actor, screenwriter, television producer, television director and film producer.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Ricky Nelson and David Nelson.

						</p><p>Ozzie Nelson was best known for his role as the patriarch in the popular 1950s sitcom, "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet," which also starred his wife, Harriet Nelson, and their real-life sons, Ricky and David. The show ran for over a decade and was one of the longest-running sitcoms in American television history. </p><p>Before his successful career in television, Ozzie was a talented musician and bandleader, leading his own orchestra in the 1930s and 1940s. He also wrote and produced several films, including "Here Come the Nelsons" (1952), which starred his family. </p><p>Ozzie and Harriet Nelson were known as one of Hollywood's happiest and most enduring couples, having been married for over 30 years until Ozzie's passing in 1975 at the age of 69. In addition to his successful entertainment career, Ozzie was a dedicated family man and active in various philanthropic causes throughout his lifetime.</p><p>Ozzie Nelson was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and grew up in Ridgefield Park. He attended Rutgers University on a football scholarship but left before graduating to pursue a career in music. He landed his first job as a saxophonist in a band led by legendary bandleader, Ted Lewis. Ozzie later formed his own orchestra, which became popular with dance enthusiasts across the country. He recorded several hits, including "And Then Some" and "You Are My Lucky Star."</p><p>In the 1940s, Ozzie turned his attention to Hollywood and began working as a screenwriter and film producer. He produced and co-wrote the comedy film, "The Remarkable Andrew" (1942), which starred William Holden. Ozzie also wrote and produced several short films, including "Stone Age Romeos" (1955), which was included in the television series, "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet."</p><p>Ozzie's greatest success, however, came with "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet," which debuted on radio in 1944 and later migrated to television in 1952. The show was a hit with audiences and ran for 14 seasons, making it one of the longest-running shows on American television. The show's success was due in no small part to the Nelsons' real-life chemistry and the fact that the show's storylines often mirrored their own lives. Ozzie played a loving, but somewhat bumbling husband and father, while his wife, Harriet, played a supportive and caring wife and mother. Their sons, Ricky and David, also appeared on the show, first as children and later as teenagers. </p><p>In addition to his work in entertainment, Ozzie was an avid baseball fan and served as a member of the Board of Directors for the Pacific Coast League. He was also actively involved in several charitable organizations, including the American Cancer Society and the March of Dimes. </p><p>Ozzie Nelson's legacy as a beloved television icon and accomplished musician and producer continues to live on today.</p><p>In addition to his work in the entertainment industry and philanthropy, Ozzie Nelson also served in the United States Army during World War II. He enlisted in 1942 and worked as a morale officer, entertaining troops with his music and comedy performances. After his service, he continued to support the military through various events and fundraisers.</p><p>Ozzie and Harriet's real-life marriage was also a notable feature of their television show. The couple often demonstrated a deep love and affection for each other onscreen, which was uncommon for television at the time. This onscreen portrayal of a happy and stable family helped to shape American views on marriage and family life.</p><p>Sadly, Ozzie Nelson passed away in 1975 due to complications from liver cancer. He was survived by his wife, Harriet, and their two sons, Ricky and David. Despite his passing, his legacy as a television pioneer and beloved patriarch remains strong in American pop culture.</p><p>In addition to his successful career in entertainment, Ozzie Nelson was also an accomplished author. He wrote several books, including "Ozzie's Girls" (1960), which chronicled his family and their experiences in show business. The book was a best-seller and gave readers a glimpse into the private lives of the Nelson family. Ozzie was also a talented golfer and enjoyed playing the sport in his spare time.</p><p>After Ozzie's passing, his wife Harriet continued to make appearances on television, including several guest spots on "The Love Boat" and "Fantasy Island." She remained a beloved figure in Hollywood until her own passing in 1994. Their sons, Ricky and David, also followed in their parents' footsteps and pursued successful careers in entertainment.</p><p>Today, "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" remains a cultural touchstone and a testament to the enduring popularity of the traditional family sitcom. Ozzie Nelson's legacy as a talented musician, producer, and writer, as well as his influence on the television industry, continues to be felt to this day.</p><p></p><p>
