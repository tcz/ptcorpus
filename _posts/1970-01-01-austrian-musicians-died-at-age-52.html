was
an Austrian
writer and journalist.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Heinrich Gustav Hellmuth Bettauer and Reginald Parker Bettauer.

						</p><p>Bettauer was a prolific writer, having penned more than 20 novels and plays. His most famous work is the novel "Die Stadt ohne Juden" (The City Without Jews), which was published in 1922. The novel depicts a fictional scenario in which all Jewish people are expelled from Vienna, leading to chaos and economic collapse. Sadly, the novel predicted the real events that would unfold in Austria in the 1930s as the Nazis rose to power. </p><p>In addition to his career as a writer, Bettauer was also a well-known journalist and publisher. He was the founder of several newspapers, including the weekly political magazine "Der Querschnitt" and the daily newspaper "Der Kikeriki". </p><p>Bettauer's life came to a tragic end when he was shot and killed by a young Austrian Nazi sympathizer. The murder was politically motivated, as Bettauer had become a vocal critic of the rising fascist movement in Austria. His death was mourned by many and remains a poignant reminder of the dangers of extremism and intolerance.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in homicide.

was
an Austrian
scientist.


					</p><p>Zilsel studied at the University of Vienna, where he received his doctorate in philosophy in 1919. He is best known for his contributions to the philosophy of science and social epistemology, particularly his work on the relationship between science and society. He also worked as a science journalist and translator, translating works of Einstein and Planck into German. Zilsel's work was greatly influenced by his experiences growing up in a Jewish family in Vienna during a time of rising anti-Semitism. His suicide is believed to have been a result of his fears of being swept up in the Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II. Despite his relatively short career, Zilsel's work has had a lasting influence on the philosophy of science and social epistemology.</p><p></p><p>
