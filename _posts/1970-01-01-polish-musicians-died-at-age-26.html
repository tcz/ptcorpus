was
a Polish
personality.


					
			
		She had
		one
		child,
		Valdemar the Young.

						</p><p>Dagmar of Bohemia was born as the daughter of King Ottokar I of Bohemia and his second wife, Constance of Hungary. She was also known as Margaret and was a member of the Přemyslid dynasty. In 1204, she married King Valdemar II of Denmark, a marriage that was arranged to strengthen relations between Denmark and Bohemia. </p><p>Despite the fact that Dagmar was initially met with hostility by the Danish people due to her foreign background, she soon won the hearts of the Danes with her kindness and generosity. Her marriage to Valdemar II was considered happy, and the couple had one child, Valdemar the Young.</p><p>Dagmar was known for her piety and charitable works, and was especially interested in helping the sick and poor. She also founded hospitals and churches, and is said to have been instrumental in bringing the Dominicans to Denmark. </p><p>Unfortunately, Dagmar's life was cut short when she died in 1212 while giving birth to her second child. She was buried in the church of St. Bendt in Ringsted, Denmark, and her tomb soon became a place of pilgrimage. Today, she is venerated as a saint in Denmark and is commonly known as Saint Dagmar.</p><p>Following her death, Dagmar's reputation as a saintly figure grew rapidly. Many legends and miracles were attributed to her, and her tomb became a popular pilgrimage site. In fact, her remains were moved several times over the centuries to accommodate the many visitors who came to pay their respects. In 1595, her tomb was opened and her body was found to be remarkably well-preserved, leading many to believe that she was indeed a holy woman. Today, a street in Copenhagen is named after Saint Dagmar, and she is one of the few medieval Danish queens to be remembered and celebrated as a saint. Her legacy as a generous and compassionate figure who dedicated her life to helping others continues to inspire people in Denmark and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
