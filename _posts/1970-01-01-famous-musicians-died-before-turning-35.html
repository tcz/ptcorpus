He was born on 5th April 1796 in London, England. He had an immense interest in the natural world from his childhood and thus, he went on to study natural history and botany at various universities across Europe.</p><p>He was one of the founding members of the Royal Geographic Society and went on many expeditions to explore the flora and fauna of uncharted territories. His notable works include ‘Observations on Natural History’ and ‘A Guide to Zoology and Botany of Chatham Island’.</p><p>Tragically, Foster lost his life at the young age of 34 due to drowning while on a scientific expedition to the coast of New Zealand. His contributions to the field of natural history and exploration are still remembered and celebrated to this day.</p><p>Foster's expeditions took him to several regions of the world, including South America, Africa, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand, where he met with the native populations and learned about their cultures, languages and customs. He collected and studied various plant and animal specimens and contributed significantly to the understanding of the natural world.</p><p>Foster was also a pioneer in using photography as a tool for scientific documentation. He took numerous photographs during his expeditions, depicting landscapes, animals and people, which were later used in scientific publications and ethnographic studies.</p><p>Foster's legacy in the fields of botany and zoology lives on through the many species of plants and animals that were named after him, such as the Foster's skink, Foster's palm, and Foster's comorant. His contributions to science and exploration continue to inspire new generations of scientists and adventurers.</p><p>Foster was married to Emma Mary Tennant, a botanist, with whom he shared a passion for natural history. Together, they collaborated on several scientific papers and collections of plant specimens, including a four-volume work on the flora of Jamaica. Emma continued his work after his death, publishing many of his findings and papers posthumously. </p><p>Foster's influence extended beyond the scientific community, as he was also a member of the literary society, the Athenaeum. He wrote poetry, essays and travelogue accounts of his expeditions, which were published in various journals and newspapers of the time. He was admired for his eloquent and vivid descriptions of the places he visited and the people he met.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to science, Foster was awarded the Royal Medal by the Royal Society in 1830, just a year before he passed away. His premature death was a great loss to the scientific community, but his legacy lives on through his pioneering work in natural history and exploration.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Dr. Alfred Jarry

	
was
a French
writer, physician and playwright.


					</p><p>Jarry was one of the founders of the modernist literary movement, influencing the likes of James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, and Marcel Duchamp. He is perhaps best known for his play "Ubu Roi," which was first performed in 1896 and caused a scandal with its controversial content and crude language. Jarry's work often dealt with themes of absurdity and surrealism, and he is considered a precursor to the Theater of the Absurd. In addition to writing, Jarry dabbled in art and music, and was known for his eccentric personality and fondness for absinthe. Despite his short life and relatively small body of work, Jarry's impact on modern art and literature is significant.</p><p>Jarry began his literary career as a young man, contributing articles and stories to local newspapers and journals. He eventually moved to Paris to study medicine, but quickly became more interested in the city's cultural scene. It was there that he began to develop his own unique style of writing, characterized by a blend of literary genres and an emphasis on language and wordplay. Alongside "Ubu Roi," Jarry's other major works include "Gestes et Opinions du Docteur Faustroll, Pataphysicien" and "Messalina." </p><p>Jarry's influence can still be seen in contemporary art and literature, with many writers and artists continuing to draw inspiration from his work. In addition to his impact on modernist literature, Jarry's contributions to the art world also played a significant role in the development of surrealism, Dadaism, and other avant-garde movements. Jarry's life and work continue to be celebrated through various artistic and cultural events around the world, cementing his legacy as one of the most innovative and influential figures of the modern era.</p><p>Jarry's personal life was also marked by financial struggles and tumultuous relationships. He was often in debt and relied heavily on the support of friends and family. Jarry was openly bisexual, which is reflected in some of his writing, and he had a number of affairs throughout his life. He was also known for his reckless behavior, including his fondness for carrying a loaded revolver with him at all times. Despite his eccentricities, Jarry was well-respected by his peers, and many credited him with changing the course of French literature and theater. Today, Jarry is remembered as a pioneering figure in the development of modern art and literature, and his work continues to inspire and educate new generations of writers and artists around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1585		Taurisano-February 9, 1619			Toulouse)


was
an Italian
astrologer.


					</p><p>Vanini was also a philosopher and a scholar of natural science. He is known for his controversial writings, which often promoted atheism and challenged traditional religious beliefs. Vanini believed that the universe was governed by natural laws, rather than divine intervention. He was known for his bold and controversial views on religion, which ultimately led to his arrest and execution by the Inquisition in 1619. Despite his controversial beliefs, Vanini's works have had a significant impact on the development of modern science and philosophy.</p><p>Vanini was born in a small town in southern Italy and received his early education from the Jesuits. He later attended the University of Padua, where he began to develop his interest in natural science and astronomy. After completing his studies, he moved to France, where he gained a reputation as a skilled astrologer and became a popular lecturer at the University of Toulouse.</p><p>Vanini's most famous work was "De Admirandis Naturae Reginae Deaeque Mortalium Arcanis", or "Concerning the Secrets of the Queen of the Natural and Mortal Gods". The book, which was published in 1616, was a controversial critique of traditional Christian beliefs and argued that the universe was a self-sufficient system that did not require any divine intervention.</p><p>Vanini was arrested in 1618 on charges of blasphemy and atheism. He was subjected to a long and grueling trial by the Inquisition, during which he refused to recant his views. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by burning at the stake. Vanini's execution made him a martyr for the cause of free thought and religious tolerance, and his ideas continued to influence the development of European philosophy and science for centuries.</p><p>Vanini's ideas and writings were not only deemed heretical by the church, but also challenged conventional thinking in the scientific community. In addition to his beliefs on natural laws governing the universe, he also rejected the Aristotelian view of the four elements and instead proposed a theory of a continuous substance that could transform into different forms. Vanini was also one of the first to propose a theory of the evolution of species, centuries before Charles Darwin published "On the Origin of Species."</p><p>Despite his controversial ideas and untimely death, Vanini's impact on the scientific and philosophical world cannot be denied. His works were rare and difficult to obtain, but they inspired a generation of free thinkers and influenced the Age of Enlightenment. In the 19th century, Vanini was rediscovered by scholars and his writings were republished and studied extensively. Today, he is recognized as one of the most important and influential philosophers of the early modern period.</p><p></p><p>
