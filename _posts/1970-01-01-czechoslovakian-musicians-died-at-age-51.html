(July 31, 1901		Nezvěstice-December 3, 1952			Prague)

a Czechoslovakian
politician.


					
			
		He had
		three
		children,
		Naďa Slánský, Rudolf Nadezhda Slánský and Marta Slánský.

						</p><p>Slánský was a prominent member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and served as its General Secretary from 1945 until 1951. He played an important role in the post-World War II reconstruction of Czechoslovakia and was considered a loyal supporter of the Soviet Union. However, in 1951, he was arrested on charges of being a "Zionist agent" and involved in a "Trotskyite-Titoite-Zionist conspiracy" against the Czechoslovak Communist government. Slánský was one of 14 high-ranking officials and Jewish leaders who were tried and sentenced in a show trial that was widely seen as a Stalinist purge.</p><p>Despite international protests, Slánský was executed in 1952 and subsequently rehabilitated in 1963 after the political thaw of the early 1960s. The trial and execution of Slánský and other defendants in the show trial became a symbol of Communist repression and anti-Semitism in Czechoslovakia and contributed to a decline in the popularity of the Communist government.</p><p></p><p>

During World War II, he was deported to Terezin concentration camp and later to Auschwitz, where he survived as a member of the camp orchestra.</p><p>After the war, Jurovsky returned to Czechoslovakia and continued to work as a composer, producing music for films, plays, and operas.
