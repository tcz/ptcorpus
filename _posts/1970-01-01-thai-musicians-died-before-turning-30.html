(September 20, 1925		Heidelberg-June 9, 1946			Grand Palace)

	
		a.k.a. Rama VIII or King Ananda Mahidol

	
was
a Thai
personality.


					</p><p>Ananda Mahidol was the 8th monarch of Thailand, ascending to the throne in 1935 at the age of 8 after his uncle, King Prajadhipok, abdicated. As a child king, he did not hold much political power, but was well-loved by the Thai people. In 1945, he returned to Thailand from Switzerland after finishing his studies but was met with political turmoil as the country transitioned from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy. </p><p>Ananda Mahidol's death in 1946 was surrounded by controversy and speculation. He was found dead in his bed at the Grand Palace with a gunshot wound to the head, and it was officially ruled as an accident. However, many people believe that he was assassinated, although no one has been able to prove it conclusively. </p><p>Despite his short reign and mysterious death, Ananda Mahidol is still revered by many Thais as a symbol of unity and stability during a difficult time in the country's history. His younger brother, Bhumibol Adulyadej, succeeded him to the throne and became the longest-reigning monarch in Thai history.</p><p>An investigation was made into Ananda Mahidol's death, but it did not provide any clear answers. Some have speculated that his death was part of a larger political conspiracy, while others believe that he accidentally shot himself while playing with his gun. The circumstances of his death continue to be a topic of debate and controversy in Thailand. Despite his untimely death, Ananda Mahidol left a lasting legacy in Thailand. He was known for his love of music, and several schools and institutions have been named in his honor. Additionally, his dedication to education and commitment to democratic ideals have been an inspiration to many in the country. Today, he is remembered as an important figure in Thai history and a symbol of the nation's resilience during times of political turbulence.</p><p>Ananda Mahidol's legacy also includes the establishment of the Ananda Mahidol Foundation, which supports education and research in Thailand. The foundation was established using the leftover funds from his personal possessions, and has since provided scholarships and grants to thousands of students and researchers in various fields. His love of music also led him to establish the first symphony orchestra in Thailand, which still exists today as the Thailand Philharmonic Orchestra. Ananda Mahidol's death is commemorated every year on June 9th as a national holiday in Thailand, known as "Ananda Mahidol Day". Despite the controversy surrounding his death, his legacy as a beloved monarch and advocate for education and democracy lives on in the hearts and minds of the Thai people.</p><p></p><p>
