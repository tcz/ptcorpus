was
a Thai
personality.


					
			
		He had
		three

						</p><p>Mahidol Adulyadej was also known as Prince Mahidol of Songkhla and was a member of the Thai royal family. He was the 69th child of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) and the father of two of Thailand's most beloved kings, King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) and King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII). He was also known for his contributions to the modernization of Thai medicine and played a key role in the establishment of medical education in Thailand. In 1918, he enrolled at the Harvard Medical School in the United States and later went on to study public health at the Johns Hopkins University. Upon his return to Thailand, he served as a professor at the Siriraj Hospital and played a crucial role in advancing the medical education system in the country. He passed away in 1929 due to a kidney infection at the age of 37, and his legacy continues to be celebrated in Thailand.</p><p>Furthermore, Mahidol Adulyadej was not only a pioneer in the field of medicine but also in the modernization of Thailand's administrative and legal systems. He was appointed as the director of the Public Health Ministry and later served as the Secretary of State for Education. Mahidol Adulyadej also actively supported the development of democracy in Thailand and was a member of the People's Party, which led Thailand's transition from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy in 1932. Due to his contributions to the country's development, he was posthumously awarded the title of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej Vikrom, which is the highest honor bestowed by the Thai monarchy. The Prince Mahidol Award, which recognizes outstanding achievements in medicine and public health, was established in his honor and is considered one of the most prestigious awards in its field.</p><p>Mahidol Adulyadej's dedication to modernizing medicine in Thailand went beyond his work at Siriraj Hospital. He also created scholarships to support young Thai students pursuing medical education abroad. His efforts helped establish the first medical school in Thailand at Chulalongkorn University and the modernization of healthcare in the country as a whole. Today, he is remembered as a visionary in medicine and a crucial figure in advancing Thailand's development. Additionally, both of his sons went on to continue his legacy, with King Ananda Mahidol advocating for education reform and King Bhumibol Adulyadej dedicating much of his reign to social and economic development throughout the country.</p><p></p><p>
