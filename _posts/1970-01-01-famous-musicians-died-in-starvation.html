(December 28, 1899		Geneva-October 7, 1943			Kotlas)

	
		otherwise known as Bohdan Eugène Junod, Bogdan Eugeniusz Junod, Eugene Bodo or King of Polish Actors

	
was
a Polish
film director, actor, screenwriter, singer, film producer and comedian.


					</p><p>He was born to a family of Polish actors who were touring Switzerland at the time. Bodo rose to fame in Polish cinema during the 1930s, where his talent for comedy and singing made him a popular figure. He is best known for his roles in the films Rapsodia Bałtyku (Baltic Rhapsody) and Pieśniarz Warszawy (Singer of Warsaw). </p><p>In addition to his acting career, Bodo was also a successful film director, though many of his films were lost during World War II. He was also an accomplished singer, recording numerous popular songs and operettas. </p><p>During the war, Bodo was imprisoned at Fort VII in Poznań, Poland before being sent to a Nazi concentration camp in Kotlas, Russia where he ultimately died. Despite his tragically short life, Bodo's legacy lives on in Polish cinema and theater, and he is still recognized as one of the greatest talents of his time.</p><p>Bodo's interest in entertainment was spawned from his family, where he spent most of his childhood traveling across Europe with a theater troupe led by his parents. His theatrical foray begun with appearances in minor roles in drama productions in various theaters in Krakow, Poland but his life changed when he got his first silent film role in the 1920s. He moved to Berlin in 1924 to expand his career, where he starred in several films, including Die Achtzehnjährigen (The Eighteen-Year-Olds). Bodo returned to Poland in the early 1930s, where he became a celebrated actor and director in the industry. On top of his acting career, he also directed and wrote several movies. Bodo's music career took off in 1930 when he sang "Nie Wolno mi" ("I'm Not Allowed to") for the movie "Przebudzenie" (Awakening). He went on to record several hit songs in his musical career, including "Mały biały pies" ("Small White Dog") and "Skądeś ty, skądś cichy" ("From Where You Are Quiet"). Bodo's comedic ability was unparalleled, and he was a master of improvisation, creating his own jokes on set.</p><p>Unfortunately, Bodo's blossoming career was cut short by the second world war. His confinement and subsequent death in a Nazi concentration camp dashed expectations of him and left a gap for his contemporaries to fill. However, his impressive legacy remains stamped in Polish entertainment, influencing the industry well into the present day. Bodo's contributions extend beyond his acting and musical abilities, and they also encompass his pioneering use of camera angles and his work steering Poland's theater toward modernization.</p><p>In addition to his work in film and theater, Bodo was also a skilled athlete, participating in fencing and boxing. He also had a passion for aviation, and obtained his pilot's license in the mid-1930s. Bodo's personal life was marred by tragedy, as his first wife committed suicide in 1929. He later married actress Irena Solska, who he worked with frequently in the theater. Bodo's death at the hands of the Nazis was a tremendous loss for Polish entertainment, and his legacy is still celebrated today. In a 2014 poll conducted by the Polish edition of Forbes, Bodo was voted the greatest Polish actor of all time. Meanwhile, his films have been restored and re-released in recent years, introducing new generations to his talent and influence.</p><p></p><p>

(September 21, 1952		Leiblfing-July 1, 1976			Klingenberg am Main)


was
a German
, .


					</p><p>woman who underwent Catholic exorcism rites during the year before her death. She was diagnosed with epileptic psychosis, and the priest Ernst Alt, who reported that he had witnessed paranormal activity during the exorcism, was later tried and convicted of negligent homicide. The case attracted media and public attention and inspired the 2005 film The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Michel is survived by her parents and three sisters, and her grave became a pilgrimage site for believers in demonic possession and exorcism.</p><p>Anneliese Michel was born into a devoutly Catholic family and attended a school run by nuns. She suffered a seizure at the age of 16 and was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. In the years that followed, despite medical treatment, Michel's condition worsened and she began experiencing hallucinations and hearing voices. She became convinced that she was possessed by demons and sought help from the Catholic Church.</p><p>After unsuccessful attempts to cure Michel with medical treatment and psychiatric care, the Church granted permission for exorcism rites to be performed. The exorcisms were carried out over a period of several months in 1975-76, and during this time Michel's health deteriorated rapidly. She stopped eating, became emaciated and weak, and finally died of starvation and dehydration.</p><p>The subsequent trial of the Catholic priest who conducted the exorcisms, along with Michel's parents, attracted widespread attention and raised questions about the role of the Church in cases of mental illness. Michel's story has since been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries. Despite the controversy surrounding the case, her family and many believers continue to see her as a martyr and a symbol of faith.</p><p>Anneliese Michel's case was highly controversial and sparked debates about the responsibility of religious institutions in mental illness cases. Many people believed that Michel's condition was rooted in mental illness and could have been treated with proper psychiatric care, while others argued that her case was a genuine instance of demonic possession. In the years following her death, the Church revised its guidelines for performing exorcisms and emphasized the importance of proper medical and psychiatric care in such cases.</p><p>Michel's story also sparked discussions about the criminal responsibility of the priest who oversaw her exorcisms. The court found the priest guilty of negligent homicide in Michel's death, but he was given a suspended sentence and only required to pay a small fine. Many people felt that the verdict was too lenient, while others believed that the entire case was a tragic example of religious fanaticism.</p><p>Despite the controversy, Michel's story lives on as a powerful symbol of faith, suffering, and the mysteries of the human mind. Her grave continues to be a site of pilgrimage for many people who believe in the power of exorcism and the possibility of supernatural intervention in human affairs.</p><p></p><p>
