was
a New Zealand
lawyer.


					</p><p>In addition to his law career, Walter Buller was an avid ornithologist and naturalist. He accumulated a vast collection of New Zealand bird specimens and wrote a seminal work, "A History of the Birds of New Zealand," which was published in 1873. Buller's contributions to the study of New Zealand's native birdlife were highly significant, and he became known as one of the country's foremost naturalists. His legacy is carried on in the Walter Buller Memorial Award for ornithological research, which was established after his death.</p><p>Buller was born into a prominent family of early settlers in New Zealand. He was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School and completed his legal studies in Wellington. After being admitted to the bar, Buller practiced law in Wanganui before moving to Wellington in 1863. In addition to his work as a lawyer, Buller served in the Legislative Council and was appointed to the Legislative Council of New Zealand in 1874. </p><p>Buller's interest in natural history began in his childhood, and he became especially fascinated with New Zealand's birdlife. His talent for drawing and painting birds enabled him to produce accurate illustrations of the species he encountered. In the 1860s and 1870s, Buller undertook several expeditions to remote parts of the country to study and collect bird specimens. </p><p>Buller's "A History of the Birds of New Zealand" was a comprehensive account of the country's avian fauna and included descriptions of each species' anatomy, habitat, and behavior. The book was illustrated with Buller's own drawings, and remains a landmark work in New Zealand ornithology. </p><p>Buller was also active in conservation efforts, campaigning for the protection of endangered bird species and the establishment of national parks. His contributions were recognized during his lifetime, as he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1902 for his scientific contributions.</p><p>Buller's impact on ornithology extended beyond his written works. He was a founding member and president of the Ornithological Society of New Zealand, which was established in 1939. The society's annual journal, "Notornis," is named after a flightless bird species that Buller was particularly interested in. Buller also helped establish the country's first bird sanctuary, which was located on Resolution Island in Fiordland. In addition to his naturalist pursuits, Buller was active in the Anglican Church and served as a lay reader. He also had a keen interest in archaeology and collected artifacts from the Maori culture. Buller's dedication to study and preservation of New Zealand's natural history paved the way for future generations of scientists and conservationists. Today, he is remembered as an important figure in the country's scientific and cultural heritage.</p><p></p><p>
