							Test was born and raised in Whitby, Ontario, Canada, and had a passion for wrestling from a young age. After training with several wrestling schools, he made his wrestling debut in 1997 with the International Wrestling Association, and quickly gained popularity with his impressive size and athleticism. He eventually signed with the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) in 1998, where he became a fan favorite and won several championships.</p><p>In addition to his wrestling career, Test also dabbled in acting, appearing in several films and television shows, including the movie "Ready to Rumble" and the TV series "Pacific Blue." However, his true passion remained wrestling, and he continued to perform and compete until his untimely death at age 33.</p><p>Test's death was a shock to the wrestling community, as he was still in his prime and had many years of wrestling ahead of him. It was later revealed that he had been suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated head trauma. Test's passing helped bring attention to the dangers of concussions and head injuries in sports, and the WWE has since implemented several safety measures to protect its wrestlers.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=690218" title="Wikipedia article about Test">Test on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/south-korean-actors-born-in-1962.html' title='South Korean actors born in 1962'><strong>South Korean actors born in 1962</strong> List of the top 16 South Korean actors who were born in 1962</a></li><li><a href='/bangladeshi-musicians-died-before-turning-20.html' title='Bangladeshi musicians died before turning 20'><strong>Bangladeshi musicians died before turning 20</strong> List of the top 34 Bangladeshi music stars who died before 20</a></li><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-cerebral-edema.html' title='American actors died in Cerebral edema'><strong>American actors died in Cerebral edema</strong> List of the top 3 American actors who died in Cerebral edema</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/argentine-actors-died-at-age-39.html' title='Argentine actors died at age 39'><strong>Argentine actors died at age 39</strong> List of the top 1 Argentine actors who died when they were 39</a></li><li><a href='/american-actresses-died-at-age-62.html' title='American actresses died at age 62'><strong>American actresses died at age 62</strong> List of the top 17 American actresses who died when they were 62</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-actresses-died-in-stroke.html' title='Canadian actresses died in Stroke'><strong>Canadian actresses died in Stroke</strong> List of the top 2 Canadian actresses who died in Stroke</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
