							Django Reinhardt is widely recognized as one of the most important and influential musicians of the 20th century, particularly in the development of jazz music. Born into a Romani family in Belgium, Reinhardt overcame a difficult childhood to become a masterful guitarist by his teens. His unique style incorporated elements of jazz, folk, and Romani music, and he was revered for his technical skill and lightning-fast improvisation. Along with the Hot Club of France Quintet, Reinhardt popularized the genre of Gypsy Jazz, which has gone on to inspire countless musicians around the world. Despite losing the use of two fingers in a fire, Reinhardt continued to perform with a modified playing style that only added to his legendary status. He died in 1953 at the age of 43, but his impact on music can still be heard today.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=9039" title="Wikipedia article about Django Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/filipino-actors-died-in-multiple-organ-dysfunction-syndrome.html' title='Filipino actors died in Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome'><strong>Filipino actors died in Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome</strong> List of the top 1 Filipino actors who died in Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome</a></li><li><a href='/indonesian-musicians-died-at-age-61.html' title='Indonesian musicians died at age 61'><strong>Indonesian musicians died at age 61</strong> List of the top 7 Indonesian music stars who died when they were 61</a></li><li><a href='/belgian-musicians-died-at-age-38.html' title='Belgian musicians died at age 38'><strong>Belgian musicians died at age 38</strong> List of the top 5 Belgian music stars who died when they were 38</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/russian-actors-died-at-age-47.html' title='Russian actors died at age 47'><strong>Russian actors died at age 47</strong> List of the top 1 Russian actors who died when they were 47</a></li><li><a href='/swedish-actors-died-in-1990.html' title='Swedish actors died in 1990'><strong>Swedish actors died in 1990</strong> List of the top 3 Swedish actors who died in 1990</a></li><li><a href='/french-actors-died-in-cerebral-hemorrhage.html' title='French actors died in Cerebral hemorrhage'><strong>French actors died in Cerebral hemorrhage</strong> List of the top 5 French actors who died in Cerebral hemorrhage</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
