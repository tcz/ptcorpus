(December 28, 1856		Staunton city-February 3, 1924			Washington, D.C.)

	
		a.k.a. Thomas Woodrow Wilson, Schoolmaster in Politics, The Phrasemaker, The Professor, Coiner of Weasel Words, The Schoolmaster or Wilson, Woodrow

	
was
an American
politician, lawyer, professor, political scientist and historian.


					
			
		He had
		three
		children,
		Margaret Woodrow Wilson, Eleanor Wilson McAdoo and Jessie Woodrow Wilson Sayre.

						</p><p>Wilson served as the 28th President of the United States from 1913-1921, and is remembered for his efforts during World War I and in establishing the League of Nations to promote peace and diplomacy between nations. He was a noted intellectual and was the author of several books, including "Congressional Government" and "The New Freedom". Wilson's presidency also saw the implementation of progressive reforms, including the establishment of the Federal Reserve System and the passing of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. He suffered a stroke in 1919 that left him partially paralyzed, and his health continued to deteriorate in the years following his presidency until his death in 1924.</p><p>Wilson was born in Virginia to a Presbyterian family, and he received his education at Princeton University and the University of Virginia School of Law. He went on to teach at various universities throughout his career, including Wesleyan University, Johns Hopkins University, and Princeton. As President, he implemented a number of progressive policies, including the introduction of an income tax and the establishment of the Federal Trade Commission. </p><p>However, his tenure was not without controversy. His handling of race relations was criticized, particularly his support for racial segregation in several government agencies. His decision to enter the United States into World War I was also met with opposition from many Americans, and he faced difficulties in his efforts to negotiate a lasting peace treaty with European leaders.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Wilson remains an important figure in American history and is remembered for his contributions to progressive policies, his efforts to promote global peace, and his role in leading the US through one of the most challenging periods of the 20th century.</p><p>Wilson was also a strong supporter of women's suffrage and pushed for the passage of the 19th Amendment. He spoke out in favor of women's right to vote and called for suffrage to be included in the Democratic Party's platform in 1916. He also appointed the first woman to a high-level government position, when he named Jeannette Rankin as the superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps. However, his stance on women's issues was not always universally popular and some suffragists criticized him for not doing enough to support their cause.</p><p>In addition to his political accomplishments, Wilson was also known for his personal life. He was married twice and was known to have had several romantic relationships outside of his marriages. His first wife, Ellen Axson Wilson, died during his presidency, and he subsequently married Edith Wilson, who played an active role in managing his affairs after his stroke. Wilson was also an avid golfer and enjoyed spending time on the links throughout his life.</p><p>Despite his achievements as President, Wilson's legacy has been somewhat tarnished by his views on race relations. He was a strong supporter of segregation and allowed racist policies to be implemented in several government agencies. He also refused to meet with civil rights leader, W.E.B. Du Bois, during his presidency. Today, his mixed legacy is often debated, with some praising his progressive policies and others criticizing his record on issues of race and civil rights.</p><p></p><p>

Despite this controversy, Nixon had many accomplishments during his time in office, such as establishing diplomatic relations with China and ending the Vietnam War. Before his presidency, Nixon served as Vice President under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. As a young man, he also served in the United States Navy during World War II. After leaving office, Nixon wrote several books and remained active in politics until his death in 1994.</p><p>Nixon had a challenging childhood, marked by his family's poverty and the early deaths of two of his brothers. However, he was a brilliant student and earned a scholarship to attend Whittier College. He then went on to Duke University Law School, where he graduated third in his class. Nixon practiced law for several years before being elected to Congress in 1946. </p><p>Nixon gained national attention as a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he pursued allegations of communist infiltration in the government and entertainment industry. He rose quickly through the political ranks, serving in the Senate and then as Vice President before being elected to the presidency in 1968. </p><p>During his presidency, Nixon worked to expand social programs and signed several landmark environmental laws. He also oversaw the Apollo 11 moon landing and implemented a policy of detente with the Soviet Union. However, his reputation was forever tarnished by the Watergate scandal, in which he and his administration were found to have engaged in illegal activities, including wiretapping and the burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters. </p><p>After resigning from the presidency, Nixon largely retreated from public life. He wrote several critically-acclaimed books, including his memoirs and a study of foreign policy, and traveled extensively around the world. Nixon also continued to be involved in American politics through his writing and speeches, and remained a controversial figure until his death in 1994.</p><p>Additionally, Nixon was a skilled debater and campaigned tirelessly for his political party. He was known for his aggressive, no-nonsense style and his ability to connect with everyday Americans. He was reelected in a landslide victory in 1972, winning 49 out of 50 states. However, the Watergate scandal soon overshadowed his accomplishments and led to his resignation, making him the only U.S. president to have ever resigned from office. Nixon's legacy remains mixed, with some praising his foreign policy achievements and others condemning his abuses of power. Despite this, he remains a significant figure in American political history and is regularly studied by scholars and political analysts.</p><p></p><p>

Following the success of "M," Lorre immigrated to the United States, where he quickly established himself as a character actor in Hollywood.</p><p>Despite his success in Hollywood, Lorre struggled with typecasting - he was often cast in the same creepy, sinister roles. He also struggled with drug addiction, which affected his personal and professional life. However, Lorre continued to act in films and television throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. He was in the midst of filming an episode of "The Alfred Hitchcock Hour" when he suffered a stroke and died on March 23, 1964, at the age of 59.</p><p>Lorre's legacy as an actor and icon continues to live on through his films and influence on popular culture. He is often referenced in contemporary media, and his distinctive voice and performances are still celebrated by film enthusiasts.</p><p>In addition to his acting career, Lorre was also a talented artist and had a lifelong passion for painting. He often utilized his artistic skills to design his own costumes for film roles. Lorre was also multilingual and could speak several languages fluently, including German, English, French, and Hungarian. </p><p>Despite being typecast in creepy roles, Lorre was also known for his sense of humor and his ability to improvise on set. He often played practical jokes on his co-stars and directors, which added to his reputation as a quirky and eccentric actor. </p><p>Lorre was married three times throughout his life, and had one child, Catharine, with his second wife, Celia Lovsky. Celia was also a well-known actress and appeared in several films alongside Lorre.</p><p>Overall, Peter Lorre was a talented actor and artist who made a significant impact on both German and American cinema. Despite personal struggles, he remains a beloved and iconic figure in the world of film.</p><p></p><p>
