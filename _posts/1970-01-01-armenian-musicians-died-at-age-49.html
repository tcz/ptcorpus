(January 6, 1897		Košice-March 12, 1946			Budapest)

	
		a.k.a. Ferenc Szalasi

	
was
an Armenian
politician and soldier.


					</p><p>Actually, Ferenc Szálasi was a Hungarian politician and soldier, not Armenian. He was the founder and leader of the Hungarian fascist movement, known as the Arrow Cross Party, which came to power and established a fascist government in Hungary during the final months of World War II. Szálasi aligned Hungary with Nazi Germany and collaborated with them in their war efforts. After the war, he was captured and tried for his war crimes, including the deportation and murder of thousands of Hungarian Jews. He was eventually found guilty and executed on March 12, 1946 in Budapest.</p><p>Szálasi was born in Košice, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in 1897. After serving in World War I, he became involved in politics and formed the Arrow Cross movement in 1935. The party was strongly antisemitic and espoused a radical right-wing ideology that called for the restoration of Hungary's pre-Treaty of Trianon borders and the establishment of a fascist state.</p><p>During the war, Szálasi and his Arrow Cross Party gained power with the support of Nazi Germany. His regime was notorious for its cruelty and brutality, with thousands of Jews, Romani people, and other minorities deported to concentration camps and murdered. Szálasi also ordered the execution of Hungarian citizens who opposed his government.</p><p>Following the defeat of Nazi Germany, Szálasi fled to Germany but was captured by American forces in Austria in May 1945. He was subsequently extradited to Hungary to stand trial and was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to death and executed in 1946.</p><p>Today, Szálasi is remembered as a symbol of Hungary's darkest period, and his regime is widely reviled for its role in the Holocaust and the persecution of minorities.</p><p>Additionally, Szálasi was known for his oratory skills and his ability to appeal to the lower classes. He often spoke of removing corrupt politicians and returning Hungary to greatness. However, his policies were disastrous for the country, and his regime caused immense suffering and destruction. After his execution, his party was outlawed, and Hungary underwent a period of post-war reconstruction and democratization. Nonetheless, Szálasi remains a controversial figure in Hungary, with some far-right groups continuing to venerate him as a hero.</p><p></p><p>
