The film was highly politicized and was used as a propaganda tool by the Suharto regime to justify the mass killings carried out during this period. Outside of his work in film, Njoo was also a successful businessman and the founder of several companies in the entertainment industry, including the Titan Group which produced a number of popular Indonesian films in the 1970s and 80s. Despite his success, Njoo was known for his strong criticisms of government policies and was frequently targeted by the authorities as a result. He passed away in 1985 at the age of 55, leaving behind a legacy as one of Indonesia's most prominent film producers and critics of government corruption.</p><p></p><p>
