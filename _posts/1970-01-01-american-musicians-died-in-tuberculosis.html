(October 22, 1854		Flushing-May 5, 1911			Philadelphia)

	
		a.k.a. James Bland

	
was
an American
songwriter and musician.


					</p><p>He was one of the most prolific African American songwriters of the late 19th century and is considered the "Father of Black American Music". Bland's songs were immensely popular in their day and were performed by many famous musicians, including Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, and Duke Ellington. Bland wrote over 700 songs during his lifetime, but is best known for his 1879 hit "Carry Me Back to Old Virginny", which became the official state song of Virginia in 1940. Despite his success as a songwriter, Bland struggled financially throughout his life and was forced to sell the rights to many of his songs to support himself. He died at the age of 56 in poverty, but his music continues to be celebrated and performed today.</p><p>Bland was born to a free family in Flushing, New York, and showed an early talent for music. He attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., where he honed his skills as a songwriter and performer. After graduating in 1873, he began touring the country, performing his own songs and collaborating with other musicians. </p><p>During his career, Bland faced racial discrimination and was often forced to perform in segregated venues. He wrote many songs that dealt with the experience of being black in America, including "Oh, Dem Golden Slippers" and "In the Morning". His music was a reflection of the times, including the Reconstruction Era after the Civil War and the rise of the Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation.</p><p>Despite his struggles, Bland left a lasting legacy in American music. Many of his songs have become standards in the American repertoire and have been covered by countless artists. Bland was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970 and his contributions to American music are still celebrated today.</p><p>Bland's music not only influenced his contemporaries but also the generations of black musicians that followed in his footsteps. His songs became the soundtrack to the Civil Rights Movement, with his message of hope and resilience inspiring activists in their struggle against racial inequality. In recognition of his contribution to American music, a plaque honoring Bland was installed in the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2019, nearly 110 years after his death.</p><p>Bland's life story is a testament to his determination and perseverance in the face of adversity. He overcame racial barriers and economic hardship to become one of the most important songwriters in American history. His music crossed racial and cultural boundaries, bringing people together through shared experiences and emotions. Today, Bland's legacy continues to inspire the next generation of musicians, ensuring that his contributions to American music will never be forgotten.</p><p></p><p>

(February 11, 2015		Richmond-March 2, 1861			New Orleans)


was
an American
singer.


					</p><p>He was also a stage actor and comedian, known particularly for his blackface performances. Dixon was born into an African American family in Richmond, Virginia and began his career as a singer and performer in circuses and minstrel shows. He achieved great success with his song "Zip Coon," a satirical tune that mocked the dialect and mannerisms of free African Americans.</p><p>Dixon was also an influential figure in the development of American popular music. Along with other blackface performers of the era, he introduced a number of songs that would become staples of American folk and pop music. Some of his most popular songs include "Coal Black Rose," "Old Dan Tucker," and "Jim Crow."</p><p>Despite his success, Dixon faced racism and discrimination throughout his life. He was often the target of violent attacks and was frequently denied access to hotels and other accommodations. Despite these challenges, he persevered and continued to perform until his death in 1861. Today, he is remembered as a pioneering figure in American music and entertainment, but also as a troubled and controversial figure in the history of race relations in the United States.</p><p>In addition to his performances, George Washington Dixon was also known for his writing. He published a newspaper called The Polyanthos, which featured his own poetry and commentary on current events. He was a supporter of abolition and used his newspaper to advocate for the end of slavery.</p><p>Dixon's legacy is complicated by his use of blackface, which has come to be widely recognized as a form of racist caricature. Many of his contemporaries and modern scholars have criticized his performances for perpetuating negative stereotypes of African Americans.</p><p>However, Dixon was also a complex figure who challenged some of the racial hierarchies of his time. He often performed alongside white actors and was one of the few African Americans to achieve national fame in the 19th century. His performances also offered a space for African Americans to showcase their talents and to subvert some of the stereotypes imposed upon them by white society.</p><p>Today, his music and performances remain part of the American cultural landscape, and his life and legacy continue to provide insights into the ways that race, performance, and identity intersect in American society.</p><p>Dixon was married three times and had several children throughout his life. He had a reputation as a womanizer and was known to drink heavily. Despite these flaws, he was also remembered as a generous and charitable individual who frequently donated to causes supporting the education and upliftment of African Americans. </p><p>In addition to his work as a performer and writer, Dixon was also involved in politics. He supported the Whig Party and was an early supporter of Abraham Lincoln. He even wrote a campaign song for Lincoln's 1860 presidential campaign.</p><p>Dixon's influence can be seen in the work of later performers, particularly in the field of vaudeville. His use of satire and his incorporation of popular music into his performances helped to pave the way for future artists such as Bert Williams and Eddie Cantor.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his use of blackface, Dixon remains an important figure in American popular culture. His life and legacy provide a window into the complexities of race, entertainment, and identity in the 19th century, and continue to shape our understanding of these issues today.</p><p></p><p>
