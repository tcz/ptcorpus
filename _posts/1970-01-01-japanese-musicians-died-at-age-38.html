was
a Japanese
writer, novelist and screenwriter.


					
			
		He had
		four
		children,
		Sonoko, Masaki, Yūko Tsushima and Haruko.

						</p><p>Dazai is considered to be one of the most important Japanese writers of the 20th century. He is known for his dark, introspective and often autobiographical works that explore themes of mental illness, suicide, and human relationships. Some of his most famous works include "No Longer Human," "The Setting Sun," and "Otogi Zoshi." </p><p>Throughout his life, Dazai struggled with addiction to alcohol and drugs, as well as mental illness. Despite this, he was highly productive, publishing numerous works of fiction and non-fiction throughout his career. He is also known for his work as a screenwriter, with several of his novels being adapted into films and TV dramas.</p><p>Dazai's legacy continues to inspire generations of Japanese writers and readers, and his works remain widely read and studied both in Japan and around the world.</p><p>Dazai was born Shūji Tsushima, and his birth name was changed to Shūji Tsushima by his father in 1933 in order to disassociate him from his brother's politically troubled organization. Dazai was deeply affected by the suicide of his mother when he was 15 years old, which influenced his writing later in life. He attended Hokkaido University but dropped out to pursue a full-time writing career. Throughout his life, Dazai suffered from depression and attempted suicide multiple times. He also had numerous extramarital affairs and struggled with a complicated love life, which is reflected in his works. Despite his personal struggles and controversies, Dazai's literary achievements have left an indelible mark on Japanese literature and continue to be celebrated today.</p><p>In addition to his literary contributions, Osamu Dazai was also known for his political beliefs and activism. He was a member of the Japanese Communist Party in the 1920s and early 1930s, and his writing often reflected his leftist views. However, he eventually became disillusioned with the party and distanced himself from its ideology.</p><p>During World War II, Dazai was conscripted into the Japanese military and served as a censor, editing letters from soldiers at the front to ensure they did not reveal sensitive information. This experience also impacted his writing, and he later wrote about the horrors of war and the effects it had on individuals.</p><p>Despite his struggles with addiction and mental illness, Dazai's literary career continued to thrive in the years leading up to his death. He was awarded the prestigious Akutagawa Prize in 1947 for his novel "A Shameful Life" (also known as "Ningen Shikkaku" or "No Longer Human"), which is now considered one of his most influential works.</p><p>Dazai's personal life has also been the subject of much interest and speculation, with some of his relationships and affairs becoming the inspiration for his fictional characters. His daughter, the renowned writer Yuko Tsushima, also wrote about their family's experiences and her complicated relationship with her father in her memoir "Portrait of My Mother."</p><p>Today, Dazai is remembered as a literary icon and a tragic figure, with his life and work continuing to fascinate readers and scholars around the world.</p><p>Dazai's death in 1948 was controversial and remains a topic of discussion today. Some speculate that it was a suicide, while others believe it was a staged accident. His lover at the time, Tomie Yamazaki, also died in the same incident. Dazai's death deeply affected his family, friends, and fans, many of whom were mourning the loss of one of Japan's most celebrated writers. In the years since his passing, Dazai's work has continued to be translated into multiple languages and adapted into various formats, including TV dramas, anime, and films. His legacy as a writer and cultural icon has remained strong, and his influence continues to be felt throughout Japanese literature and popular culture.</p><p></p><p>
