		a.k.a. Dr. John Wiliam Polidori or Dr. John William Polidori

	
was
an English
writer and physician.


					</p><p>Polidori is best known for his role as the personal physician and traveling companion of Lord Byron. During their travels in Switzerland in 1816, Polidori was part of a group that included Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Mary Shelley. It was during this time that Polidori wrote the short story "The Vampyre", which is regarded as one of the first works of modern vampire fiction. Despite its success, Polidori felt overshadowed by the popularity of the story and struggled to establish himself as a writer in his own right. In addition to his literary pursuits, he also held several appointments as a physician, including serving as a military surgeon during the Napoleonic Wars. In the years following his death, Polidori's contributions to literature have been recognized and celebrated, with his work influencing a generation of writers including Edgar Allan Poe and Bram Stoker.</p><p>Polidori was born in London to an Italian father and an English mother. His father, Gaetano Polidori, was a famous professor of Italian literature and a linguist who had come to England to teach Italian. Polidori studied at various educational institutions, including the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow, before eventually earning his medical degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1815.</p><p>After completing his medical studies, Polidori was hired as a personal physician to Lord Byron, who was one of the most famous and controversial writers of his time. Despite the prestige of the job, Polidori found working for Byron to be challenging and wrote about his difficulties in maintaining a professional relationship with his employer.</p><p>In addition to "The Vampyre," Polidori wrote several other literary works during his lifetime, including a play called "Remorse" and a collection of poetry titled "The Fall of the Angels." However, he struggled to achieve success as a writer and was often overshadowed by the achievements of his more famous contemporaries.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Polidori's literary contributions have had a lasting impact on the horror genre, and his work continues to be studied and celebrated by scholars and fans of Gothic literature alike.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of suicide.
