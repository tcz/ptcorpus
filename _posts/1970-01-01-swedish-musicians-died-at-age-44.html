(January 1, 1850-July 25, 1894)


was
a Swedish
personality.


					</p><p>He was primarily a sculptor known for his work in neoclassical style. He studied in Stockholm before moving to Paris to further hone his craft. While in Paris, he became a member of the Académie Julian and gained recognition for his sculptures of heroic figures and mythological beings. His most famous work is the statue of King Gustav II Adolph located in Gothenburg, Sweden. Hasselberg also created many public monuments and memorials throughout Sweden, including the well-known equestrian statue of King Karl XIV Johan in Norrköping. In addition to his sculpting, Hasselberg was also an avid naturalist and ornithologist, and wrote several works on the subject. Unfortunately, his life was cut short at the age of 44 by a heart attack.</p><p>Despite his relatively brief life, Per Hasselberg left behind an impressive legacy as one of Sweden's most renowned sculptors. His neoclassical style, characterized by its emphasis on naturalism and attention to detail, set him apart from his contemporaries and solidified his reputation as a master of the genre.</p><p>Hasselberg's interest in natural history and ornithology, which he pursued alongside his sculpting career, is evident in many of his works. For example, the equestrian statue of King Karl XIV Johan features a number of animal motifs, including horses, lions, and eagles, that illustrate Hasselberg's fascination with the natural world.</p><p>In addition to the many public monuments and memorials he created throughout Sweden, Hasselberg also produced a number of smaller, more intimate pieces that are highly regarded by art historians and collectors. These include busts of prominent figures, such as the author August Strindberg and the physicist Gustaf Retzius, as well as a number of religious sculptures that demonstrate his versatility as an artist.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Per Hasselberg's contributions to the world of sculpture continue to be celebrated today. His legacy lives on in the many works he created during his lifetime, as well as in the countless artists and scholars he inspired through his dedication and passion for the arts.</p><p>Hasselberg's work was not limited to traditional sculpting media; he also experimented with new materials such as cast iron and concrete, which were gaining popularity in the late 19th century. He collaborated with architects and engineers on numerous projects, including the ornate facade of the Stockholm Concert Hall and the decorative elements of the newly built Grand Hotel in Stockholm. Hasselberg was also known for his innovative use of lighting in his sculptures, using it to highlight specific features and create dramatic effects.</p><p>In addition to his artistic pursuits, Hasselberg was involved in social causes and was an active member of the Swedish environmental movement. He believed that art and nature were intertwined and expressed this philosophy through his work. Hasselberg was also involved in the establishment of the Gothenburg Art Museum, which now houses many of his sculptures and serves as a fitting tribute to his life and career.</p><p>Today, Hasselberg is regarded as one of the most important sculptors in Scandinavia, and his work continues to be studied and admired by art enthusiasts around the world. His contributions to the neoclassical style and his dedication to his craft and his ideals have left an indelible mark on the world of art and culture.</p><p></p><p>

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize several times himself, but was never awarded the prize. In his literary criticism, Levertin was known for his emphasis on aesthetics and his rejection of political and social messages in literature. He had a great influence on other Swedish writers of his time, including Hjalmar Söderberg and August Strindberg. Levertin's life was tragically cut short at the age of 44 by a stroke, but his legacy as a writer and critic has continued to inspire generations of Swedish literature scholars and enthusiasts.</p><p>Levertin was born in a small village in Sweden where his father served as a priest. As a child, Levertin showed a great interest in literature and began writing poetry at a young age. He studied at Uppsala University and later became a professor of literature there, where he taught some of the most prominent Swedish writers of the time. In addition to his scholarly work, Levertin was also a prolific writer of fiction and essays, and his literary output earned him widespread acclaim.</p><p>Levertin was known for his extravagant lifestyle and his love of the finer things in life.

(November 27, 1843		Hisingen-September 30, 1888			London)


was
a Swedish
sex worker.


					</p><p>She moved to England in the 1860s and became involved in the sex trade in London's East End. Stride was murdered and is believed to be the third victim of the infamous serial killer Jack the Ripper. Her death occurred during a series of killings that terrorized the Whitechapel area of London in 1888. Despite an extensive investigation, Jack the Ripper was never caught, and the murders remain one of the most famous unsolved crimes in history. Elizabeth Stride has been remembered as a victim of the brutal violence that afflicted women in the lower classes during that time period.</p><p>After her arrival in England, Stride married a Swedish carpenter, John Stride in 1869. However, the marriage did not last long, and they separated in 1875. Following the separation, Stride began living with Michael Kidney, who worked as a dock laborer. She worked as a domestic servant for a few years before returning to prostitution to make a living.</p><p>Stride was known to be outspoken and assertive, which made her stand out from other women in the area. She was also described as having a rough temper, which sometimes led to confrontations with clients. On the night of her murder, Stride had reportedly been seen arguing with a man shortly before her body was discovered. </p><p>Despite the many theories and speculations about Jack the Ripper's identity, the true identity of the killer remains unknown. The legend of Jack the Ripper and his gruesome murders continues to fascinate people all over the world, and Elizabeth Stride remains one of the victims whose death contributed to the chilling legacy of Jack the Ripper.</p><p>An interesting aspect of Elizabeth Stride's life is that she was an advocate for women's rights and spoke out against the injustices that women faced in society. In 1875, she joined the Swedish branch of the Women's Social and Political Union, a pioneering feminist organization that fought for women's suffrage and equality. Stride was known to attend meetings and participate in demonstrations, and her involvement in women's rights activism suggests that she was a woman ahead of her time. However, due to the societal norms of the time, her involvement in the sex trade often overshadowed her activism work. Today, Elizabeth Stride is remembered not just as a victim of a gruesome crime, but also as a woman who fought for the rights of women in society.</p><p></p><p>

		a.k.a. Johan Baner

	
was
a Swedish
personality.


					</p><p>He was a marshal and one of the most successful military commanders in Swedish history, leading his army to victory in several critical battles during the Thirty Years' War. Banér started his military career as a soldier in the Swedish army in Poland before rising through the ranks to become a colonel. He was later appointed as a field marshal, and his greatest accomplishments came during his campaigns in Germany. Banér was known for his strategic thinking, leadership qualities, and fierce combat skills. Despite his military success, he suffered from alcoholism, which ultimately contributed to his downfall. Banér died in Halberstadt, Germany, during a campaign against the Habsburgs.</p><p>Banér was born into a noble family and received a proper education before he entered into the military. During his time in the Swedish army in Poland, he quickly gained recognition, and his skills were noticed by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Banér's first major victory was in 1626, where he led the Swedish army against a Polish-Lithuanian force. In 1630, Banér was appointed field marshal and was sent to Germany to join the ongoing Thirty Years' War.</p><p>In Germany, Banér was instrumental in several victories for the Swedish army, including the battles of Frankfurt an der Oder and Breitenfeld. He was also appointed governor of Pomerania, a role he held until his death. Banér's conquests in Germany made him an iconic figure in Sweden and earned him recognition as one of the greatest military commanders in Swedish history.</p><p>However, Banér's reputation took a hit in 1634 when the Swedish army suffered a defeat at the Battle of Nördlingen. Banér was heavily criticized for his tactics, and his alcoholism was believed to have caused his incompetence. Despite attempts to regain his reputation, Banér never made a full recovery from this defeat. Banér's alcohol addiction also continued, and he became increasingly unreliable, eventually causing his downfall.</p><p>Johan Banér's legacy lives on as one of Sweden's most significant military leaders, who helped shape the outcome of European wars in the 17th century.</p><p>Banér was married twice; his first wife was Margareta Posse, who died in 1632, and his second wife was Märta Nilsdotter. He had four children with Margareta, two of whom died in infancy, and two with Märta. Banér was known for his lavish lifestyle and love for fine wines and women, which contributed to his reputation as an alcoholic.</p><p>Despite his personal struggles, Banér was highly respected by his soldiers and peers for his bravery and strategic thinking. He was also known to be fiercely loyal to his king and country, and his devotion to the Swedish Empire was unmatched. Banér's military campaigns expanded Sweden's territory significantly, and his legacy is still celebrated in Sweden today.</p><p>In addition to his military successes, Banér was also a prolific writer, and his memoirs provide valuable insights into the politics and military strategies of the time. His memoirs were published posthumously in 1692 and have since become an important historical document.</p><p>In honor of his achievements, several monuments have been erected in Sweden to commemorate Banér's contribution to Swedish military history.
