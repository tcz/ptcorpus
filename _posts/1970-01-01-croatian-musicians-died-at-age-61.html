(May 8, 1898		Krašić-February 10, 1960			Krašić)

	
		also known as Aloysius Viktor Stepinac

	
was
a Croatian
cardinal.


					</p><p>Stepinac was the Archbishop of Zagreb during World War II and played a prominent role in opposing the fascist Ustaše regime and their persecution of Jews, Serbs, and Roma. However, he was also criticized for his perceived support of the Ustaše's Croatian nationalist agenda. After the war, he was tried by the Yugoslav communist government for alleged collaboration with the Ustaše, and although he maintained his innocence, he was found guilty and sentenced to 16 years in prison. He spent five years in confinement before being released due to ill health. In 1998, he was beatified by the Catholic Church as a martyr for the faith.</p><p>Stepinac was born in the village of Krašić in what is now Croatia. He was ordained a priest in 1930 and became known for his pastoral work with the poor and marginalized. In 1934, he was appointed the Archbishop of Zagreb, a position he held until his arrest in 1946. </p><p>During World War II, Stepinac spoke out against the atrocities committed by the Ustaše regime, a puppet state of Nazi Germany. He condemned the killing of Jews, Serbs, and Roma, and worked to protect those who were being persecuted. However, his stance on Croatian nationalism was ambiguous, which led to some criticism. </p><p>After the war, Stepinac was arrested by the communist Yugoslav government and charged with collaborating with the Ustaše. His trial was widely criticized as a show trial, and there were allegations of torture and coercion used on witnesses. Despite his insistence on his innocence, he was found guilty and sentenced to 16 years in prison. </p><p>Stepinac's case became a cause célèbre for the Catholic Church and Croatian nationalists. He was seen as a symbol of resistance against communist oppression and a defender of the faith. In 1998, Pope John Paul II beatified him, recognizing Stepinac as a martyr for his witness to the faith. </p><p>Today, Stepinac remains a controversial figure in Croatia and the wider region. While some see him as a hero and a defender of justice, others criticize his perceived support of Croatian nationalism and his association with the Ustaše regime.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by thrombosis.

writer and novelist.


					</p><p>Throughout his lifetime, Desnica proved himself to be one of the most prolific Croatian writers of the 20th century, producing a plethora of novels, short stories, essays, and travelogues. One of his most famous works is undoubtedly the novel "Proljeća Ivana Galeba" (The Springs of Ivan Galeb), which tells the story of a young man's journey to self-discovery in the tumultuous period after World War I. </p><p>Desnica's body of work is characterized by its lyricism and pastoral motifs, but also by a deep sense of melancholy and nostalgia for a vanishing world. Desnica was also involved in politics and served as a member of parliament in the first post-World War II assembly of Yugoslavia.</p><p>Despite his popularity with readers and critics alike, Desnica was often at odds with the Communist government of Yugoslavia, which he saw as repressive and hypocritical. Nonetheless, Desnica's literary legacy endures to this day, with his works still beloved by generations of Croatian readers.</p><p>In addition to his literary pursuits, Vladan Desnica was also a translator, journalist, and editor. He translated works by Russian authors such as Anton Chekhov and Ivan Turgenev into Croatian, and was a regular contributor to cultural and literary journals. Desnica studied literature and philosophy at the University of Zagreb, where he also became involved in leftist political movements. He spent time in Paris in the 1930s, where he was exposed to new literary and artistic trends, and later traveled extensively throughout Europe and the Middle East. Desnica's experience of war and displacement, as well as his deep fascination with nature and the rural way of life, are recurring themes in his work. Despite his criticisms of the Communist regime, Desnica remained committed to the ideal of a just and equal society, and continued to champion the cause of social justice throughout his life.</p><p></p><p>
