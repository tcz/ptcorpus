		a.k.a. Ethel C Pedley

	
was
an Australian
writer and musician.


					</p><p>Despite her short life, Ethel Pedley made a significant impact in the Australian literary world with her popular children's book entitled "Dot and the Kangaroo," which was published in 1899, a year after her death. The book followed the adventures of a young girl named Dot who became lost in the Australian bush and was helped by a friendly kangaroo. "Dot and the Kangaroo" has since become a beloved and enduring Australian classic, and was even adapted into an animated film in 1977. Aside from her writing, Pedley was also an accomplished musician, having trained in Europe as a pianist before returning to Australia to pursue her writing career.</p><p>Pedley was born in Acton, near Sydney, Australia, and was the daughter of James Pedley, a lawyer, and his wife Mary Hincks. She grew up in a wealthy family and was educated at home by a governess. Pedley developed an interest in music at an early age and began taking piano lessons from a young age. She showed great promise as a musician and was sent to Europe to study under the renowned piano teacher, Theodor Kullak, in Berlin.</p><p>After completing her studies, Pedley returned to Australia and settled in Sydney. She became involved in the city's cultural scene and began writing children's stories for local newspapers and magazines. Her stories were well-received and she soon became a popular writer in her own right.</p><p>Pedley's most famous book, "Dot and the Kangaroo," was inspired by her love of the Australian bush and her fascination with the country's native wildlife. The book was an instant success, and its popularity led to Pedley being invited to read her stories at children's events across Australia.</p><p>Despite her success as a writer, Pedley's life was marred by tragedy. She was diagnosed with cancer at a young age and died in 1898, just a year before the publication of "Dot and the Kangaroo." Her legacy, however, lives on, and her book remains an important part of Australia's literary heritage.</p><p></p><p>
