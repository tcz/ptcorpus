Additionally, Kennedy was deeply committed to his family and was known for his close relationships with his siblings and children.

(September 13, 1899		Huși-November 30, 1938			Snagov)

	
		also known as Codreanu, Corneliu, Corneliu Codreanu, Corneliu Zelinski or Căpitanul

	
was
a Romanian
politician.


					</p><p>He was the founder and leader of the Iron Guard, an ultranationalist and antisemitic organization active in Romania in the 1930s. Codreanu's ideas were heavily influenced by his Orthodox Christian faith and his belief in the importance of a strong and pure Romania. During his lifetime, he was seen as a controversial figure, with some regarding him as a hero and others as a dangerous extremist. In November 1938, Codreanu was arrested and imprisoned by the Romanian government, and within days he was killed, allegedly during an attempted escape from prison. His death sparked outrage among his supporters, who saw him as a martyr for their cause. Despite his controversial legacy, Codreanu remains an important figure in Romanian politics and history.</p><p>Born into a middle-class family in Huși, Romania, Codreanu was educated in law and philosophy at the University of Iași. He was a member of various right-wing political groups before forming the Iron Guard in 1927. Under his leadership, the Iron Guard became known for its violent tactics and its opposition to the existing political establishment.</p><p>Codreanu's political platform was based on an extreme form of nationalism and anti-Semitism. He believed that Jews were a threat to Romania's national identity and called for their expulsion from the country. He also advocated for the establishment of a totalitarian state that would be controlled by a single leader, or Căpitanul.</p><p>Despite the controversial nature of his politics, Codreanu's popularity grew during the 1930s. The Iron Guard became a mass movement with tens of thousands of members, and in 1935, Codreanu was elected to the Romanian parliament.</p><p>Codreanu's political career was cut short when he was arrested and imprisoned in November 1938. He and several other Iron Guard leaders were allegedly killed while attempting to escape from prison, although the circumstances of their deaths remain unclear.</p><p>Codreanu's legacy has been a subject of debate in Romania. Some see him as a hero who fought for Romanian independence and purity, while others view him as a dangerous extremist who promoted fascist and anti-Semitic ideas. Regardless of one's opinion, it is clear that Codreanu played a significant role in shaping Romanian politics and history during the interwar period.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Codreanu's influence extended beyond Romania. His ideas and tactics were admired by various far-right movements throughout Europe, particularly by the Nazi Party in Germany. Codreanu himself had close ties with Nazi officials and was invited to various events in Germany, where he was seen as a fellow anti-Semitic and nationalist. He also wrote extensively about his ideas and beliefs, publishing several books and pamphlets that became influential texts for far-right groups around the world.</p><p>In addition to his political activities, Codreanu was also a prolific writer and poet. His literature was heavily influenced by his Orthodox Christian faith and his passion for Romanian nationalism. His most famous work, "For My Legionaries," became a manifesto for the Iron Guard and remains a widely read text among far-right circles.</p><p>Despite his its short-lived existence, the Iron Guard continues to be a controversial topic in Romanian politics. Some far-right political groups have tried to revive its legacy, although its extreme and violent tactics have made it a subject of concern for many in the country. Regardless, Codreanu remains a powerful symbol of far-right nationalism, and his legacy continues to be felt in Romania and beyond.</p><p>In addition to his political and literary activities, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu was also known for his physical strength and athleticism. He was an accomplished athlete, particularly in wrestling and weightlifting, and often used his physical prowess as a means of demonstrating his virility and leadership qualities. His dedication to physical fitness and disciplined living also influenced the Iron Guard's ethos, which emphasized personal sacrifice and self-discipline.</p><p>Despite his extreme political views, Codreanu was admired by some for his personal qualities, including his charisma, sincerity, and unwavering commitment to his cause. He was known for being a powerful and inspiring speaker, and his speeches often drew large crowds of supporters. His personal magnetism was one of the key factors in the Iron Guard's success in mobilizing a large and devoted base of followers.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Codreanu's legacy has endured in Romanian politics and culture. His ideas and tactics have continued to influence far-right movements in Romania and elsewhere, and his writings remain popular among certain segments of the population. However, his association with anti-Semitism and fascist politics has also made him a controversial figure, and his legacy remains a subject of debate and controversy in contemporary Romania.</p><p></p><p>

was
an Italian
film director, poet, novelist, actor, journalist, screenwriter, philosopher, linguist, playwright, painter, politician and writer.


					</p><p>Pasolini is best known for his controversial films such as "Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom" and "The Gospel According to St. Matthew". He was a prominent figure in the Italian neorealist movement and often explored themes of poverty, social injustice, and sexuality in his work. In his personal life, Pasolini was openly gay and frequently faced censorship and criticism for his depictions of homosexuality in his films and writing. He was tragically murdered in 1975 under mysterious circumstances that still remain unsolved. Despite his short life, Pasolini has had a lasting impact on Italian culture and is widely regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.</p><p>Pasolini began his career as a novelist and poet, publishing his first collection of poetry, "The Ashes of Gramsci", in 1957. He then turned his focus to the cinema and began directing films, starting with "Accattone" in 1961. His films often featured non-professional actors and focused on the lives of marginalized individuals. His work also drew on his own personal experiences, as he grew up in poverty in a small town in northern Italy.</p><p>In addition to his film work, Pasolini was a prolific writer and thinker. He wrote numerous essays and articles on politics, culture, and society. He was also involved in politics himself and was a member of the Italian Communist Party.</p><p>Pasolini's untimely death at the age of 53 sent shockwaves through the artistic community and sparked numerous conspiracy theories. While his death was officially ruled a murder, the case remains unsolved to this day.</p><p>Despite the controversy that surrounded his work and his personal life, Pasolini's influence on Italian culture cannot be overstated. His films and writing continue to be studied and discussed, and his legacy as a groundbreaking artist endures.</p><p>Pasolini's films were often criticized for their graphic and disturbing content. His 1962 film, "Mamma Roma," was banned in several countries for its depiction of prostitution and poverty. Pasolini's depictions of homosexuality also drew controversy, especially in his 1971 film, "The Decameron." Despite this, he remained committed to pushing boundaries and telling stories that were often overlooked by mainstream cinema.</p><p>In addition to his artistic pursuits, Pasolini was also active in politics, running for office as a member of the Italian Communist Party. His political beliefs influenced his work, as he often used his films and writing to criticize capitalism and call for social change.</p><p>Today, Pasolini is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in Italian cinema history. His films are studied and admired for their poetic style, social commentary, and innovative storytelling techniques. Despite his controversial legacy, Pasolini's impact on Italian culture and cinema endures.</p><p>Pasolini was deeply inspired by theology and philosophy, and his interest in these subjects influenced his work as a filmmaker and writer. He often explored spiritual themes in his films, such as in his 1968 film "Teorema," which examines the impact a mysterious visitor has on an affluent family. In addition, Pasolini had a love for the Italian language and was a talented linguist. He published several works on the history and evolution of the Italian language, including "The Language of the Third Reich" and "The Language of the Cinema." Pasolini's multi-faceted career and diverse interests continue to fascinate and inspire artists and scholars alike.</p><p></p><p>
