					</p><p>Saloth Chhay, better known by his revolutionary nickname Pol Pot, was a Cambodian communist revolutionary who served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) from 1963 until his death in 1998. As the de facto leader of Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, he oversaw a radical and violent social transformation that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.5 to 2 million people, mostly from execution, forced labour, and starvation. This period, known as the Cambodian genocide, has been widely regarded as one of the worst atrocities of the 20th century. After the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge regime by Vietnamese forces in 1979, Pol Pot fled to the Thai border region and continued to lead a resistance movement until his death in 1998.</p><p></p><p>
