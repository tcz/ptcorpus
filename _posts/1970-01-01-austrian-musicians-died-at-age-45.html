									</h1><p>Here are 8 famous musicians from Austria died at 45:</p><h2>Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow</h2><p><strong>Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow</strong>
(August 5, 1846		Vienna-October 22, 1891			Vienna)

	
		otherwise known as Dr. Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow

	
was
an Austrian
physician.


					</p><p>He was a notable figure in the field of neurology and is best known today for his research on cocaine addiction. Fleischl-Marxow was educated at the University of Vienna and began his medical career as a student of Carl von Rokitansky, the founder of modern pathological anatomy.</p><p>After completing his studies, he worked as a private lecturer and physician at the University of Vienna. In 1878, he was appointed professor of special pathology and therapy at the university. His research focused on the nervous system, and he was particularly interested in the effects of drugs on the body.</p><p>In 1884, Fleischl-Marxow's research on cocaine addiction was published in the journal Wiener klinische Wochenschrift. He had conducted experiments on dogs, administering them with increasing doses of cocaine until they became addicted to the drug. This research showed that cocaine had a stimulating effect on the nervous system, leading to addiction.</p><p>Fleischl-Marxow suffered from chronic pain throughout his life, and he became addicted to morphine. He died in Vienna in 1891, at the age of 45, due to complications from his addiction. Despite his personal struggles, Fleischl-Marxow's research on cocaine addiction was groundbreaking and paved the way for future research on the effects of drugs on the body.</p><p>Fleischl-Marxow was also known for his contributions to the understanding of nerve conduction and the measurement of electrical conduction velocities in nerves. He developed a technique called the "Fleischl's Method" that used a spring-loaded tambour to measure these velocities. This method became widely used in neurophysiology and was instrumental in advancing the field. </p><p>In addition to his scientific contributions, Fleischl-Marxow was a member of the Austrian parliament and was involved in politics. He was a vocal advocate for the education and rights of women and children. He also supported the establishment of a national health insurance program in Austria. </p><p>Although his life was cut short by his addiction, Fleischl-Marxow's legacy lives on through his scientific contributions and his advocacy for social and political causes. He is remembered as a pioneer in the field of neurology and a champion for marginalized groups in society.</p><p></p><p>

(April 21, 1661		Brno-May 2, 1706			Manila)


was
an Austrian
scientist and botanist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his extensive contributions to the study of Philippine flora, after he was sent to the Philippines by the Vienna Jesuit College in 1687. While in Manila, Kamel established a pharmacy and a botanical garden, where he grew a large number of plants, many of which were previously unknown to Europeans. He wrote extensively about the medicinal properties of plants, and was especially interested in orchids, which he sent to Europe to be studied further.</p><p>Aside from his work in botany, Kamel was also a skilled linguist, and was able to speak several Asian languages fluently. He provided valuable assistance in translating documents and communicating with locals during his time in the Philippines. </p><p>Today, Kamel is regarded as one of the pioneers of Philippine botany, and he is remembered in the scientific name of the Kamel's orchid (Phalaenopsis kamelii), which he first discovered and documented.</p><p>Kamel was born in Brno, which is now in the Czech Republic, to a German family. He joined the Jesuit order in 1679 and completed his studies in Vienna before being sent to the Philippines. During his time in Manila, Kamel worked closely with local healers and studied their traditional remedies, incorporating this knowledge into his own research. His botanical garden became a hub for scientific exchange, and Kamel corresponded with a number of European botanists, sharing specimens and information.</p><p>Kamel's work helped establish the Philippines as an important center for botanical research, and he is considered one of the most important early figures in the field of Philippine botany. He died in Manila at the age of 45, reportedly due to overwork and poor health. Despite his relatively short life, Kamel left behind a legacy that continues to be celebrated today. In addition to the orchid that bears his name, several other species of plants are named after him, including the shrub Kamel's bougainvillea (Bougainvillea kamelii).</p><p></p><p>

(January 24, 1880		Perchtoldsdorf-August 16, 1925			Buenos Aires)


was
an Austrian
scientist.


					</p><p>He is known for his contributions in the field of radioactivity and nuclear science. Merz studied physics and chemistry at the University of Vienna and later worked as an assistant to the famous physicist, Ludwig Boltzmann. He was the first to produce artificial radioactive isotopes by bombarding stable elements with alpha particles. In 1911, he discovered the radioactive element radium emanation and developed a method for its purification. Merz's work helped lay the groundwork for the future development of nuclear technology. Despite his contributions to science, Merz's career was cut short when he died at the young age of 45 from malaria while conducting research studies in Argentina.</p><p>Merz was also a pioneer in the use of X-rays for medical purposes. He developed a vacuum tube that was used in early X-ray machines and improved the accuracy of X-ray images. Merz also made significant contributions to the study of cosmic rays, discovering that they are charged particles on their way to Earth from space. In addition to his scientific work, Merz was an advocate for peace and disarmament. He helped organize the first international conference on the peaceful uses of atomic energy in 1924. His early death was a loss to the scientific community, and he is remembered for his important contributions to the study of radioactivity and nuclear science.</p><p></p><p>

(July 1, 1848		Prague-January 25, 1894			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
mathematician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on projective differential geometry, a field of mathematics that deals with geometric transformations and their properties. He is also credited with co-founding the Vienna Circle, a group of philosophers and scientists who met regularly to discuss logical positivism, a philosophical movement that emphasizes the importance of empirical evidence.</p><p>Weyr studied at the University of Vienna, where he earned his doctorate in 1873 with a thesis on optimal control theory. He later became a professor at the Technical University of Vienna, where he taught mathematics and physics. Weyr was also a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, where he served as president from 1890 to 1891.</p><p>In addition to his mathematical contributions, Weyr wrote several books and articles on philosophy and science. His work on logical positivism helped shape the movement, and his ideas on language and meaning influenced the development of the linguistic turn in philosophy. Despite his many accomplishments, Weyr died at the young age of 45, leaving behind a legacy of pioneering work in mathematics and philosophy.</p><p>Weyr had a keen interest in linguistics and was multilingual, speaking German, French, English, Italian, and Latin fluently. He believed that the study of language was essential to understanding the structures of human thought and was instrumental in the development of the theory of language games, a concept later popularized by philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. </p><p>Weyr's work on projective differential geometry resulted in the development of the concept of Weyr coordinates, which are used in the study of linear subspaces in projective geometry. He also made significant contributions to the study of isogonal trajectories, which are curves that intersect another set of curves at the same angle. </p><p>Weyr's legacy continues to influence the fields of mathematics and philosophy today. His work on logical positivism helped shape the movement and was instrumental in the development of modern scientific methodology. Additionally, his contributions to projective differential geometry established a foundation for further research and innovation in the field.</p><p></p><p>
