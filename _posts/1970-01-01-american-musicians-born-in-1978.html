The brand focuses on environmentally friendly materials and practices, with a portion of the proceeds going toward ocean conservation efforts. </p><p>Despite being widely recognized for his musical talent, Foreman has remained humble and grounded. He has attributed his success to not only his hard work, but also to the support of his family, bandmates, and fans.</p><p>Foreman was born and raised in Lake Arrowhead, California, where he first discovered his love for music at a young age. He began playing bass guitar in his early teens, and eventually formed a band with his brother, Jon.

Switchfoot's breakout album, "The Beautiful Letdown," was released in 2003 and propelled the band to mainstream success with hit singles such as "Meant to Live" and "Dare You to Move." Since then, the band has continued to release critically acclaimed albums and tour the world, while also maintaining their commitment to using their platform to make a positive impact in the world. Foreman's bass playing has been noted for its melodic and driving qualities, and has been cited as a key element of Switchfoot's sound. He often plays a Fender Precision Bass and has also used Warwick and Music Man basses.
