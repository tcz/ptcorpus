							Lionel Terray was one of the foremost alpinists of his generation, and his accomplishments in the mountains earned him a reputation as a legend in the climbing community. In addition to his feats as a mountaineer, Terray was also an accomplished author and actor. He wrote several books on mountaineering, including "Conquistadors of the Useless," which chronicled his expeditions in the Alps and the Himalayas. As an actor, he appeared in several French films, including "La Grande Vadrouille" and "The Black Rose." Despite his success in these pursuits, Terray is perhaps best remembered for his contributions to the development of mountaineering equipment and techniques. He was instrumental in the design of the "Terray Tent," which revolutionized high-altitude camping, and his approach to climbing inspired a generation of mountaineers. Terray's tragic death in a climbing accident in 1965 was a great loss to the mountaineering community, but his legacy lives on through his numerous contributions to the sport.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=1270051" title="Wikipedia article about Lionel Terray">Lionel Terray on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Tony D&#039;Amario</h2><p><strong>Tony D&#039;Amario</strong>
