(June 18, 1903		Saint-Maur-des-Fossés-December 12, 1923			Paris)


was
a French
novelist and writer.


					</p><p>Despite his short life, Radiguet wrote a number of influential works and is considered a significant figure of the literary movement known as the "Lost Generation". His most famous work is the novel "Le Diable au corps" ("The Devil in the Flesh"), which was published when he was just 17 years old and caused a scandal due to its explicit themes. Radiguet was also associated with prominent artists and writers of his time, including Jean Cocteau and Pablo Picasso. Even today, his writing continues to be celebrated for its striking style and exploration of taboo topics.</p><p>Radiguet was born to a middle-class family but his parents' divorce when he was four years old made his childhood difficult. He dropped out of school at the age of 14 and started working for a bookseller. In 1919, at the age of 16, he met the famous writer and artist, Jean Cocteau, who became his mentor and close friend. Cocteau recognized Radiguet's talent and helped him publish his first poems and stories in several magazines.</p><p>"The Devil in the Flesh" was published in 1923 and became an instant success, selling over 100,000 copies in a year. The novel was controversial due to its depiction of a young boy's passionate love affair with a married woman during World War I. Some critics condemned it as immoral, while others praised it for its honesty and boldness. Despite the controversy, the novel helped to establish Radiguet as a major new voice in French literature.</p><p>Sadly, Radiguet's life was cut short when he contracted typhus during a trip to Morocco with Cocteau. He died in Paris a few days after returning, at the age of 20. His early death cut short a promising career, but his impact on French literature cannot be denied. His work has inspired many writers, and his legacy lives on today.</p><p></p><p>

was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>Henri Gaudier-Brzeska was a sculptor, artist and writer who lived in France and England. He is known for his innovative and dynamic sculptures that draw influence from both cubism and futurism. In 1911, Gaudier-Brzeska moved to London, where he formed close relationships with the Vorticist group and other prominent artists of the day such as Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis. Despite his young age, Gaudier-Brzeska developed a reputation as a groundbreaking artist in his own right, creating works that challenged traditional notions of form and representation. Sadly, his promising career was cut short when he was killed in action during World War I at the age of just 23. Despite this, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska remains an important figure in the history of modern sculpture and continues to be celebrated for his fearless and innovative approach to the art form.</p><p>Gaudier-Brzeska's early life was marked by hardship, as his parents disapproved of his artistic aspirations and he was forced to work as an apprentice in a cabinet-making factory. However, he was determined to pursue his passion and soon left home to study sculpture in Paris. There he met Sophie Brzeska, an older woman who became his lover and muse, and with whom he took on the double-barrelled surname. The couple moved to London together, where they lived in poverty in a small flat in the East End.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced, Gaudier-Brzeska produced a remarkable body of work during his short life, including iconic pieces such as The Wrestlers and Red Stone Dancer. His sculptures were characterized by their powerful sense of movement and his use of unconventional materials such as wood, stone and plaster. He was also a talented writer, contributing articles and reviews to avant-garde publications such as Blast and The Egoist.</p><p>In addition to his artistic contributions, Gaudier-Brzeska's life and work are notable for their political and social dimensions. He was a committed anarchist and saw his art as a means of challenging established power structures and conventions. He was also deeply influenced by non-Western art, particularly that of ancient Egyptian and African cultures, and incorporated these influences into his own work.</p><p>Today, Gaudier-Brzeska's work is held in major collections around the world, including the Tate Gallery in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His legacy continues to inspire and influence generations of artists, and his story serves as a reminder of the transformative power of creative and intellectual courage.</p><p></p><p>

However, she was determined to follow her passion for art and became a talented artist in her own right. She studied at the École des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and exhibited her work at the Salon d'Automne in 1918.</p><p>Hébuterne's artistic style was heavily influenced by Modigliani and his circle of avant-garde artists. She often depicted herself and her lover in her artwork, creating intimate and tender portraits that captured the intensity of their relationship.</p><p>Despite the challenges they faced, Hébuterne remained devoted to Modigliani until the end of his life. She was devastated by his death and chose to join him in death rather than face the world without him.</p><p>Today, Hébuterne's artwork is recognized for its unique blend of modernism and classicism, and her tragic story continues to captivate art lovers and historians around the world.</p><p></p><p>
