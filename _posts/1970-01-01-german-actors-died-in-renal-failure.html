		a.k.a. Konstantin Kaiser

	
was
a German
film director, actor and film producer.



						</p><p>He began his career in the German film industry in the 1940s, but was forced to flee to the United States in 1948 due to his Jewish background and his opposition to the Nazi regime. In the US, he continued his filmmaking career and also became involved in the theater, working as a director and producer on Broadway. Kalser was known for his work on films such as "The Young Lions" (1958) and "The Girl Who Knew Too Much" (1963), as well as for his collaborations with actors such as Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor. In addition to his work in film and theater, Kalser was also an important figure in the German-Jewish community, frequently speaking out on issues such as anti-Semitism and the need for cultural exchange between Germany and Israel. He passed away in New York in 1994 at the age of 73.</p><p>During his early years in the US, Kalser was active in the anti-fascist movement and worked as a lecturer and organizer for various anti-Nazi and anti-racist groups. He also became involved in political activism, advocating for civil rights and social justice causes. In 1969, Kalser co-founded the American Jewish Theater in New York, which became one of the most respected Jewish theaters in the country. He continued to direct and produce both on Broadway and Off-Broadway throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and was praised for his innovative and dynamic approach to theater.</p><p>Kalser was married to the Austrian actress and writer Ruth von Zerboni, with whom he had a son. His legacy as a filmmaker and theater director continues to be remembered and celebrated today, and his contributions to the German-Jewish community and the fight against fascism and racism serve as a reminder of the importance of speaking out against injustice.</p><p>Kalser's passion for filmmaking began at a young age and he worked as an apprentice at UFA Studios in Berlin while still in his teens. He later served in the German army during World War II, but was captured by American forces and held as a prisoner of war for several years. After his release, Kalser returned to the film industry and began working as a director and producer for various studios in Germany.</p><p>In the early years of his career, Kalser was best known for his work in genre films such as war dramas and crime thrillers. However, he later began to explore more experimental and artistic styles of filmmaking, and his work on films such as "The Girl Who Knew Too Much" reflected this shift in his approach. Kalser was also known for his collaborations with actors such as Montgomery Clift, who starred in his film "The Young Lions."</p><p>Throughout his life, Kalser remained committed to the fight against fascism and racism. He was awarded numerous honors for his contributions to the German-Jewish community, including the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit from the Federal Republic of Germany in 1984. Kalser's son, Peter de Koning, also went on to become a successful theater director, continuing his father's legacy in the world of entertainment.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-organ-failure.html' title='Famous actors died in Organ Failure'><strong>Famous actors died in Organ Failure</strong> List of the top 2 Famous actors who died in Organ Failure</a></li><li><a href='/russian-actors-died-in-2003.html' title='Russian actors died in 2003'><strong>Russian actors died in 2003</strong> List of the top 4 Russian actors who died in 2003</a></li><li><a href='/german-actors-died-in-1986.html' title='German actors died in 1986'><strong>German actors died in 1986</strong> List of the top 8 German actors who died in 1986</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/south-korean-actresses-died-in-1993.html' title='South Korean actresses died in 1993'><strong>South Korean actresses died in 1993</strong> List of the top 1 South Korean actresses who died in 1993</a></li><li><a href='/british-actresses-died-in-2010.html' title='British actresses died in 2010'><strong>British actresses died in 2010</strong> List of the top 15 British actresses who died in 2010</a></li><li><a href='/hungarian-musicians-died-at-age-66.html' title='Hungarian musicians died at age 66'><strong>Hungarian musicians died at age 66</strong> List of the top 20 Hungarian music stars who died when they were 66</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
