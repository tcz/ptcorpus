He received his education in the Kurdish language, and at the age of 18, he started getting involved in Kurdish politics. He became the leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party in 1946 and led several unsuccessful uprisings against the Iraqi government.

After his death on his 73rd birthday, his son Masoud Barzani succeeded him as the leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party.</p><p>Ahmed Barzani's fight for Kurdish autonomy in Iraq was heavily influenced by his experiences as a young man. His father was killed by the Ottoman Governor of Mosul when Ahmed was just ten years old, and he grew up in a family that valued Kurdish culture and language. This led him to become a passionate activist for Kurdish independence, believing that the Kurdish people had the right to their own self-determination.</p><p>Ahmed Barzani's political career was marked by his persistence in the face of adversity. He faced many setbacks in his attempts to gain Kurdish autonomy, including imprisonment and exile, but he never gave up his fight. Even after returning to Iraq in 1961, he continued to lead the Kurdish Democratic Party until his death in 1969.</p><p>Ahmed Barzani's legacy continues to be felt in Kurdish politics to this day. His son, Masoud Barzani, served as President of the Kurdistan Regional Government from 2005 to 2017, and the Kurdish Democratic Party remains a major political force in Iraqi Kurdistan. Ahmed Barzani's unwavering dedication to Kurdish independence and his role in the formation of the Kurdistan Regional Government have cemented his place in Kurdish history as a champion of the Kurdish people.</p><p>In addition to his political activities, Ahmed Barzani was also a prolific writer and poet. He wrote many poems and articles in the Kurdish language, advocating for Kurdish rights and culture. He also wrote a memoir, "Kurdistan Rises," which recounts his experiences in the Kurdish resistance movement. Ahmed Barzani's contributions to Kurdish literature have earned him a place as one of the most important figures in Kurdish cultural history. His legacy continues to inspire Kurdish writers, activists, and politicians to this day.  Additionally, Ahmed Barzani's efforts to establish an autonomous Kurdistan in northern Iraq were part of a larger movement for Kurdish autonomy in the region. His work laid the foundation for the Kurdish struggle in Iraq and inspired later generations of Kurdish activists to continue the fight for Kurdish rights and independence.</p><p></p><p>
