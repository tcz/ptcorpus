(April 17, 1895		Saint Petersburg-August 22, 1970			Saint Petersburg)

	
		also known as V. I͡A. Propp

	
was
a Russian
literary critic.


					</p><p>He is best known for his contribution to the field of folklore studies, particularly his book "Morphology of the Folktale." This work analyzed the structure and function of traditional Russian fairy tales and developed a framework of 31 narrative functions which are common to different narratives. Propp's theories of structuralism and narratology have had a significant impact on fields such as anthropology, linguistics, and cultural studies. In addition to his work on folklore, Propp was also a scholar of Russian literature and culture, and he wrote several books on the topic. Despite his immense contribution to academia, Propp struggled to gain official recognition during his lifetime due to political censorship in the Soviet Union.</p><p>Propp was born into a privileged family and grew up surrounded by literature and culture. He studied Russian literature and folklore at the University of St. Petersburg and later became a professor at the same university. In addition to "Morphology of the Folktale," Propp's other notable works include "Russian Agrarian Literature" and "The Russian Folk Tale." He also published numerous articles on literary theory and cultural history.</p><p>During the Soviet era, Propp faced challenges due to his scholarly pursuits. His works were censored and he was briefly arrested on suspicion of anti-Soviet activities. Despite this, he continued to work and teach, and many of his ideas gained popularity in the academic community. After his death, his works began to receive wider recognition and his theories of narrative structure and function continue to be influential in academic circles today.</p><p>Propp's groundbreaking theory of the structure of fairy tales was based on the idea that folk tales have a certain underlying structure that can be analyzed across cultures. He identified 31 "functions" or plot elements that make up the basic structure of a fairy tale, such as the villainy of the villain, the departure of the hero, and the defeat of the villain. These functions can be rearranged and combined in different ways to create a wide variety of stories. His analysis of fairy tales has been influential not only in folklore studies, but also in other disciplines such as linguistics, psychology, and media studies.</p><p>Aside from his academic work, Propp also played an active role in the preservation and promotion of Russian culture. He was a member of the Russian Ethnographic Society and helped to establish the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography in St. Petersburg. He was also involved in translating and publishing works of traditional Russian literature, including fairy tales and folk songs.</p><p>Propp's legacy continues to influence scholars in a variety of disciplines. His approach to analyzing narrative structure has been applied to everything from Hollywood movies to political speeches, and his work has helped to shed light on the ways in which stories and storytelling shape our understanding of the world.</p><p></p><p>
