actor.



						</p><p>She was born in Taranto, Southern Italy, and raised in Naples where she began her career as a stage actress. In 1915, she moved to Rome and appeared in a number of films, becoming one of the most popular actresses of the silent era in Italy. She often played the femme fatale or the seductress in melodramas and adventure epics.</p><p>In the 1920s, Almirante-Manzini also became a renowned singer and interpreter of popular songs, recording many discs for Columbia Records. She continued to appear in films through the 1930s, but her star began to fade with the arrival of sound cinema. In 1937, she and her husband, the actor and director Amleto Novelli, fled Italy due to the fascist regime's persecution of their liberal views and activism. They settled in Brazil, where they continued to work in theater and film until their deaths.</p><p>Despite her prolific career and popularity, Almirante-Manzini's legacy has been overshadowed by her association with Mussolini's regime, as she made several propaganda films during World War II. Nonetheless, she remains an important figure in the history of Italian cinema and culture.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/finnish-actors-died-in-suicide.html' title='Finnish actors died in Suicide'><strong>Finnish actors died in Suicide</strong> List of the top 3 Finnish actors who died in Suicide</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-2007.html' title='Famous actors died in 2007'><strong>Famous actors died in 2007</strong> List of the top 50 Famous actors who died in 2007</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-actresses-died-in-breast-cancer.html' title='Austrian actresses died in Breast cancer'><strong>Austrian actresses died in Breast cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Austrian actresses who died in Breast cancer</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/argentine-musicians-died-at-age-65.html' title='Argentine musicians died at age 65'><strong>Argentine musicians died at age 65</strong> List of the top 14 Argentine music stars who died when they were 65</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-lobar-pneumonia.html' title='Famous musicians died in Lobar pneumonia'><strong>Famous musicians died in Lobar pneumonia</strong> List of the top 2 Famous music stars who died in Lobar pneumonia</a></li><li><a href='/belgian-actresses-died-in-1977.html' title='Belgian actresses died in 1977'><strong>Belgian actresses died in 1977</strong> List of the top 1 Belgian actresses who died in 1977</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
