was
an Italian
actor.



						</p><p>She was born in Taranto, Southern Italy, and raised in Naples where she began her career as a stage actress. In 1915, she moved to Rome and appeared in a number of films, becoming one of the most popular actresses of the silent era in Italy. She often played the femme fatale or the seductress in melodramas and adventure epics.</p><p>In the 1920s, Almirante-Manzini also became a renowned singer and interpreter of popular songs, recording many discs for Columbia Records. She continued to appear in films through the 1930s, but her star began to fade with the arrival of sound cinema. In 1937, she and her husband, the actor and director Amleto Novelli, fled Italy due to the fascist regime's persecution of their liberal views and activism. They settled in Brazil, where they continued to work in theater and film until their deaths.</p><p>Despite her prolific career and popularity, Almirante-Manzini's legacy has been overshadowed by her association with Mussolini's regime, as she made several propaganda films during World War II. Nonetheless, she remains an important figure in the history of Italian cinema and culture.</p><p>During her peak years in the Italian film industry from 1915 to the late 1920s, Italia Almirante-Manzini appeared in over 60 films, collaborating with some of the most prominent directors of the time, including Augusto Genina and Ubaldo Pittei. Her notable films include "Il Fuoco" (1916), "La Moglie di Claudio" (1918), and "La Donna Nuda" (1922). In addition to her acting and singing career, Almirante-Manzini was also a feminist activist and a member of the Italian Socialist Party. She participated in political rallies and demonstrations, advocating for women's rights and social justice. Her involvement in left-wing politics and her opposition to fascism ultimately led to her exile from Italy. In Brazil, she continued to pursue her artistic and political interests, performing in plays and films that reflected her progressive views. She died in São Paulo in 1941, at the age of 51, due to complications from pneumonia. Despite her complex legacy, Italia Almirante-Manzini remains an iconic figure in Italian cultural history, remembered for her fearless spirit and her contributions to the arts and social justice.</p><p>Moreover, Italia Almirante-Manzini was not only a talented actress but also a director and screenwriter. In 1921, she wrote and directed the film "La contessa di Parma" (The Countess of Parma), making her one of the first female directors in Italian cinema. She continued to write scripts for other directors throughout her career. She was also a pioneer in the use of special effects and animation in Italian cinema, experimenting with these techniques in films such as "La Diva" (1917) and "Maciste all'inferno" (1925).</p><p>Almirante-Manzini was known for her progressive views on women's rights, and her work often reflected her feminist beliefs. She portrayed strong, independent women on screen, challenging the traditional gender roles of Italian society at the time. Off-screen, she was a vocal advocate for women's suffrage and worked to promote women's education and professional opportunities. She also supported workers' rights and was involved in the anti-fascist resistance movement in Italy.</p><p>Although her work during the fascist era has overshadowed her earlier contributions to Italian cinema, Almirante-Manzini's legacy as a pioneering female filmmaker and progressive activist is being rediscovered and celebrated today. In recent years, her films have been restored and screened at film festivals around the world, and she has been the subject of several retrospectives and exhibitions.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/finnish-actors-died-in-suicide.html' title='Finnish actors died in Suicide'><strong>Finnish actors died in Suicide</strong> List of the top 3 Finnish actors who died in Suicide</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-2007.html' title='Famous actors died in 2007'><strong>Famous actors died in 2007</strong> List of the top 50 Famous actors who died in 2007</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-actresses-died-in-breast-cancer.html' title='Austrian actresses died in Breast cancer'><strong>Austrian actresses died in Breast cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Austrian actresses who died in Breast cancer</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/argentine-musicians-died-at-age-65.html' title='Argentine musicians died at age 65'><strong>Argentine musicians died at age 65</strong> List of the top 14 Argentine music stars who died when they were 65</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-lobar-pneumonia.html' title='Famous musicians died in Lobar pneumonia'><strong>Famous musicians died in Lobar pneumonia</strong> List of the top 2 Famous music stars who died in Lobar pneumonia</a></li><li><a href='/belgian-actresses-died-in-1977.html' title='Belgian actresses died in 1977'><strong>Belgian actresses died in 1977</strong> List of the top 1 Belgian actresses who died in 1977</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
