He was particularly involved in negotiations related to disarmament and international security, and played a key role in the development of the League of Nations' disarmament treaties.</p><p>During World War II, Roll was serving as the Norwegian ambassador to the Soviet Union when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. He worked tirelessly to maintain diplomatic channels between the Soviet Union and Norway, and also played a key role in rescuing Norwegian soldiers who had been imprisoned in the Soviet Union. In 1943, he was appointed as the Norwegian ambassador to the United States, where he continued to work towards strengthening the ties between the two countries.</p><p>Sadly, Sigurd Roll died in a plane crash in 1944 while on a diplomatic mission to Oslo. He was posthumously awarded the Order of St. Olav for his outstanding service to Norway.</p><p>Roll's diplomatic efforts during World War II were not limited to just the Soviet Union and United States. He also played an important role in negotiations with Germany during the occupation of Norway. In 1943, he was part of a secret mission to Stockholm to negotiate a ceasefire between the Norwegian resistance and German forces. Although the negotiations ultimately failed, Roll's efforts were recognized for their importance in attempting to bring an end to the conflict in Norway.</p><p>Aside from his diplomatic career, Sigurd Roll was also an accomplished author and historian. He published numerous books and articles on topics ranging from Nordic history to disarmament and diplomacy. His most notable work, "The Viking Age: 800-1050," was published in 1933 and has since become a classic in the field of Viking studies.</p><p>Roll's contributions to Norwegian diplomacy and international relations have been widely recognized. In addition to the posthumous award of the Order of St. Olav, his name adorns a street in Oslo, and he is remembered as one of Norway's greatest diplomats.</p><p>Roll was also a key figure in the negotiations that led to the signing of the Anglo-Norwegian Fisheries Agreement in 1930. This treaty granted Norway control over its own fisheries, which had previously been controlled by the British. The agreement paved the way for greater Norwegian independence in the years leading up to World War II.Roll's dedication to his work was legendary, with many of his colleagues describing him as tireless and devoted. His death was a great loss to Norway and to the diplomatic community, and he is remembered today as a true champion of diplomacy and international cooperation.</p><p>Roll's legacy continues to inspire diplomats and political leaders around the world. His commitment to diplomacy and international cooperation is a model for future generations, and his contributions to Norwegian history and culture continue to be celebrated. Roll's family has also been honored for their contributions to Norwegian society. His daughter, Kari Roll, served as the Minister of Culture for Norway in the 1980s, and his grandson, Lars Saabye Christensen, is a renowned Norwegian author and poet.
