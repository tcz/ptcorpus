(June 18, 1949		Warsaw-April 10, 2010			2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash site)

	
		also known as Lech Kaczynski or Lech Aleksander Kaczynski

	
was
a Polish
lawyer and politician.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Marta Kaczyńska.

						</p><p>Lech Kaczyński was a member of the Solidarity movement in the 1980s and rose to prominence as the Mayor of Warsaw in the 2000s. He served as the President of Poland from 2005 until his death in 2010. During his time in office, Kaczyński was known for his conservative and nationalist policies. He was also a strong advocate for the recognition of the Katyn Massacre as an act of genocide against the Polish people. Kaczyński's death, along with 95 other Polish officials, military officers, and civilian leaders, was a tragedy that deeply impacted the nation. His legacy remains a controversial topic in Polish politics, with some viewing him as a patriot and defender of traditional values, and others criticizing his polarizing rhetoric and policies.</p><p>Lech Kaczyński was born in Warsaw, Poland and had a twin brother named Jarosław Kaczyński, who also had a prominent political career. Lech Kaczyński studied law at the University of Warsaw and later became a professor of law at the same institution. In the 1980s, he became an active member of the Solidarity movement, which played a critical role in overthrowing the Communist government in Poland. </p><p>In addition to his political career, Kaczyński was also a noted historian and author. He wrote several books on legal and historical subjects, including "The Polish-Jewish Relations During the Second World War" and "The Katyn Crime - A State Secret." He was also a co-founder of the right-wing Law and Justice party (PiS), which became one of the most influential political parties in Poland during the 2000s.</p><p>During his presidency, Kaczyński was involved in several international affairs, including Poland's participation in the Iraq War and its relations with neighboring countries such as Russia and Ukraine. He was widely respected for his commitment to democracy and human rights, although his nationalist rhetoric and policies often drew criticism from foreign leaders and human rights organizations. </p><p>The 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash, which killed Kaczyński and 95 others, remains one of the most tragic incidents in recent Polish history. The crash occurred as the plane was attempting to land in Smolensk, Russia, and was en route to a commemoration event for the victims of Katyn massacre. The cause of the crash is still debated, with some critics alleging foul play or Russian involvement. Kaczyński's death was mourned by many in Poland, who saw him as a symbol of patriotism and national pride.</p><p>As President of Poland, Lech Kaczyński prioritized Poland's national interests and sovereignty. He was a strong advocate for NATO and the European Union, but also took a firm stance on issues such as immigration and LGBTQ rights. Kaczyński was a devout Catholic and opposed abortion and same-sex marriage, which made him unpopular among liberal and progressive groups in Poland. He was also criticized for his controversial remarks about minorities, including the LGBTQ community and Muslim immigrants, which many saw as discriminatory and divisive. Despite this, he remained a respected figure among his supporters, who praised his dedication to upholding traditional values and protecting Poland's national identity. </p><p>Kaczyński was survived by his wife, Maria Kaczyńska, who also died in the Tu-154 crash, and his daughter Marta Kaczyńska. His death was widely mourned in Poland, with thousands of people attending his funeral and paying their respects. In the years since his passing, his legacy has remained a contentious issue in Polish politics, with some hailing him as a hero and others criticizing his policies and rhetoric. Regardless of one's views, however, Kaczyński's impact on Polish history and politics is undeniable.</p><p></p><p>

(May 2, 1437		San Gimignano-November 1, 1497			Kraków)


was
a Polish
writer.


					</p><p>He is also known by the Latinized version of his name, Philippus Callimachus. Buonaccorsi moved to Kraków, Poland in 1475 and became a professor of poetry at the city's university. He is best known for his epic poem "Alexander," which was a retelling of the life and conquests of Alexander the Great. In addition to his work as a poet, Buonaccorsi was a scholar of classical literature and a translator, notably translating parts of Virgil's "Aeneid" into Polish. He was an influential figure in the cultural life of Renaissance-era Poland and is considered one of the most important literary figures of the Polish Renaissance.</p><p>Buonaccorsi was born in San Gimignano, a town in Italy's Tuscany region, and received his education in Florence. He was a humanist who believed that classical texts could provide valuable lessons for contemporary society. Buonaccorsi's interest in Alexander the Great was a product of this humanist outlook, as he saw the story of Alexander as a reflection of the virtues and vices of Renaissance-era rulers.</p><p>In addition to his literary work, Buonaccorsi played an active role in the political and social life of Kraków. He was a member of the royal court and had close ties to the Polish king, Casimir IV Jagiellon. Buonaccorsi also worked to promote humanist ideas throughout Poland and was involved in the founding of several humanist societies. His efforts helped to establish Kraków as a center of Renaissance culture in Central Europe.</p><p>Buonaccorsi's legacy as a writer and cultural figure has endured in Poland and beyond. His work inspired other Renaissance-era Polish writers, and his translations of Virgil helped to introduce classical literature to a wider audience. Buonaccorsi's epic poem "Alexander" remains a classic of Polish literature, and his contribution to the development of humanism in Poland has been widely recognized by scholars.</p><p>Another notable aspect of Filippo Buonaccorsi's life is that he was a dedicated advocate of women's education. He believed that women deserved to receive the same education as men and encouraged the establishment of schools for girls. Buonaccorsi also wrote several works in support of women's education, including a dialogue called "The Debate on the Education of Women." This was a progressive stance for the time, and his writings on the topic contributed to the advancement of women's education in Poland.</p><p>Buonaccorsi was a prolific writer, with his works encompassing a wide range of genres, including epic poetry, lyric poetry, essays, and translations. His works were written in Latin, Italian, and Polish, and some were published posthumously. In addition to "Alexander," his other notable works include "Rusticus," a pastoral poem, and "Carmina," a collection of his poetry.</p><p>Despite his numerous accomplishments, Buonaccorsi's life was not without controversy. He was accused of heresy at one point due to his association with a radical religious group, and his political views sometimes put him at odds with the ruling classes. However, even in his final days, Buonaccorsi remained committed to his beliefs, and his contributions to Polish literature and culture continue to be celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>

(January 17, 1881		Lviv-July 4, 1941			Lviv)


was
a Polish
mathematician.


					</p><p>Łomnicki was an important figure in the field of topology and is best known for his work on fixed point theory, a branch of topology that deals with the study of fixed points of continuous functions. He was a professor of mathematics at the University of Lviv, where he supervised the doctoral dissertations of several prominent mathematicians.</p><p>Łomnicki was also an active member of the Polish Mathematical Society and served as its president from 1931 to 1933. He was a strong advocate for the development of mathematics in Poland and worked to establish closer relationships with mathematicians from other countries. </p><p>Despite his achievements, Łomnicki's life was cut short when he was arrested by the Gestapo during World War II and executed in Lviv in 1941. His contributions to mathematics continue to be recognized and his legacy lives on through the numerous mathematical concepts and theorems that bear his name.</p><p>One of the most significant contributions made by Antoni Łomnicki to topology was his work on the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem. His research in this area led to the development of the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, which became one of the fundamental theorems of algebraic topology. Łomnicki's work on fixed point theory also helped establish the principle of continuity in mathematics, which states that small changes in the input of a function should result in small changes in the output.</p><p>In addition to his mathematical achievements, Łomnicki was also a devoted educator and mentor. He played a key role in the establishment of the Lviv Mathematical School, which produced many important mathematicians in the 20th century. Some of his notable students include Stefan Banach, Juliusz Schauder, and Stanislaw Ulam.</p><p>Łomnicki's tragic death at the hands of the Gestapo was a great loss to the field of mathematics. Despite this, his lasting impact on the development of topology and fixed point theory, as well as his contributions to mathematical education in Poland, continue to be celebrated today.</p><p>He was born into a family of mathematicians; his father was a professor of mathematics, and his mother was the daughter of a professor of astronomy. Łomnicki inherited his parents' passion for mathematics and pursued his studies at the University of Lviv, where he received a doctorate in mathematics in 1908. He then worked as a lecturer at the University of Lviv until 1913 when he moved to the University of Kraków, where he worked for the next ten years. In 1923, he returned to Lviv as a full professor of mathematics and remained there until his death. During his time at Lviv, he also held several administrative positions, including the head of the mathematics department and the dean of the science faculty. </p><p>Aside from his contributions to topology and fixed point theory, Łomnicki also published works on differential equations, mathematical physics, and algebra. He was also an active member of the Lviv School of Mathematics, a group of mathematicians who developed innovative research programs in various fields of mathematics.</p><p>Today, Łomnicki is remembered as a leading figure in the development of topology and fixed point theory. His work on the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem and the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem are still relevant and widely studied by mathematicians. His contributions to mathematical education in Poland also had a lasting impact, and his legacy continues to inspire young mathematicians today.</p><p></p><p>
