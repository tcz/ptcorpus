					</p><p>Having worked as a lecturer at the University of London, Hodin was renowned for his expertise in art history, particularly in 20th-century art. He wrote several influential books on artists such as Joan Miró, Pablo Picasso, and Wassily Kandinsky. In addition to his work as an art historian, Hodin was also a prolific essayist and commentator on cultural and political issues. He was a strong advocate for free expression and human rights, which he believed were essential to the preservation of cultural heritage. In recognition of his contributions to the arts, Hodin was awarded numerous honors throughout his career, including the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.</p><p>Hodin was born into a wealthy Czech Jewish family and grew up in Prague. He studied art history and aesthetics at Charles University in Prague, where he received his doctorate in 1932. Following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Hodin fled to England and became a naturalized British citizen in 1946.</p><p>In addition to his lectures at the University of London, Hodin also taught at the Courtauld Institute of Art and the University of California, Berkeley. He was instrumental in bringing the work of avant-garde European artists to a wider audience in the United States, including organizing exhibitions of Surrealist and Abstract art.</p><p>Hodin was also involved in the preservation of cultural heritage, particularly in his work with the National Trust of England. He was a vocal critic of the destruction of historic buildings during World War II and advocated for their protection and restoration.</p><p>Throughout his life, Hodin remained committed to his Czech roots and supported the cultural and political life of his home country. He was a member of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences and worked to promote Czech art and culture in London.</p><p>Hodin's contributions to the field of art history have been recognized by scholars and institutions worldwide. His writing on artists such as Miró and Kandinsky continue to be influential today.</p><p>Towards the end of his career, Hodin focused his attention on the work of British artists, particularly the painter John Piper. He produced a major retrospective of Piper's work at the Tate Gallery in 1983 and wrote a definitive study of the artist's life and work. Hodin was known for his ability to connect with artists on a personal level and his interviews with Piper provide valuable insights into the artist's approach and technique.</p><p>Hodin was also a skilled translator and played an important role in bringing the work of Czech writers to an English-speaking audience. He translated the poetry of Jiří Orten and the novels of Bohumil Hrabal, among others.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Hodin remained humble and deeply committed to his work. He was a beloved teacher and mentor to generations of students and his passion for art and culture inspired many. Today, he is remembered as a pioneering scholar and advocate for the arts, whose work continues to inspire and inform new generations of art historians and cultural commentators.</p><p>Hodin's personal life was also marked by tragedy. His parents, brother, and extended family were killed in the Holocaust, leaving him with a deep sense of loss and grief that would stay with him for the rest of his life. He also suffered from poor health, including a heart condition that required him to undergo surgery. Despite these challenges, Hodin remained committed to his work and continued to teach and write until his death in 1995, on his 80th birthday. Today, he is remembered as a brilliant scholar and generous mentor, whose legacy continues to inspire and enrich the field of art history.</p><p></p><p>
