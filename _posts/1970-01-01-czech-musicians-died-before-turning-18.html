(November 11, 1449		Poděbrady-March 8, 1464			Buda)


was
a Czech
personality.


					</p><p>She was the daughter of King George of Poděbrady and his second wife, Joanna of Rožmitál. Catherine was engaged to the Duke of Saxony at a young age, but the engagement was eventually broken off. She then became engaged to Matthias Corvinus, the future King of Hungary, in order to strengthen the political ties between the two countries. </p><p>Catherine and Matthias were married in 1463, but their union was short-lived as Catherine died in childbirth the following year at the age of 14. Their son, who was also named Matthias, survived and went on to become King of Hungary himself. </p><p>Despite her young age and brief life, Catherine played an important role in Czech and Hungarian history through her marriages and the political connections they fostered.</p><p>Catherine of Poděbrady was known for her intelligence and her mastery of several languages, which she demonstrated in her correspondence with prominent figures of her time. She was also an accomplished musician and patron of the arts. After her death, Matthias Corvinus was grief-stricken and went into mourning for several months. He later ordered the construction of a magnificent tomb for Catherine, which became one of the most important art pieces of the Renaissance in Hungary. The tomb was destroyed during the Ottoman occupation of Buda in the 16th century, but some of its fragments were recovered and can be seen today in the Hungarian National Museum.</p><p>Catherine's father, King George of Poděbrady, was a prominent figure in the Hussite movement, which was a Czech religious movement that was critical of Catholic practices. Catherine grew up in a household that was open to new ideas and perspectives. As a result, Catherine was well-educated and had a keen interest in politics and diplomacy.</p><p>In addition to her diplomatic skills, Catherine was also noted for her beauty. According to contemporary accounts, she was a strikingly beautiful young woman who captured the hearts of many. Her engagement to Matthias Corvinus was seen as a great coup for the Czech kingdom, as it brought the two countries closer together.</p><p>Despite her short life, Catherine had a lasting impact on Czech and Hungarian history. Her son Matthias became one of the most successful kings in Hungarian history, and his reign was marked by cultural and artistic flourishing. The tomb that Matthias commissioned for Catherine was not only a tribute to her, but also a symbol of his commitment to the arts and culture. Today, Catherine is remembered as a young woman who played an important role in shaping the politics and culture of her time.</p><p>Catherine of Poděbrady was born into a well-educated and artistic family. Her father, King George of Poděbrady, was not only a political leader but also a patron of the arts. He encouraged his daughter's interests in music and language, and she became fluent in German, Latin, and Czech. Catherine was also a skilled harpist and singer, and she often performed for her family and guests.</p><p>As a member of the royal family, Catherine was well-positioned to make important political connections through marriage. Her engagement to the Duke of Saxony was broken off for reasons that are not entirely clear, but it may have been due to political tensions between the two families. Her marriage to Matthias Corvinus, on the other hand, was a carefully arranged alliance between the Czech and Hungarian kingdoms. Despite their young age and the short duration of their relationship, Catherine and Matthias seem to have had a genuine affection for each other. Matthias was reportedly heartbroken at Catherine's death, and he commissioned the grandiose tomb as a tribute to her memory.</p><p>Catherine's role in Czech and Hungarian history was mostly ceremonial, as she died before she had a chance to exercise any real political power. However, her engagement and marriage to important political figures helped to cement alliances between the two countries. Her son, Matthias Corvinus, went on to become one of the most successful kings in Hungarian history, and he continued to promote the arts and culture that his mother had loved.</p><p>Today, Catherine of Poděbrady is remembered as a young woman who embodied the cultural and political aspirations of her time. Her tomb, despite being destroyed and fragmented, remains an important cultural and historical artifact, a testament to the enduring legacy of the Renaissance.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 2015		Cleveland-April 5, 2015			Red Wing)


was
a Czech
visual artist.


					</p><p>Known for his contributions to abstract art, Charles Biederman studied in Europe before returning to the United States to continue his artistic pursuits. He is best known for his sculptural pieces made from welded steel and painted in bright colors, often featuring geometric shapes and patterns. Biederman was a prominent figure in the Art Informel movement, which prioritized spontaneous, intuitive expressions of abstract art. In addition to his artistic practice, Biederman was also an influential art theorist, publishing several books that analyzed the meaning and purpose of abstract art in the modern world.</p><p>His most notable artwork is the Endless Column, which is on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Biederman's work has been exhibited in numerous galleries and museums throughout the world, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Centre Pompidou. He was also the recipient of several prestigious awards, including a Fulbright Fellowship and a Rockefeller Foundation Grant. Biederman's legacy continues to inspire artists today and his contributions to the world of abstract art are still celebrated and studied.</p><p>Despite his tremendous impact on the art world, Charles Biederman did not achieve widespread recognition for his work during his lifetime. In fact, he often struggled to make a living as an artist and was forced to take on various odd jobs to support himself and his family. Nevertheless, he remained committed to his artistic vision and continued creating groundbreaking works of art until his death in 2004 at the age of 98. Today, his legacy is honored through numerous art exhibitions and academic studies, which explore the rich and complex history of abstract art in the 20th century. Through his innovative use of color, form, and texture, Biederman challenged conventional ideas about art and pushed his contemporaries to think more deeply about the nature of creativity and expression. His work stands as a testament to the power of imagination and the enduring value of artistic experimentation.</p><p>Born to Czech immigrant parents, Charles Biederman was raised in Chicago and showed a strong interest in art from a young age. He studied at the Art Institute of Chicago before moving to Europe to continue his studies at the Académie Moderne in Paris and the Bauhaus in Dessau, Germany. It was during his time in Europe that Biederman developed his signature style of abstract art, which was influenced by the work of artists such as Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich.</p><p>After returning to the United States, Biederman settled in New York City where he became involved in the vibrant art scene of the 1930s and 1940s. He was a member of the American Abstract Artists group and participated in several of their exhibitions. However, Biederman's work was often not well-received by critics and he struggled to gain recognition for his art.</p><p>In addition to his artistic pursuits, Biederman was also a passionate advocate for the role of art in society. He believed that abstract art had the power to evoke emotional responses and convey universal truths that could not be expressed through representational art. Biederman's theories on art and creativity were explored in several books he authored throughout his life, including "Art as the Evolution of Visual Knowledge" and "The New Cézanne."</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced, Charles Biederman remained dedicated to his art and continued to create until the end of his life. His legacy has inspired generations of artists and his contributions to abstract art continue to be celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>
