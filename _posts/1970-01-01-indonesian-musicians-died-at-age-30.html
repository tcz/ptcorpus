was
an Indonesian
personality.


					</p><p>Arie Frederik Lasut was an Indonesian painter and nationalist. He was known for his contributions to the freedom movement that aimed to gain independence for Indonesia from Dutch colonial rule. Lasut was also the founder of the Proletaria Art Movement in Indonesia in the late 1940s, which sought to represent the plight of the common people through art. He was an active member of the Indonesian Communist Party and served as the chairman of the Central Committee of the Youth Wing of the party. Despite his relatively short life, Lasut was considered an important figure in Indonesia's political and cultural history.</p><p>Lasut was born in North Sulawesi in 1918, during a time when Indonesia was still under Dutch colonial rule. He grew up in a family of limited means, but was able to pursue his passion for art by attending the School of Fine Arts in Bandung. There, he honed his skills and developed his style, which would later be recognized as a unique contribution to the art world.</p><p>During his time at the School of Fine Arts, Lasut was also inspired by the growing nationalist movement in Indonesia. He became involved in political activism, joining the Indonesian Communist Party and advocating for independence from Dutch rule. He used his art to promote this message, creating pieces that reflected the struggles of the Indonesian people and the need for change.</p><p>In 1947, Lasut founded the Proletaria Art Movement, which aimed to bring art to the working class masses and give voice to their struggles. The movement had a significant impact on Indonesian art, paving the way for subsequent generations of artists to use their work as a means of social commentary and activism.</p><p>Sadly, Lasut's life was cut short when he was arrested by Dutch authorities in 1949. He was charged with treason for his involvement in the independence movement and was executed in Yogyakarta on May 7, 1949. Despite his untimely death, his contributions to Indonesian art and politics continue to be remembered and celebrated to this day.</p><p>Lasut's legacy in Indonesian art history also includes his unique style, which blended realism and expressionism to create powerful and emotive pieces. He often depicted the struggles of the working class and rural communities, highlighting the social and economic inequalities faced by many Indonesians.Lasut's art has been exhibited both nationally and internationally, with his works featured in prestigious museums and galleries around the world. In 2018, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth, a retrospective exhibition of his works was held at the National Gallery of Indonesia in Jakarta.Lasut's life and work continue to inspire generations of Indonesian artists and activists, who seek to use art as a tool for social change and progress.
