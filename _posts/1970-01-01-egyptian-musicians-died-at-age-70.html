Ahmed ‘Urabi is best known for his leadership of the Urabi Revolt, which he led alongside other Egyptian nationalist officers. The revolt sought to establish constitutional government and Egyptian sovereignty, but it was ultimately unsuccessful, and ‘Urabi was exiled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) following the British victory in 1882. After serving his sentence, he was allowed to return to Egypt and lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity. Today, he is regarded as a national hero and an important figure in the history of Egyptian nationalism.</p><p>Before his involvement in politics, Ahmed ‘Urabi began his military career as a commissioned officer in the Egyptian army.

The revolt was initially successful, and a constitutional government was established with ‘Urabi as Minister of War.</p><p>However, the British saw the revolt as a threat to their interests in Egypt and launched a military campaign to crush it. After several battles, British forces defeated the Egyptians at Tel el-Kebir in September 1882, and ‘Urabi was subsequently exiled.</p><p>Despite his exile, ‘Urabi remained an influential figure in Egyptian politics and a symbol of resistance against foreign domination. His legacy has continued to inspire nationalist movements throughout the region and beyond, and he is remembered as one of Egypt’s most important historical figures.</p><p></p><p>
