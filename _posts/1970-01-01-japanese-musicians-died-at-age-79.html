(December 3, 1879		Tokyo-April 30, 1959			Ichikawa)

	
		a.k.a. Nagai Kafu

	
was
a Japanese
novelist.


					</p><p>He is renowned for his depictions of Japanese society in the early 20th century, particularly that of Tokyo during the Taisho and Showa eras. Nagai Kafu grew up in an affluent family, which afforded him the opportunity to study English literature at Waseda University. He began his literary career as a journalist for several newspapers, including the Yomiuri Shimbun. However, it was his fiction writing that garnered him considerable acclaim. Some of his most famous works include "The Izu Dancer," "A Strange Tale from East of the River," and "The River Sumida and Hanako." Nagai Kafu's writing style was characterized by its realism and attention to detail, often delving into the inner lives of his characters. Despite his success, Nagai Kafu faced criticism for his depictions of women, which many saw as objectifying and misogynistic. Nevertheless, his contributions to Japanese literature have had a lasting impact, and he remains one of the most important writers of the Taisho era.</p><p>Later in his life, Nagai Kafu became interested in traditional arts such as tea ceremony, Noh theater, and woodblock prints. He wrote extensively about these subjects and even penned a book on the history of Japanese woodblock prints. Nagai Kafu also traveled extensively, spending time in China and Europe. He was a prolific writer, publishing over 120 works throughout his lifetime. In addition to his fiction writing, Nagai Kafu also translated works by Western authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Oscar Wilde into Japanese. He was awarded the Order of Culture by the Japanese government in 1952 for his contributions to literature. Nagai Kafu's work continues to be widely read and studied in Japan and has been translated into several languages for international audiences.</p><p>In his later years, Nagai Kafu became increasingly disillusioned with modern Japanese society and expressed nostalgia for the Edo period, which he saw as a time of greater cultural authenticity. This sentiment is evident in his novel, "Bokuto Kidan," which is set in the Edo period and explores the lives of samurai and commoners alike. Nagai Kafu's interest in traditional Japanese culture also led him to become a collector of art and antiques. He amassed a large collection of pottery, textiles, and other items, many of which he donated to museums and cultural institutions. After his death, his personal collection was sold at auction and dispersed among private collectors. Nagai Kafu's legacy as a writer and cultural observer continues to be celebrated in Japan, with numerous museums and literary societies dedicated to his memory.</p><p></p><p>
