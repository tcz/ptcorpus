Jannings continued to appear in German and international films throughout the 1930s, including "The Blue Angel" with Marlene Dietrich. However, his association with the Nazi Party and his acting in propaganda films during World War II caused his career to decline. After the war, he was blacklisted by Hollywood and returned to Europe where he acted in several films. Despite his controversial political views, Jannings's acting ability was praised by critics and has influenced actors to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=106405" title="Wikipedia article about Emil Jannings">Emil Jannings on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Eugen Neufeld</h2><p><strong>Eugen Neufeld</strong>
