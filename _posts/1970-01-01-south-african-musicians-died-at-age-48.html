Rhodes was also a prominent politician, serving as Prime Minister of the Cape Colony from 1890-1896. </p><p>Rhodes had a strong vision of a unified British Empire in Africa, known as the "Cape to Cairo dream," and worked to expand British influence in the region.

It has supported the education of many influential figures in politics, business, and academia, including Bill Clinton, Rachel Maddow, and Naomi Wolf.</p><p>Rhodes has been a controversial figure in history due to his views on race and his involvement in the exploitation of African resources.
