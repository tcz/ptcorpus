						Enrique Granados was born in Lleida, Catalonia, Spain and his musical talent was evident from a young age. He went on to study at the Paris Conservatory in 1887 with pianist Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot and composer Charles Lenepveu. After he returned to Spain, he became well-known as both a pianist and composer. He composed many works for the piano, including his famous suite for piano, Goyescas, inspired by the works of Francisco Goya. In addition to his musical talents, Granados was also a skilled painter and showed his works in exhibitions throughout his lifetime. He was tragically killed during World War I when the ship he was on was torpedoed by a German submarine in the English Channel. Despite his premature death, his works have continued to be popular and influential in the music world.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=556449" title="Wikipedia article about Enrique Granados">Enrique Granados on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/japanese-musicians-died-at-age-72.html' title='Japanese musicians died at age 72'><strong>Japanese musicians died at age 72</strong> List of the top 14 Japanese music stars who died when they were 72</a></li><li><a href='/argentine-musicians-died-at-age-24.html' title='Argentine musicians died at age 24'><strong>Argentine musicians died at age 24</strong> List of the top 7 Argentine music stars who died when they were 24</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-musicians-died-at-age-36.html' title='Canadian musicians died at age 36'><strong>Canadian musicians died at age 36</strong> List of the top 3 Canadian music stars who died when they were 36</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/french-actresses-died-in-1992.html' title='French actresses died in 1992'><strong>French actresses died in 1992</strong> List of the top 5 French actresses who died in 1992</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-at-age-66.html' title='Famous actors died at age 66'><strong>Famous actors died at age 66</strong> List of the top 14 Famous actors who died when they were 66</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-musicians-died-in-myocardial-infarction.html' title='Canadian musicians died in Myocardial infarction'><strong>Canadian musicians died in Myocardial infarction</strong> List of the top 15 Canadian music stars who died in Myocardial infarction</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
