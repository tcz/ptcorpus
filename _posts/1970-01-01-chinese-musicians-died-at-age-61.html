was
a Chinese
personality.


					</p><p>Puyi was the last emperor of China, who ascended to the throne at the age of two following the abdication of his uncle. He was the nominal ruler of China until the revolution of 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty. After his abdication, Puyi was forced to leave the Forbidden City and became a puppet emperor of Manchukuo, a state established by Japan in Northeast China. He was later captured by the Soviet Union in 1945 and imprisoned until 1950, when he was handed over to the People's Republic of China government. During the Cultural Revolution, Puyi was forced to undergo "rehabilitation" and participated in various manual labor tasks. He later worked as a gardener, librarian, and researcher in the Palace Museum in Beijing until his death in 1967.</p><p>Puyi was born into the Aisin-Gioro clan, the imperial family of the Qing dynasty, on February 7, 1906, in Beijing. His birth name was Henry Pu-yi, but he was later given the reign title Xuantong when he ascended the throne. Following the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Puyi's life took a turn, as he was forced to abdicate the throne and leave the Forbidden City.</p><p>During his time in Manchukuo, Puyi was installed as the 'Emperor of Manchukuo' by the Japanese, but was ultimately powerless. After the Japanese were defeated in the Second World War, Puyi was captured by the Soviet Union and imprisoned on charges of war crimes. During his confinement, Puyi was subjected to interrogation and questioning but was later released in 1950 and returned to China.</p><p>Following his imprisonment, Puyi was forced to submit to the Communist government's political re-education, where he was taught about the devastation that the imperial system had wrought upon China. Puyi was eventually allowed to return to Beijing, where he worked at the Palace Museum as a gardener, librarian, and researcher.</p><p>Despite being removed from the throne and compelled to live a difficult life with numerous controversies, Puyi still remains a legendary and enigmatic character, who has been portrayed in books, movies, and documentaries. His story, which spans the end of the imperial era in China to the advent of Maoist China, remains a fascinating window into the past of this great country.</p><p>Puyi's life was documented in his autobiography, "From Emperor to Citizen." The book covered his life from childhood until his imprisonment by the Soviet Union. It was later adapted into a film by director Bernardo Bertolucci, titled "The Last Emperor," which won nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, in 1988. Puyi's life and legacy continue to fascinate historians and the public alike, as he represents the end of an era in Chinese history and the beginning of a new, Communist China. Despite his troubled life, Puyi is remembered for his humility and forgiveness towards those who wronged him, and for his willingness to learn and accept his place in history.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of cardiovascular disease.
