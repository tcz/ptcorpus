He is best known for his collaborations with jazz legend, Billie Holiday, as well as his work with the big band leader, Benny Goodman.</p><p>Sauter started his career as a trumpet player, but soon shifted his focus to arranging and composing. He worked with a number of big band leaders throughout the 1930s and 1940s, including Jimmy Dorsey and Artie Shaw.</p><p>In the mid-1940s, Sauter teamed up with Billie Holiday to create some of her most memorable recordings, including "Lover Man" and "Don't Explain". He also worked with Goodman during this time, arranging some of his most famous performances, including "Sing, Sing, Sing".</p><p>Sauter continued to compose and arrange music throughout the 1950s and 1960s, working with a range of artists, from Frank Sinatra to the experimental composer, John Cage. He passed away in 1981 at the age of 66.</p><p>Despite being self-taught, Eddie Sauter quickly established himself as one of the most innovative and influential arrangers in jazz. His style was marked by complex harmonies, unusual instrument combinations, and unexpected tempo changes. Sauter was also a pioneer in the use of electronic instruments, incorporating the Ondes Martenot (an early electronic musical instrument) into his compositions as early as the 1940s. This experimentation led to some of his most famous works, including the "Focus" suite, a collaboration with famed jazz trumpeter, Stan Getz, which was one of the first jazz compositions to include a solo for an electronic instrument.</p><p>In addition to his work in jazz, Sauter also composed classical music, including pieces for orchestra and chamber ensembles. Later in his career, he became a sought-after composer for television and film, creating scores for shows like "The Twilight Zone" and films such as "The Last Picture Show". Eddie Sauter's legacy continues to influence jazz and other genres of music to this day.</p><p>Sauter was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. His father was a violinist and conductor, and his mother was a pianist, which gave him a musical upbringing from an early age. He started playing the trumpet in his teens and began arranging music shortly thereafter. Sauter's career soared after collaborating with Billie Holiday and Benny Goodman. In the 1950s, Sauter formed a close partnership with saxophonist Stan Getz, creating multiple albums together. His talent for scoring also landed him projects in films, including "The Man with the Golden Arm" and "Anatomy of a Murder". Sauter was a unique and unconventional artist, often incorporating experimental techniques into his work. He used extended techniques for orchestration, such as playing strings with a ruler or fingertips, as well as electronic instruments, like the Theremin. Throughout his career, Sauter received several accolades and honors for his contributions to music. The Jazz Journalists Association included him in their Jazz Hall Of Fame in 1983.</p><p></p><p>
