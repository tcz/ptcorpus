						</p><p>Louis Riel was a controversial figure in Canadian history, often seen as a hero by some and a traitor by others. He was a leader of the Métis people, who are of mixed European and Indigenous ancestry, and fought for their rights and the rights of Indigenous people in what is now Manitoba and Saskatchewan.</p><p>Riel played a key role in the formation of the province of Manitoba in 1870, but also led two rebellions against the Canadian government in 1870 and 1885. He was captured and convicted of treason in 1885, and despite appeals for clemency from many Canadians, including members of Parliament and the Catholic Church, he was hanged in Regina on November 16, 1885.</p><p>Over time, Riel has been widely recognized as a Métis leader who fought for the rights and recognition of his people, and his role in Canada's history has been reevaluated. In 1992, he was officially declared a founder of Manitoba, and in 2019, he was recognized as a hero and a martyr by the Canadian government.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of hanging.
