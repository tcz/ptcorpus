						</p><p>Charlie Holmes was an American jazz saxophonist and bandleader. He was known for his powerful and soulful playing style, and was a prominent figure in the Boston jazz scene during the 1930s and 1940s. Holmes began his musical career playing clarinet, but switched to tenor saxophone after hearing Coleman Hawkins play in New York City in 1932. He went on to lead his own bands, and also performed with prominent jazz musicians such as Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Goodman. In addition to his performing career, Holmes was also a respected music educator, teaching at Boston Conservatory and Berklee College of Music. He passed away in 1985 at the age of 75.</p><p>Holmes was born into a musical family - his father was a professional trumpet player and his mother was a singer. He began playing clarinet at a young age and won several local contests. However, after attending a concert by Coleman Hawkins in 1932, he was inspired to switch to tenor saxophone.</p><p>In the mid-1930s, Holmes formed his own band, the Charlie Holmes Orchestra, which became one of the most popular groups in the Boston area. The band played regularly at the Savoy Cafe and Ritz Ballroom, and also toured throughout New England. </p><p>Holmes' big break came in 1938 when he was hired by Duke Ellington to play in his band for a stretch of performances in Boston. This led to other high-profile gigs, including performances with Lionel Hampton and Benny Goodman.</p><p>Holmes was known for his improvisational skills and his ability to breathe emotion into his performances. He was a mentor to many younger musicians in the Boston area, some of whom went on to become jazz legends in their own right.</p><p>In addition to his career as a performer and educator, Holmes was also a composer and arranger. He composed many original pieces and arranged music for his own band as well as for others.</p><p>Holmes was inducted into the Boston Jazz Hall of Fame in 2012 and his legacy continues to inspire musicians and jazz aficionados alike.</p><p>Throughout his career, Charlie Holmes remained committed to his craft and was dedicated to passing his knowledge and skills on to future generations of musicians. He began teaching at the Boston Conservatory in the early 1950s, and subsequently joined the faculty at Berklee College of Music in 1965, where he remained until his retirement in 1980. Among his many notable students were saxophonist Archie Shepp and trumpeter Thara Memory. </p><p>Holmes was also an advocate for civil rights and played a part in breaking down racial barriers in the music industry. In the 1940s, he led an integrated band in Boston, which was a rare occurrence at the time. In addition, he was involved in organizing concerts and benefits for black musicians and their families who were in financial need.</p><p>Despite his contributions to the music world, Charlie Holmes remained relatively unknown outside of Boston, and he never achieved the widespread recognition that he deserved. However, his impact on the local scene was profound, and he left a lasting legacy as a talented musician, teacher, and advocate for social justice.</p><p></p><p>
