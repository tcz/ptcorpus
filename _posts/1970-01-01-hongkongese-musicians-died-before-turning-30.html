						</p><p>Josephine Bracken is best known for being the common-law wife of Philippine national hero, Jose Rizal. They met in Dapitan, Philippines in 1895 where Josephine's father sought medical advice from Rizal. Despite the disapproval of Rizal's family due to their religious differences (Josephine was a Catholic and Rizal a freemason), they fell in love and exchanged vows a few hours before Rizal's execution in 1896. </p><p>Prior to meeting Rizal, Josephine lived a difficult life as a daughter of an Irish sergeant of the British army and a Spanish mestiza mother. She was orphaned at an early age and worked as a seamstress and governess. In 1894, she went to Hong Kong where she met Rizal's friend and confidante, Edilberto Evangelista. </p><p>After Rizal's execution, Josephine returned to Hong Kong and gave birth to their son who was named after his father. She then moved to Manila and became a teacher at the Centro Escolar University. Josephine also established a school for women in Talisay, Cebu but was unable to run it due to her worsening tuberculosis. She spent the last years of her life seeking treatment in Hong Kong until her death in 1902 at the age of 25.</p><p>Josephine Bracken's relationship with Jose Rizal was controversial and highly debated among historians. Some believed that she was used by the Spanish government to spy on Rizal and gather information about his revolutionary plans. However, others argued that Josephine genuinely loved Rizal and supported his advocacy for Philippine independence. Despite the controversy surrounding their relationship, Josephine remained a prominent figure in Philippine history and her story continues to be told in books, films, and other forms of media. In 2018, a statue of Josephine was unveiled in Hong Kong to honor her life and the important role she played in Philippine history. Today, she is remembered as a woman of courage and determination who overcame adversity to make a significant impact on the world.</p><p></p><p>
