He was known for his distinctive voice and experimental sound that incorporated elements of dub, roots and electronic music. Sherman started his career in music in the late 1960s as a member of The Wailing Souls and later, The Yardbrooms. He then went on to work with Lee "Scratch" Perry, Horace Andy and many others. In 1982, Sherman founded the label Century Records, which released his own music as well as that of other artists.
