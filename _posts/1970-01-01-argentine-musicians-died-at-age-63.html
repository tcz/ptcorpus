was
an Argentine
writer and journalist.


					</p><p>Lugones is considered to be one of the most important Argentine writers of the early 20th century and one of the founders of modernist poetry in Latin America. He was a prolific author, writing in a variety of genres including poetry, essays, fiction, and criticism. Lugones believed that art should be nationalistic and embrace the traditions and culture of his country. He was a controversial figure in his time due to his political beliefs and association with the ruling elite. Despite this, his works continue to be studied and celebrated today for their artistic contributions to Argentine and Latin American literature.</p><p>Leopoldo Lugones was born into a middle-class family in the town of Villa de María del Río Seco in the northern province of Córdoba. He received his early education in his hometown and later went to the National University of Córdoba where he studied law. However, he never practiced law and instead became interested in journalism and literature.</p><p>Lugones worked as a journalist and began publishing his work in the magazine "Caras y Caretas". He later became the editor of the same magazine and helped to establish its reputation as one of the most important cultural and literary publications in Argentina. He also worked for other newspapers and magazines, including "La Nación", one of the most prominent newspapers in the country.</p><p>Lugones' literary career began in the late 19th century when he published his first book of poetry, "Las montañas del oro". He quickly gained recognition for his work and went on to publish many more books of poetry, including "Los crepúsculos del jardín" and "Lunario sentimental", which are considered to be some of his most important works.</p><p>In addition to his poetry, Lugones was also known for his essays, criticism, and fiction. He was deeply interested in the history and culture of Argentina and believed that art should reflect and celebrate the national identity of the country. As a result, his work often explores themes related to Argentine history and folklore.</p><p>Lugones was a controversial figure in his time due to his political beliefs and association with the ruling elite. He was a supporter of the conservative government and was critical of leftist movements in Argentina. Despite this, his work continues to be celebrated and studied today for its artistic contributions to Argentine and Latin American literature.</p><p>Tragically, Lugones died by suicide on February 18, 1938, in the town of Tigre, Buenos Aires Province. He was 63 years old at the time of his death.</p><p>Lugones' suicide was a shock to many of his readers and colleagues, and the circumstances surrounding his death remain unclear to this day. Some speculate that his conservative political beliefs had put him at odds with the changing social and political landscape of Argentina, leading to feelings of isolation and despair. Others believe that he may have been struggling with personal issues, including financial difficulties and marital problems.</p><p>Regardless of the cause of his death, Lugones' legacy as a writer and cultural figure in Argentina remains strong. His contributions to modernist poetry and his efforts to promote cultural nationalism have had a lasting impact on Argentine literature and society. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures in the country's intellectual and artistic history.</p><p>Lugones' literary work was not limited to poetry, essays, and fiction. He also wrote plays and translated the works of foreign authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman into Spanish. His translations played an important role in introducing these authors to the Spanish-speaking world.</p><p>In addition to his literary accomplishments, Lugones was also involved in politics. He served as a member of the Argentine National Congress for a brief period and was a vocal advocate for conservative ideology. His political views, which were considered to be controversial by many, often reflected in his writing and speeches.</p><p>Despite his controversial political views, Lugones was widely recognized for his literary achievements during his lifetime.
