torero.


					</p><p>Arruza was widely recognized as one of the greatest bullfighters in the history of the sport. He began his career at the age of 14 and quickly rose through the ranks with his skill and bravery in the ring. He was known for his smooth and fluid style, as well as his ability to improvise and adapt to the behavior of each bull he faced.</p><p>Arruza also had a successful career as an actor and appeared in several films, including the 1951 version of "The Brave Bulls," a biographical film about his life. He was also known for his outspoken personality and his controversial views on bullfighting, which he believed should be judged as an art form rather than a blood sport.</p><p>Tragically, Arruza died at the age of 46 in a plane crash while traveling to a bullfight in Toluca. Despite his early death, he left a lasting legacy as a torero and cultural icon in Mexico and beyond.</p><p>Arruza is considered as a pioneer in the world of bullfighting for his innovative approach to the sport. He was known for his use of the "suerte de la crinoline," a maneuver where he would get down on one knee and use his cape to entice the bull to charge at him. He was also known for his daring "manoletina," where he would stand still in front of the charging bull and use his cape to sway it away at the last moment. </p><p>In addition to his bullfighting and acting career, Arruza was also a writer and poet. He published a collection of his poems in 1951, titled "Cantos a la Muerte." His poetry explored themes of death, love, and the human experience.</p><p>Arruza's legacy continues to inspire future generations of bullfighters, and he has been immortalized in various forms of art and media, including the 1978 biographical film "Arruza" directed by Budd Boetticher.</p><p></p><p>
