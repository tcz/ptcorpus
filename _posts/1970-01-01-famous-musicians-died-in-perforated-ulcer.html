						Parker is considered one of the most influential jazz musicians in history, and is credited with co-founding the musical style known as bebop. He began playing the saxophone at a young age and was largely self-taught. He first gained recognition in the 1940s as a member of the Jay McShann Orchestra before forming his own groups. Despite struggling with drug addiction throughout his career, Parker continued to produce innovative and powerful music until his death at the age of 34. In addition to his work as a musician, Parker was also a composer who wrote numerous jazz standards, including "Ornithology," "Scrapple from the Apple," and "Anthropology." He has been posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, the Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=54408" title="Wikipedia article about Charlie Parker">Charlie Parker on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/english-musicians-died-in-bleeding.html' title='English musicians died in Bleeding'><strong>English musicians died in Bleeding</strong> List of the top 2 English music stars who died in Bleeding</a></li><li><a href='/ghanaian-musicians-died-at-age-68.html' title='Ghanaian musicians died at age 68'><strong>Ghanaian musicians died at age 68</strong> List of the top 2 Ghanaian music stars who died when they were 68</a></li><li><a href='/cuban-musicians-died-before-turning-30.html' title='Cuban musicians died before turning 30'><strong>Cuban musicians died before turning 30</strong> List of the top 6 Cuban music stars who died before 30</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swedish-actors-died-in-2008.html' title='Swedish actors died in 2008'><strong>Swedish actors died in 2008</strong> List of the top 5 Swedish actors who died in 2008</a></li><li><a href='/turkish-musicians-born-in-1970.html' title='Turkish musicians born in 1970'><strong>Turkish musicians born in 1970</strong> List of the top 11 Turkish  music stars who died in who were born in 1970</a></li><li><a href='/cuban-musicians-died-at-age-28.html' title='Cuban musicians died at age 28'><strong>Cuban musicians died at age 28</strong> List of the top 1 Cuban music stars who died when they were 28</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
