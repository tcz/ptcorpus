(December 15, 1857		Bucharest-June 5, 1893			Buenos Aires)


was
an Argentine
personality.


					</p><p>He was a Romanian engineer, explorer, and adventurer who became notorious for his brutal treatment of indigenous people during his expeditions in Patagonia. Popper is considered a controversial figure due to his involvement in the genocide of the Selk'nam people and his ruthless exploitation of the natural resources in the region. He is also known for introducing hydraulic mining to Argentina and for his role in establishing the Jewish colony of Moises Ville in the province of Santa Fe. Despite his controversial legacy, Julius Popper remains a prominent figure in Argentine history and has inspired literature, films, and historical studies.</p><p>Popper was born in Bucharest, Romania, but he was raised in Austria and studied engineering in Vienna. In 1885, he traveled to Argentina, where he became fascinated with Patagonia and its natural resources. He quickly built a reputation for being ruthless in his pursuit of wealth and power, and he was known to use violent tactics to achieve his goals.</p><p>Popper's most infamous expedition was his "Conquest of the Desert," which aimed to exterminate the indigenous inhabitants of Patagonia and clear the way for European settlers. His methods were brutal, and he engaged in mass killings, forced marches, and other atrocities. As a result, the Selk'nam people were almost entirely wiped out, leaving behind only a few survivors.</p><p>Despite his reputation as a ruthless conqueror, Popper was also known for his contributions to the development of the Argentine economy.

He was also an accomplished explorer, and he led several expeditions into the mountains and wilderness areas of Patagonia, where he discovered new mineral deposits and mapped previously unexplored regions. </p><p>However, Popper was also a controversial figure in his own time, and he was often criticized for his ruthless tactics and brutal treatment of indigenous people. Many of his contemporaries saw him as a dangerous and unstable figure, and he was often at odds with other entrepreneurs and political leaders in the region. Despite his flaws, however, Popper remains an important figure in Argentine history, both for his contributions to the development of the country and for the lessons that his life and legacy can teach us today.</p><p></p><p>
