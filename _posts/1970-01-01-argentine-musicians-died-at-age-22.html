However, his literary talents soon became evident, and he began writing essays, novels, and poetry.</p><p>Pelegrina was a key figure in the literary movement known as "La Córdoba Atómica," a group of writers who sought to redefine Argentine literature in the aftermath of World War II. His work often tackled existential themes and explored the human condition in a profound and thought-provoking way.</p><p>Aside from his literary pursuits, Pelegrina was also a well-respected translator, having translated works by authors such as William Faulkner and Albert Camus into Spanish.

In addition to his writing, Pelegrina was also a professor of literature at the National University of Córdoba, where he influenced countless students with his passion for language and literature. He also served as a cultural attaché in the Argentine embassy in Paris in the early 1960s. </p><p>Pelegrina's personal life was marked by tragedy. He lost his first wife to suicide in 1949, and his second wife died of cancer just a few years later. Despite these hardships, he continued to write and publish, leaving behind a substantial body of work that includes essays, novels, plays, and several volumes of poetry. His work has been praised for its sensitivity, its lyricism, and its ability to delve into the complexities of the human soul. Today, Manuel Pelegrina is regarded as one of the most important writers of mid-20th century Argentina.</p><p>In addition to his literary and academic pursuits, Manuel Pelegrina was also involved in politics. He was a strong supporter of Juan Perón's government, and in 1951, he was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies as a Peronist representative for the province of Córdoba. However, he quickly became disillusioned with Perón's government and eventually resigned from his position in protest. Pelegrina was also a vocal opponent of the military governments that ruled Argentina in the 1960s and 1970s, and he was forced into exile in Spain for a time due to his political activities. He returned to Argentina in the early 1980s and continued to write and publish until his death in 1992. Today, his legacy continues to inspire generations of Argentine writers and intellectuals.</p><p></p><p>
