(January 9, 1844		Spain-January 2, 1890)


was
a Spanish
singer.


					</p><p>He is widely considered to be one of the greatest operatic tenors of the 19th century. Born in the Navarre region of Spain, Gayarre began his career as a church choirboy before receiving formal training in Madrid. He made his professional debut in 1868 and quickly gained popularity in Spain and throughout Europe. Gayarre was known for his powerful voice, dramatic stage presence, and ability to convey emotion through his singing. He was particularly acclaimed for his performances in the operas of Verdi and was a regular at La Scala in Milan. Despite his fame, Gayarre remained committed to his roots, often performing in his native Basque language. He died at the age of 45 from complications related to pneumonia. Gayarre's legacy continues to influence modern opera singers and his recordings remain popular with classical music enthusiasts.</p><p>Gayarre's success was not limited to only European stages, but he also became highly popular in South America after undertaking a tour of the continent in 1889. He performed over 300 times during this tour and was received with great enthusiasm in countries like Argentina and Uruguay. Gayarre's talent was not restricted to singing as he was also a gifted actor and dancer, which added to his success as a performer. Furthermore, Gayarre was also known to be very dedicated to charity work and gave generously to causes that were dear to him. The composer Giuseppe Verdi was highly impressed by Gayarre's voice and personally invited him to perform in the premiere of his work "Aida" in Milan in 1872. In his short life, Gayarre accomplished much, and the House-Museum where he was born in Roncal, Navarre has become a place of pilgrimage for his many admirers, who continue to honor his immense contributions to the world of music.</p><p></p><p>
