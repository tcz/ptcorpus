									</h1><p>Here are 16 famous musicians from Austria died at 59:</p><h2>Joseph Johann von Littrow</h2><p><strong>Joseph Johann von Littrow</strong>
(March 13, 1781		Horšovský Týn-November 30, 1840			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
astronomer.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Karl L. Littrow and Heinrich von Littrow.

						</p><p>Joseph Johann von Littrow was born in Horšovský Týn, a town in what is now the Czech Republic. He went on to study at the University of Vienna and became a professor of mathematics and astronomy there in 1819. Littrow is best known for his work on mapping the moon, and he produced the first accurate map of the lunar surface in 1834. In addition to his work in astronomy, Littrow was also a skilled surveyor and cartographer, and he helped to develop accurate maps of Austria and Hungary. He was a member of many scientific societies and was awarded numerous honors for his contributions to astronomy and cartography. After his death in Vienna in 1840, his son Karl L. Littrow continued his father's work in astronomy and publishing.</p><p>Joseph Johann von Littrow was a prolific writer, publishing several works on astronomy and cartography. His most notable publications include "Atlas des Gestirnten Himmels" (Atlas of the Starry Sky), "Stellarum Fixarum imprimis duplicium et multiplicium Catalogus" (Catalogue of Fixed Stars, Especially Double and Multiple Ones), and "Uranometria Nova Oxoniensis" (New Uranometria of Oxford). Littrow's dedication to his work in astronomy and surveying was exemplified in his establishment of an observatory in Vienna which would later become the Vienna Observatory. His contributions to the scientific world also include his discovery of two comets named after him, the 68P/Klemola-Littrow and 231P/LINEAR-Littrow. In addition, Littrow is known for pioneering the use of electrotyping in the production of astronomical maps.</p><p>Littrow's interest in astronomy began at a young age, as he was inspired by the work of his father, a land surveyor who used astronomical instruments to make measurements. Littrow continued this family tradition, using his knowledge of astronomy to create maps that were accurate and up-to-date. His work also extended beyond the realm of science and into the world of politics. During the Napoleonic Wars, Littrow served in the Austrian army as a cartographer, and he was responsible for producing maps that were used by the military.</p><p>Despite his many achievements in astronomy and cartography, Littrow faced some criticism during his lifetime for his lack of focus on pure research. Instead, he was more interested in practical applications of his work, such as mapping the moon or creating accurate maps of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Nevertheless, his contributions to astronomy and cartography were significant and enduring, and continue to be studied and appreciated by scholars today.</p><p></p><p>

(January 27, 1836		Lviv-March 9, 1895			Mannheim)

	
		also known as Leopold Sacher-Masoch, Leopold Ritter von Sacher-Masoch, Gregor or Leopold Sacher Masock

	
was
an Austrian
writer and journalist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his novel "Venus in Furs," which explores themes of love, power, and submission. Sacher-Masoch's work often dealt with sensual and erotic themes, and his name has even been used as the basis for the term "masochism." Aside from his literary achievements, Sacher-Masoch was involved in politics and served as a member of the Austrian parliament. He was also an advocate for Ukrainian nationalism and a supporter of the idea of a united Slavic people. Sacher-Masoch's legacy has influenced numerous writers, artists, and filmmakers, and his works continue to be studied and admired to this day.</p><p>Sacher-Masoch was born in Lviv, which was then a part of the Austrian Empire and is now the city of Lviv in Ukraine. He grew up in a mixed cultural and linguistic environment, and he spoke German, Ukrainian, and Polish fluently. Sacher-Masoch studied law in Graz and later in Vienna but eventually turned to writing as his primary focus. He published his first novel, "The Legacy of Cain," in 1873, and it was well-received by critics. </p><p>In addition to his literary and political pursuits, Sacher-Masoch was interested in science and medicine. He received a degree in zoology and wrote several academic articles on the subject. He also studied medicine and became a doctor but never practiced. </p><p>Despite his success as a writer, Sacher-Masoch faced financial troubles throughout his life. He was frequently in debt and relied on loans from friends and family to support himself. He died in Mannheim in 1895 at the age of 59. </p><p>Sacher-Masoch's impact on literature and culture was significant, as his exploration of erotic themes and unconventional relationships pushed boundaries and challenged societal norms. His ideas about national identity and Slavic unity were also influential in their time and remain relevant today.</p><p>Sacher-Masoch was married three times and had several children. His first marriage was to Aurora von Rümelin, a wealthy and prominent woman from Augsburg, but they divorced in 1876. His second wife was a singer named Fanny Pistor, and they had three children together before divorcing. His third marriage was to Hulda Meister, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and they had two children before divorcing. Sacher-Masoch's personal life was often tumultuous, with affairs and scandalous behavior leading to strained relationships.</p><p>Despite his controversial subject matter in his writing, Sacher-Masoch was well-respected in his lifetime and received accolades for his work. He was awarded the Cross of Honor for Science and Art by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in 1884. Sacher-Masoch's work also influenced the development of psychoanalysis, with Sigmund Freud citing "Venus in Furs" as an important text in the study of human sexuality and psychology.</p><p>Today, Sacher-Masoch is remembered as a pioneering writer who pushed boundaries and explored taboo subjects. His work continues to be studied and debated by scholars and readers alike, and his legacy as a literary and cultural figure remains significant.</p><p></p><p>

(March 9, 1859		Vienna-January 19, 1919			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
writer.


					</p><p>He was known for his unique writing style, which was characterized by short, lyrical prose pieces that often had a witty or ironic tone. Altenberg was a well-known figure in the Viennese cultural scene, and he was associated with a group of writers and artists known as the Wiener Moderne, or the Vienna Modernists. </p><p>Despite his relatively short lifespan, Altenberg published a significant amount of work throughout his career. He wrote several collections of prose pieces, as well as plays, essays, and a novel. His writing often focused on the inner lives of his characters, and he was skilled at depicting the psychological nuances of human experience.</p><p>Altenberg was also known for his unconventional lifestyle. He was known to wander the streets of Vienna in a dressing gown and slippers, and he was a frequent patron of the city's coffeehouses and wine taverns. Despite his idiosyncrasies, he was a beloved figure in the city, and his writing continues to be celebrated for its unique style and insight into the human condition.</p><p>Altenberg's work was often controversial, and he was sometimes criticized for his use of frank and explicit language, as well as for his portrayal of taboo subjects such as sexuality and mental illness. Nevertheless, his writing was widely influential, and he was admired by many of his contemporaries, including Gustav Mahler, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Arthur Schnitzler.</p><p>In addition to his literary achievements, Altenberg was also known for his love of art and music. He was a frequent visitor to the Kunsthistorisches Museum and other cultural institutions in Vienna, and he was friends with prominent artists of the day such as Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele. He was also a talented pianist and composer, and his love of music can be seen in many of his writings.</p><p>Despite his success as a writer, Altenberg struggled with poverty and illness throughout much of his life. He suffered from various health problems, including tuberculosis and alcoholism, and he often relied on the support of friends and admirers to make ends meet. However, he remained committed to his art until his death in 1919, and he is remembered today as one of the most innovative and fascinating writers of his time.</p><p>Altenberg's unconventional lifestyle and controversial writing made him a prominent figure in the bohemian circles of turn-of-the-century Vienna. He was also known for his relationships with several women, including the actress Grete Wiesenthal and the artist Valerie Neuzil, who was the subject of several of his works. However, despite his many admirers and associates, Altenberg remained something of an outsider in the literary establishment, and he often struggled to gain recognition for his work.</p><p>In the years since his death, Altenberg's reputation as a writer has only continued to grow. His experimental style and psychological insights have made him a key figure in the development of modernist literature, and his influence can be seen in the work of writers as diverse as Franz Kafka, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf. Today, Altenberg is widely regarded as one of Austria's most innovative and important writers, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of readers and writers around the world.</p><p></p><p>

		a.k.a. Robert Barany or Dr. Robert Bárány

	
was
an Austrian
physician.


					</p><p>He was of Hungarian descent and received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1914 for his work on the physiology and pathology of the vestibular apparatus. The vestibular apparatus is the region of the inner ear that helps with balance and orientation. Bárány's research helped lead to advancements in the understanding and treatment of balance and vestibular disorders. He also contributed to the development of caloric testing, which is a tool used to diagnose vestibular disorders. Later in life, Bárány also worked as a professor of otology at the University of Uppsala in Sweden, where he passed away at the age of 59.</p><p>Aside from his contributions to the field of vestibular research, Bárány also made significant contributions during World War I. He served as a medic in the Austrian Army and was awarded the Silver Merit Cross for his heroism. He was captured by Russian troops and taken as a prisoner of war for seven months before being released in a prisoner exchange.</p><p>Bárány was also a pioneer in the field of aviation medicine, studying the effects of high altitude on the human body. He conducted experiments on himself and other volunteers, taking them up in balloons to study the physiological effects of high altitude. He also designed the Barany chair, an apparatus used for testing vestibular function which is still used in clinics today.</p><p>In addition to his Nobel Prize, Bárány received numerous other honors in recognition of his scientific achievements, including the Cameron Prize, the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, and the Pour le Merite. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of otology and vestibular research.</p><p>Bárány's legacy also extends to his contributions in the field of psychoacoustics. He conducted research on the subjective perception of sound, including sound localization and hearing thresholds. His work in this area helped to further our understanding of how the human ear processes sound, and it laid important groundwork for the development of modern hearing aids.In addition to his scientific achievements, Bárány was known for his bravery and character. He was widely respected by his peers and students, who valued his intelligence, humor, and kind nature. After his death, a memorial was erected in his honor in Uppsala, Sweden, where he had worked for many years. Today, his name lives on in the Bárány Society, an international organization of scientists and clinicians dedicated to the advancement of vestibular research.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 2015		Budapest-July 7, 1955)


was
an Austrian
psychologist.


					</p><p>Brunswik was best known for his work on perception and decision-making, particularly in the field of cognitive psychology. He studied at the University of Vienna and later at Harvard University, where he was influenced by the psychologist Edwin Boring. </p><p>His most famous contribution to psychology was the lens model, which he developed to study how people make decisions based on incomplete information. The lens model represents a mathematical model that relates an organism's perceptions to its judgments and is still used widely in research today. </p><p>Brunswik was also interested in the relationship between psychology and other social sciences, particularly economics. He believed that psychology had an important role to play in understanding people's decision-making behavior, which could inform economic theories of consumer behavior.</p><p>Although he died relatively young, Brunswik's work was influential in the development of cognitive psychology, and his ideas continue to inform contemporary research in the field.</p><p>Brunswik made significant contributions to the study of visual perception, particularly in the area of perceptual constancy, which states that our perception of an object remains constant despite changes in the viewing conditions. He also researched human judgement and created the concept of probabilistic functionalism, which explains how humans make use of heuristics or shortcut strategies when making decisions based on incomplete information.</p><p>Brunswik also emphasized the importance of ecological validity in psychological research, arguing that experiments should be conducted in real-life or naturalistic settings to ensure that the findings can be generalized to real-world situations. This concept is now a fundamental principle of psychological research.</p><p>Aside from his research contributions, Brunswik was also an accomplished teacher, mentor and advocate for the growth and development of psychology as a discipline. He was a founding member of the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues and was instrumental in bringing behavioral science to bear on pressing societal issues such as race relations, public health and education.</p><p>Today, Brunswik's legacy lives on through the continued use of his lens model in decision-making research, and his theoretical contributions to the study of perception and judgement still influence the field of psychology.</p><p>Brunswik was born into a middle-class family in Budapest, Hungary, in 1903. His father was a Hungarian Gypsy musician and his mother was a Hungarian-Jewish dentist. His family moved to Vienna, Austria, in 1913, where he later studied at the University of Vienna. After completing his PhD in philosophy in 1928, Brunswik began studying psychology and became increasingly influenced by the Gestalt psychologists. He went to study at Harvard University with Edwin Boring, and later worked with other prominent psychologists such as Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang Köhler. </p><p>Brunswik's work on the lens model was inspired by his interest in the practical application of psychological research to real-world decision-making problems. He believed that people make decisions based on incomplete and imperfect information, and that it was important to understand the cognitive processes involved in decision-making so that we could improve our decision-making abilities.</p><p>Brunswik's work continued to influence the field of psychology long after his death, and many of his ideas are still relevant today. His legacy is remembered not only for his groundbreaking work in perception and decision-making, but also for his commitment to using psychology in the service of society.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Fritz Lohner-Beda, Löhner-Beda, Fritz, Friedrich Löwy, Beda or Fritz Löhner

	
was
an Austrian
writer, lyricist and librettist.


					</p><p>Löhner-Beda started his career as a journalist and later became a successful lyricist and librettist. He worked with prominent composers such as Franz Lehár, Oscar Straus and Leo Fall, and penned the lyrics for popular operettas such as "The Merry Widow" and "The Love Parade". </p><p>Despite his success, Löhner-Beda's life took a dark turn when the Nazis came to power in his native Austria. As a Jew, he was persecuted and eventually deported to the Monowitz concentration camp in Poland, where he was murdered in 1942.</p><p>Löhner-Beda's legacy as a writer and lyricist lives on through his many contributions to the world of operetta and musical theatre. His tragic fate serves as a reminder of the atrocities of the Holocaust and the importance of preserving the memories of those who were lost.</p><p>In addition to his work in operetta and musical theatre, Fritz Löhner-Beda was also a prolific writer of cabaret songs and film music. He contributed to the soundtracks of German and Austrian films in the 1920s and 1930s, including the popular film "Zwei Herzen im Dreivierteltakt" (Two Hearts in Waltz Time). Despite the dangers of being a Jewish artist under Nazi rule, Löhner-Beda continued to write and create, even when he was forced to work as a slave laborer in the concentration camp. His unwavering spirit and artistic talent continue to inspire musicians and writers today. After his death in the camp, Löhner-Beda's wife and daughter were also murdered by the Nazis. However, his surviving son, Peter, went on to continue his father's legacy as a writer and translator.</p><p>Peter Löhner-Beda's death was a murder attributed to a burglary, but it is suspected that it may have been politically motivated. Despite these tragic losses, the legacy of Fritz Löhner-Beda lives on through his extensive body of work and the many performers who continue to sing his songs and bring his stories to life on stage. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Löhner-Beda's work, with several productions of his operettas being staged in Europe and beyond. His contributions to the world of musical theatre and cabaret continue to inspire artists around the world, and serve as a poignant reminder of the power of art in even the darkest of times.</p><p></p><p>

(September 14, 1862		Chernivtsi-May 2, 1922			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a renowned legal scholar and social philosopher who is regarded as one of the leading figures in the development of the sociology of law. Ehrlich studied law at the University of Vienna and eventually became a professor of law at the same institution, where he taught for over two decades. He is best known for his concept of "living law" or the idea that law is not simply a body of rules or statutes, but rather a complex and evolving social phenomenon that emerges from everyday human interactions. Ehrlich's work was influential in the development of other sociological approaches to law and he is still widely cited today as a major figure in the field.</p><p>Ehrlich's ideas about the nature of law and legal institutions also had a significant impact on the early 20th-century legal reform movement in Austria, which sought to modernize the country's legal system and make it more responsive to the needs of ordinary people. During this period, Ehrlich was a vocal advocate of legal reforms that would promote social justice and help to democratize the legal system. </p><p>Outside of his academic work, Ehrlich was known for his political activism and his involvement in various social and cultural organizations in Vienna. He was a prominent member of the city's Jewish community and served as the president of the Vienna Bar Association. Ehrlich was also a prolific writer and his works include a number of influential books and articles on legal theory, sociology, and cultural history. </p><p>Sadly, Ehrlich's life was cut short by illness and he died in Vienna in 1922, at the age of 59. However, his contributions to the sociology of law and his ideas about the nature of legal institutions continue to be studied and debated by scholars and practitioners in the field today.</p><p>Ehrlich's work in the sociology of law was not limited to theoretical concepts; he also engaged in empirical research. One of his most significant studies was a survey of the legal profession in Vienna, in which he sought to understand the ways in which lawyers operate in different social contexts. He found that lawyers often have different understandings of the law in different social environments and that their behavior is shaped by factors such as social class, religion, and nationality. This research helped to establish the importance of context and social dynamics in the study of law and legal institutions. </p><p>In addition to his influential work in the sociology of law, Ehrlich also made important contributions to the study of cultural history. He was an advocate for preserving the cultural heritage of the Jewish community in Vienna, and he played a leading role in the establishment of the Jewish Museum in the city. Ehrlich believed that cultural institutions were vital for preserving the memory and identity of marginalized groups and for promoting social cohesion. </p><p>Finally, Ehrlich was also a significant figure in the development of Austro-Marxist thought, which sought to reconcile Marxist theory with the social and cultural realities of Central Europe. He was associated with the left-wing intelligentsia in Vienna and was a vocal critic of the conservative political establishment. Ehrlich's work demonstrates the ways in which intellectual and political movements in early 20th-century Europe intersected and influenced one another.</p><p></p><p>

(July 18, 1552		Vienna-January 20, 1612			Prague)

	
		also known as Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor

	
was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>He was the eldest son of Emperor Maximilian II and was known for his interest in the arts, science, and occult studies. Rudolf II was fascinated by the mysteries of the universe and collected various scientific instruments, art pieces, and rare books. He is known for founding the Imperial Treasury in Vienna and the Kunstkammer Museum in Prague, which housed his vast collection of curiosities. During his reign, he also granted religious freedom to his subjects, which attracted intellectuals and philosophers to Prague, making it a center of culture and learning. However, his reign was also marked by political instability and the rise of Protestantism, which led to conflicts with neighboring countries. Rudolf II was eventually forced to abdicate his throne to his brother Matthias in 1608 and spent the remainder of his life in seclusion.</p><p>Rudolf II was also known for his support of famous astronomers, such as Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, who worked under his patronage. He was particularly interested in astrology and alchemy, and believed that through these practices he could gain insights into the hidden workings of the universe. He was also an avid collector of exotic animals and rare plants, which he kept in his gardens and menagerie. Despite being a patron of the arts, Rudolf II was also known for his bouts of depression and erratic behavior, which led many to question his ability to rule. His abdication marked the end of the Habsburg dynasty's dominance in the Holy Roman Empire, and the beginning of a period of political upheaval and conflict in Central Europe. Today, Rudolf II is remembered as an enigmatic figure who embodied the contradictions and complexities of the Renaissance era.</p><p>Rudolf II was also known for his passion for the occult and esoteric knowledge, which sometimes led him to make unconventional decisions. He was said to have consulted with astrologers and alchemists, and even believed that he could communicate with spirits and demons. His interest in the occult and his unusual behavior earned him a reputation as a madman in some circles.</p><p>Despite his problems, Rudolf II was a great patron of the arts and sciences. He commissioned many works of art and architecture, including the famous Rudolfine Tables, which were a detailed set of astronomical calculations. He also supported the work of many scientists, including the botanist Charles de l'Ecluse and the physicist Georg Joachim Rheticus.</p><p>Rudolf II's reign was not without controversy, however. His support for religious toleration angered many in the Catholic Church, and his inability to control the growing Protestant movement in his territories led to conflicts with neighboring countries. He was also involved in a long-standing conflict with his own brother, Matthias, who eventually forced him to abdicate his throne.</p><p>Despite his troubled reign, Rudolf II's legacy lives on in the many cultural and scientific achievements that were made under his patronage. His extensive collections of art and curiosities were dispersed after his death, but many of his works survive in museums and galleries around the world. He remains a fascinating figure in the history of the Habsburg dynasty and the Renaissance era.</p><p></p><p>

(January 20, 1841		Žamberk-September 26, 1900			Žamberk)


was
an Austrian
writer and surgeon.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering work in the field of ophthalmology, specifically in the treatment of glaucoma. Albert developed a surgical technique that involved making a small incision in the eye to reduce the pressure caused by glaucoma. This procedure, now known as the "Albert method," revolutionized the treatment of this condition and is still used by ophthalmologists today.</p><p>Outside of medicine, Albert was also a prolific writer. He wrote several novels, plays, and short stories, many of which were published under pseudonyms. His literary works often explored themes of social commentary and satire, and were popular throughout Austria and Germany during the late 19th century.</p><p>In addition to his medical and literary pursuits, Albert was also involved in local politics. He served as mayor of his hometown of Žamberk for several years, and was a prominent member of the Austrian Social Democratic Party.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Albert's life was not without its hardships. He suffered from depression throughout much of his adult life, and ultimately committed suicide in 1900 at the age of 59. Despite this tragic end, his contributions to the field of medicine and literature continue to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Born to a family of Jewish descent, Eduard Albert studied at the University of Vienna and received his medical degree in 1864. He then spent several years as a surgeon in the Austrian army before returning to his hometown to open a private practice. His interest in ophthalmology began in the 1870s, when he became fascinated by the complexity of the eye and the challenges of treating conditions such as glaucoma. His pioneering work in this field earned him international recognition, and he was invited to present his research at medical conferences around Europe.</p><p>Albert's literary career was equally impressive. He wrote over a dozen novels, including "The Penitent" and "The Temptation of Tony," which were widely read and translated into several languages. He was also a regular contributor to newspapers and journals, and wrote several plays that were performed in Vienna and other cities. Despite his success as a writer, Albert remained modest and was known to be generous to young authors and aspiring poets.</p><p>In addition to his medical and literary work, Albert was an active member of the local community. He served on the town council of Žamberk, and was involved in the establishment of several social and cultural organizations. He was a strong advocate for workers' rights and was known to be critical of the Austro-Hungarian government's treatment of its citizens.</p><p>Despite his numerous accomplishments, Eduard Albert's life was marked by personal struggles. He suffered from bouts of depression and was known to abuse alcohol. In 1900, he took his own life by shooting himself in his home in Žamberk. His death was widely mourned, and he was remembered as a gifted writer, a skilled physician, and a dedicated public servant.</p><p>Albert's legacy in the medical field lives on through the enduring impact of his work on glaucoma treatment. His surgical technique, which involved making a small incision in the eye, is still widely used in modern ophthalmology. By reducing the pressure caused by glaucoma, Albert's method has helped preserve or improve the vision of countless patients. In recognition of his contributions, the Eduard Albert Medal, awarded annually by the Czech Glaucoma Society, honors ophthalmologists who have made exemplary contributions to the field.</p><p>Beyond his medical and literary pursuits, Albert also had a passion for music. He played the piano and composed his own music, and was known to incorporate musical themes and motifs into his literary works. His love of music extended beyond his personal life as well; he was involved in the establishment of a local music school and supported the development of musical talent in his community.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced in his personal life, Eduard Albert's legacy lives on as a testament to the power of human creativity and innovation. Through his groundbreaking work in ophthalmology, his insightful and entertaining literary works, and his commitment to public service, he inspired countless others to strive for excellence in their own fields, leaving an enduring mark on the world.</p><p></p><p>

(June 1, 1884		Vienna-November 28, 1943			Chicago)


was
an Austrian
mathematician.


					</p><p>He is most famous for the Helly's theorem, which states that if n + 1 convex sets in n-dimensional Euclidean space have a non-empty intersection, then there exists a point that belongs to the intersection of all of them. Helly was also the first to prove a topological theorem about the existence of continuous, one-to-one functions between two manifolds of the same dimension, now known as the Helly-Bray theorem. Helly was forced to flee Austria after the Nazi takeover in 1938 and eventually settled in the United States, where he continued to work in mathematics until his death in 1943. He made many important contributions to mathematics in his lifetime and his work continues to be studied and appreciated by mathematicians today.</p><p>Prior to his forced exile, Helly held several academic positions in Austria, including a professorship at the University of Vienna. He also served as the editor-in-chief of the prestigious mathematics journal, Mathematische Annalen. In addition to his work in pure mathematics, Helly was also interested in the practical applications of mathematics, particularly in the fields of engineering and physics. He collaborated with engineers on projects related to the stability of structures, and his work on the intersection of convex sets was used in the design of electrical circuits. Helly was a member of several scientific academies and societies, including the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the German Mathematical Society. Despite the challenges he faced in his personal life, Helly remained dedicated to his work and continued to make significant contributions to the field of mathematics until his untimely death at the age of 59.</p><p>In addition to his work on Helly's theorem, Eduard Helly also made contributions to other areas of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. He introduced the concept of "Helly dimension" in algebraic geometry, which is a measure of the complexity of a projective variety. Helly also studied the stability of dynamical systems and the application of differential equations to physics. His work in these areas was particularly influential in the development of the modern theory of chaos.</p><p>During his time in the United States, Helly taught at several universities including the University of Notre Dame and the Illinois Institute of Technology. He also collaborated with several mathematicians and scientists, including Albert Einstein, who was a friend and colleague. Helly's legacy in mathematics is commemorated by the Helly Prize, which is awarded every two years by the Austrian Academy of Sciences to a mathematician who has made significant contributions to geometry, topology, or combinatorics.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Helly's life was marked by tragedy and turmoil. He was forced to flee his home, leaving behind his wife and children, and settle in a new country where he had to rebuild his career from scratch. He also suffered from depression and illness in his later years. However, through it all, Helly remained steadfast in his devotion to mathematics and his determination to make meaningful contributions to the field.</p><p></p><p>
