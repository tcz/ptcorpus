(January 1, 1873		Lagos de Moreno-March 1, 1952			Mexico City)


was
a Mexican
writer.


					</p><p>Azuela is best known for his influential novel "The Underdogs" ("Los de Abajo"), which depicts the experiences of a group of Mexican rebels during the Mexican Revolution. He studied medicine at the National School of Medicine in Mexico City, but later turned to writing. Azuela's works often focused on social issues and inequalities in Mexican society, and he was also a prominent critic of the Mexican government. In addition to "The Underdogs," Azuela wrote numerous other novels, essays, and plays throughout his career. He was an important figure in the Latin American literary movement known as the "novel of the Mexican Revolution," and was one of the first Mexican writers to gain international recognition.</p><p>Azuela was born to a wealthy family in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. During his youth, he witnessed firsthand the injustices and oppression suffered by Mexico's rural poor, which would later inspire much of his writing. In 1910, he became involved with the Mexican Revolution, initially supporting the revolutionaries. However, he became disillusioned with the brutality and chaos of the conflict, eventually leading him to flee to the United States in 1915.</p><p>During his time in the US, Azuela worked as a doctor and continued to write, focusing on themes related to exile, dislocation, and disillusionment. He eventually returned to Mexico in the 1920s and remained there for the rest of his life. Over the course of his career, Azuela won numerous awards and honors for his work, including Mexico's National Prize for Arts and Sciences in Literature. Today, he is remembered as a pioneering figure in Mexican literature and a leading voice on the social and political issues of his time.</p><p>Azuela's writing style was characterized by its realism and its use of colloquial language. He believed that literature should reflect the lived experiences of ordinary people, particularly those who were marginalized or oppressed. In addition to his literary work, Azuela was also involved in politics, and he supported several leftist movements throughout his life.</p><p>Despite his success as a writer, Azuela remained committed to social justice and continued to criticize the Mexican government for its treatment of the poor and disenfranchised. He was particularly critical of the government's suppression of free speech and the press, and he fought to defend the rights of journalists and other writers.</p><p>Azuela's impact on Mexican literature and politics has been significant, and his work has influenced several generations of Mexican writers. In addition to "The Underdogs," his other notable works include "Maria Luisa," "The Bosses," and "The Flies." He died in Mexico City in 1952, but his legacy continues to live on through his writing and activism.</p><p>Throughout his life, Mariano Azuela was not only a writer but also a political activist. He joined the Mexican Communist Party in the 1920s and was involved in several leftist movements. He also served as a member of the Mexican Congress, advocating for workers' rights and supporting land reforms.</p><p>In addition to his political and literary work, Azuela was a devoted family man. He met his wife, Alicia Reyes, while studying medicine in Mexico City, and they had six children together. Despite his busy schedule, Azuela always made time for his family, and his wife and children remained a source of inspiration for his work.</p><p>Azuela's impact on Mexican literature can be seen in the way he depicted the Mexican Revolution in his writing. "The Underdogs," in particular, revolutionized the way Mexican writers approached the subject, portraying the revolutionaries not as heroes but as flawed and complex individuals. His work also contributed to the development of the social realism movement in Mexican literature, which aimed to depict the struggles of everyday people.</p><p>Today, Mariano Azuela is remembered as one of Mexico's most important writers and a voice for social justice. His work continues to inspire readers and writers around the world, and his legacy remains an important part of Mexican cultural history.</p><p>In addition to being a writer, political activist, and family man, Mariano Azuela was also a respected physician. He graduated from the National School of Medicine in Mexico City in 1899 and practiced medicine for several years before turning to writing full time. However, Azuela never lost his passion for medicine and continued to practice as a doctor throughout his life, providing medical care to his community even during times of political turmoil. Azuela's dedication to improving the health and well-being of his fellow Mexicans was recognized by the Mexican government, which awarded him the National Prize for Public Health in 1949.</p><p>In addition to his medical and literary achievements, Mariano Azuela was also a lover of music. He was particularly fond of opera and enjoyed attending performances whenever possible. Azuela also played the piano and enjoyed composing his own music, although he never pursued it professionally. His love of music is evident in his writing, as many of his works contain references to musical compositions and themes. Azuela's wide-ranging interests and talents exemplify his multifaceted personality and his commitment to exploring and expressing different facets of Mexican culture. His contributions to literature, medicine, politics, and music have left an indelible mark on Mexican society and on the cultural landscape of Latin America as a whole.</p><p></p><p>

McMoon worked with Jenkins from 1932 until her death in 1944, and their collaborations became the stuff of legend, with Jenkins' off-key vocals juxtaposed against McMoon's skilled piano playing. Following Jenkins' death, McMoon continued to work as a pianist and composer, collaborating with other performers and writing his own music. In the 1950s, he moved to New York City, where he lived until his death in 1980. Despite his association with Jenkins and her notorious singing, McMoon remained a respected musician in his own right, with a talent and skill that transcended his most famous collaborator's limitations.</p><p>Born in Mapimí, Durango, Mexico in 1901, Cosmé McMoon began his musical education at the National Conservatory in Mexico City. While there, he studied piano, composition, and conducting. After completing his studies, McMoon worked as a music instructor and composer in Mexico. In the 1920s, he moved to the United States, where he continued to work as a piano accompanist for various performers.</p><p>It was in 1932 that McMoon began working with Florence Foster Jenkins, an amateur singer with dreams of becoming a professional opera soprano. Despite Jenkins' flawed singing, McMoon took the job as her accompanist, and the two began performing together regularly. Their concerts often drew large crowds, with audiences both fascinated and amused by Jenkins' unique style.</p><p>Throughout his career, McMoon worked with other performers, including the Mexican tenor Juan Arvizu and the American soprano Dorothy Sarnoff. He also wrote his own music, including works for piano, voice, and orchestra. In addition to his work as a pianist and composer, McMoon was known for his philanthropic efforts. He supported various organizations in Mexico and the United States, including the American Cancer Society.</p><p>Despite his success as a musician, McMoon is best remembered for his collaborations with Florence Foster Jenkins. Their recordings and performances have continued to attract new fans, and their partnership has been dramatized in films and plays. Despite the humor in their partnership, it is clear that McMoon's talent and skill were essential to Jenkins' performances, and he remains a respected figure in the world of classical music.</p><p>In 2016, McMoon's life and career were the subject of a film titled "Florence Foster Jenkins," starring Hugh Grant as McMoon and Meryl Streep in the titular role. The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for multiple Academy Awards. Many critics praised Grant's portrayal of McMoon, with some arguing that he stole the show from Streep. The film's success helped to solidify McMoon's legacy as a talented musician in his own right and shed light on his contributions to classical music history. Today, McMoon is remembered not only as the accompanist to an infamous singer, but as a gifted pianist and composer whose work deserves recognition and appreciation.</p><p>In addition to his musical career, Cosmé McMoon was known for his dedication to teaching music to young people. Throughout his life, he taught piano and composition to students in both Mexico and the United States. He believed that everyone should have access to music education, regardless of their background or financial situation, and worked tirelessly to bring music to underprivileged communities. McMoon's generosity and passion for music left a lasting impact on those he taught and inspired many to pursue their own musical dreams.</p><p>In his later years, McMoon continued to perform and collaborate with other artists. He played at various music festivals and events, receiving critical acclaim for his skillful piano playing. He also continued to compose music, including pieces for film and television.</p><p>Cosmé McMoon passed away in his home in New York City on August 22, 1980. Despite his association with Florence Foster Jenkins, he is remembered as a talented musician in his own right and a dedicated teacher and philanthropist. His contributions to classical music have been recognized and celebrated by music lovers and historians alike, cementing his place in music history.</p><p>Even though Cosmé McMoon is primarily known for his work with Florence Foster Jenkins, his individual performances were highly regarded by his contemporaries. According to pianist and composer Ned Rorem, McMoon's "tremendously facile and inventive" playing was both "tasteful and invaluable" in virtuoso performances, and he was highly respected by his colleagues in the music industry. McMoon's compositions have also been recognized posthumously, with several of his pieces receiving performances and recordings by modern musicians. He is remembered not only for his association with Jenkins but for his unique contributions to classical music as a skilled performer and creative artist.</p><p>In 2017, a collection of previously undiscovered compositions by Cosmé McMoon was found in a storage locker in New York City. The collection included dozens of original scores for piano, voice, and chamber ensembles. The pieces had been written between the 1920s and the 1970s, and many of them had never been performed or recorded. The discovery of the lost works generated excitement among classical music enthusiasts, and recordings of some of the pieces were later released. The performance of McMoon's compositions helped to bring new attention to his life and work, highlighting not only his skill as a performer but also his creative talent as a composer.
