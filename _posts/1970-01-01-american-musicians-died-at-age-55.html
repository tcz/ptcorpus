an American
politician.

Tweed became a member of the New York State Senate in 1868 and was later elected to the New York State Assembly. He also served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for one term. However, his true power came from his position as the head of Tammany Hall. Under his leadership, Tammany became known for its corruption and graft. In 1871, Tweed was exposed and convicted of embezzlement and was sentenced to prison. After his release, he was arrested again on charges of forgery but died before he could be tried.

The articles, written by political cartoonist Thomas Nast, depicted Tweed as a bloated, corrupt figure, which led to his nickname "Boss Tweed." Nast's illustrations were so influential that they helped to bring about Tweed's downfall.</p><p>Despite his criminal activities, Tweed was a complex figure and is still remembered by some as a champion of the working class. His legacy has been the subject of numerous books, films, and television shows, and his life and career continue to fascinate historians and political observers today.</p><p></p><p>

(January 26, 1884		Lębork-February 4, 1939			New Haven)


was
an American
linguist, scientist and anthropologist.


					</p><p>Sapir was best known for his contributions to the field of linguistics, particularly his research on Native American languages. He conducted extensive fieldwork on many indigenous languages, including Navajo, and was a pioneer in the study of linguistic relativity, which states that the structure of a language affects the way its speakers perceive the world.</p><p>In addition to his linguistic work, Sapir also made significant contributions to the fields of anthropology and psychology. He was a leading figure in the development of the anthropological concept of culture and believed that language and culture were deeply intertwined.</p><p>Sapir was a professor of anthropology and linguistics at the University of Chicago and later at Yale University. He wrote many influential books and essays throughout his career, including "Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech" and "Culture, Language and Personality."</p><p>Today, Sapir is considered one of the most important figures in the history of linguistics and his work continues to inspire and influence researchers in a variety of fields.</p><p>Sapir was born in what is now Poland and immigrated to the United States with his family when he was a small child. He grew up bilingual in Yiddish and English and later learned several other languages fluently, including French, German, and Spanish. This early exposure to multiple languages likely sparked his interest in linguistics.</p><p>As a young man, Sapir studied at Columbia University, where he received his Ph.D. in anthropology. He later went on to teach at several universities, including the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Pennsylvania, before ultimately settling at Yale.</p><p>Sapir's influence extended far beyond his academic work, including his involvement in the creation of a new alphabet for the Inuit language, which allowed for better communication and education for the Inuit people. He was also involved in the promotion of Native American art, particularly in the form of textiles and rugs.</p><p>Sapir's approach to anthropology and linguistics was deeply rooted in his belief in cultural relativism and his respect for the diversity of human experience. He believed that different cultures and languages could not be evaluated in terms of superiority or inferiority, but rather should be understood in their own terms.</p><p>Despite his significant contributions to the field of linguistics, Sapir's life was cut short when he died of a stroke at the age of 55. However, his legacy lives on, not only in his academic work but also in his dedication to understanding and appreciating the richness and complexity of human culture and language.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of stroke.

(March 25, 1911		Chicago-January 3, 1967			Dallas)

	
		also known as Jacob Rubenstein, Jack Leon Ruby, Jack L. Ruby or Sparky

	
was
an American
businessperson and aircraft maintenance technician.


					</p><p>However, Ruby is best known for the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged assassin of President John F. Kennedy, on November 24, 1963, two days after Kennedy's assassination. Ruby shot Oswald while he was being transferred from the Dallas Police Headquarters to the Dallas County Jail. Ruby's motive for the murder is still a subject of speculation and conspiracy theories. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, but his conviction was later overturned and a new trial was ordered. However, Ruby died before the new trial could take place. His involvement in the Kennedy assassination and his murder of Oswald continue to be the subject of intense public interest and debate.</p><p>Before his involvement with the Kennedy assassination, Jack Ruby owned several nightclubs in the Dallas area, including the Carousel Club. He was known to have connections with organized crime figures, and there are theories that he was either ordered or persuaded to kill Oswald by members of the mafia or other parties wanting to cover up the true nature of Kennedy's assassination.</p><p>Ruby himself claimed that he acted alone out of a desire to spare Kennedy's family the pain of a long trial and to avenge the president's death. He made several other statements in the days and weeks following the shooting, some of which contradicted each other, leading to further speculation about his true motives.</p><p>Despite the lack of consensus about his role in the assassination, Jack Ruby remains a figure of fascination and controversy in American history. His actions on November 24, 1963, are seen by many as a turning point in the investigation and public perception of Kennedy's death.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by stroke.
