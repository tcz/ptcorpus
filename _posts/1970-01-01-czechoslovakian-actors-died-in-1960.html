In 1921, he directed his first film, "The Green Tie," and went on to direct and star in several other films in the following years.

Despite this, the film's popularity and critical acclaim earned Pištěk international recognition. </p><p>Pištěk continued to direct and act in films until his death in 1960 at the age of 65. His legacy as a pioneering figure in Czechoslovakian cinema is still celebrated today.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=21251182" title="Wikipedia article about Theodor Pištěk">Theodor Pištěk on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/finnish-musicians-died-at-age-73.html' title='Finnish musicians died at age 73'><strong>Finnish musicians died at age 73</strong> List of the top 18 Finnish music stars who died when they were 73</a></li><li><a href='/hungarian-actors-died-in-2006.html' title='Hungarian actors died in 2006'><strong>Hungarian actors died in 2006</strong> List of the top 4 Hungarian actors who died in 2006</a></li><li><a href='/argentine-musicians-died-at-age-22.html' title='Argentine musicians died at age 22'><strong>Argentine musicians died at age 22</strong> List of the top 4 Argentine music stars who died when they were 22</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-complications-of-diabetes-mellitus.html' title='American actors died in Complications of diabetes mellitus'><strong>American actors died in Complications of diabetes mellitus</strong> List of the top 5 American actors who died in Complications of diabetes mellitus</a></li><li><a href='/georgian-musicians-died-before-turning-40.html' title='Georgian musicians died before turning 40'><strong>Georgian musicians died before turning 40</strong> List of the top 2 Georgian music stars who died before 40</a></li><li><a href='/turkish-musicians-died-at-age-48.html' title='Turkish musicians died at age 48'><strong>Turkish musicians died at age 48</strong> List of the top 3 Turkish music stars who died when they were 48</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
