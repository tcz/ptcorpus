(December 24, 1167		Beaumont Palace-October 19, 1216			Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire)

	
		a.k.a. Jean Sans Terre, John Softsword or John Lackland

	
was
an English
personality.


					
			
		He had
		six
		children,
		Henry III of England, Isabella of England, Joan of England, Queen of Scotland, Eleanor of Leicester, Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall and Joan, Lady of Wales.

						</p><p>John became King of England in 1199, succeeding his brother Richard the Lionheart. His reign was marked by conflict with the Church, particularly with Pope Innocent III, and with his own nobility. He is perhaps best known for signing the Magna Carta in 1215, which limited the power of the monarchy and established the principle that everyone, including the king, was subject to the law. Despite this legacy, he is also remembered for being a tyrant and a rapacious ruler who impoverished England through his wars and excessive taxation.</p><p>John's reign was marked by several military campaigns, including unsuccessful attempts to regain his ancestral lands in continental Europe. He famously lost the Duchy of Normandy in 1204 to King Philip II of France. He also faced rebellions from his own barons who were unhappy with his rule and heavy taxation. One of these rebellions led to the signing of the Magna Carta, which is seen as a significant step towards establishing English democracy and human rights. Despite this, John continued to rule without regard for his subjects' welfare and was deeply unpopular. He died in 1216, leaving his young son Henry III to succeed him as king. One of John's lasting legacies is his role in shaping the English legal system, with the Magna Carta paving the way for future legal reforms.</p><p></p><p>
