							Django Reinhardt was a pioneering jazz musician and one of the greatest guitarists of all time. He was born in Belgium to Romani parents and grew up in poverty. Despite his limited formal education and the loss of two of his fingers in a fire, he went on to invent a new style of music that blended traditional Romani music with jazz. His technical skill and improvisational genius inspired countless musicians and still influences guitarists today. Reinhardt recorded many classic albums with his bands, including the Quintette du Hot Club de France and the Django Reinhardt with the American jazz trumpeter Rex Stewart. He also composed many enduring jazz standards, such as "Minor Swing" and "Nuages". Sadly, Reinhardt's life was cut short at the age of 43 due to a brain hemorrhage. However, his legacy lives on and he remains a beloved figure in the history of jazz.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=9039" title="Wikipedia article about Django Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/indian-musicians-died-at-age-29.html' title='Indian musicians died at age 29'><strong>Indian musicians died at age 29</strong> List of the top 3 Indian music stars who died when they were 29</a></li><li><a href='/chilean-actresses-died-at-age-75.html' title='Chilean actresses died at age 75'><strong>Chilean actresses died at age 75</strong> List of the top 1 Chilean actresses who died when they were 75</a></li><li><a href='/spanish-actors-died-in-1977.html' title='Spanish actors died in 1977'><strong>Spanish actors died in 1977</strong> List of the top 2 Spanish actors who died in 1977</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/chinese-musicians-died-at-age-69.html' title='Chinese musicians died at age 69'><strong>Chinese musicians died at age 69</strong> List of the top 9 Chinese music stars who died when they were 69</a></li><li><a href='/belgian-actors-died-in-1981.html' title='Belgian actors died in 1981'><strong>Belgian actors died in 1981</strong> List of the top 1 Belgian actors who died in 1981</a></li><li><a href='/argentine-actors-died-at-age-35.html' title='Argentine actors died at age 35'><strong>Argentine actors died at age 35</strong> List of the top 1 Argentine actors who died when they were 35</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
