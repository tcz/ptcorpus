During his time playing in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, he was named to the QMJHL All-Rookie Team and later the QMJHL Second All-Star Team. Bourdon's NHL debut came in 2007, and he quickly became a solid defenseman for the Vancouver Canucks.</p><p>Aside from his successes in hockey, Bourdon was known for his charismatic personality, infectious grin, and his love for his family and friends. He was also an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed hunting and fishing.</p><p>Bourdon's death was a tragic loss for the Canucks organization and the entire hockey community. His number 28 jersey was retired by the Canucks, and a memorial scholarship was set up in his name to support young athletes in Shippagan.</p><p>Today, Bourdon is remembered as a talented athlete, a great teammate, and a beloved member of the hockey community. His legacy lives on through the memories and stories shared by those who knew him best.</p><p>Following Bourdon's tragic death, many of his former teammates and coaches spoke highly of him as both a player and person. Canucks head coach at the time, Alain Vigneault, praised Bourdon's character and work ethic, stating that "he was well-liked by his teammates, had a great sense of humor and was a hard worker."

He is also remembered by the Vancouver Canucks organization, who continue to honor his memory through their dedication to the Luc Bourdon Memorial Scholarship. This scholarship, which was established in 2008, provides support for young athletes in the Shippagan area who demonstrate the same passion, dedication and sportsmanship as Bourdon did throughout his hockey career.</p><p>Despite his tragic passing at a young age, Luc Bourdon's legacy as a talented athlete and a kind-hearted person has continued to inspire many. In 2011, a documentary called "Luc Bourdon: L'h√©ritage d'un espoir" (Luc Bourdon: The Legacy of a Hope) was released, chronicling his life and legacy.
