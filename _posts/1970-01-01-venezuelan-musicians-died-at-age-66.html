		also known as Henri Charriere, Papillon or Papi

	
was
a Venezuelan
writer.


					</p><p>Charrière was best known for his autobiography, Papillon, published in 1969, which depicts his imprisonment and numerous escapes from the French penal colony of French Guiana in South America. The book was later adapted into a movie in 1973 starring Steve McQueen as Charrière and Dustin Hoffman as his fellow prisoner, Louis Dega. However, some have questioned the veracity of Charrière's story, claiming that he exaggerated or even fabricated many of the events described in Papillon. Despite the controversy, the book and movie remain popular and have become iconic representations of the brutal conditions of French penal colonies in the early 20th century. In addition to Papillon, Charrière wrote several other books, including Banco: The Further Adventures of Papillon, which also chronicled his experiences after fleeing French Guiana.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of head and neck cancer.
