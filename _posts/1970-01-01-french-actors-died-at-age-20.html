							Pierre Blaise's acting career was relatively brief, but he made a significant impact with his performances. He is best known for his lead role in the controversial film "Lacombe, Lucien" directed by Louis Malle, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 1974 to critical acclaim. Blaise's naturalistic and nuanced performance as Lucien, a farmer who joins the Gestapo during World War II, was widely praised for its authenticity and emotional depth. </p><p>Prior to his acting career, Blaise worked as a farmer and mechanic and had no formal training as an actor. He was discovered by Louis Malle while working on a farm near Moissac. Malle was struck by Blaise's raw talent and cast him in "Lacombe, Lucien" despite his lack of experience. After the success of the film, Blaise began working on his next project, "Les Enfants Terribles," but tragically died in a car accident before filming was completed. He was only 20 years old at the time of his death. Despite his short career, Pierre Blaise remains a celebrated talent and is remembered by many as a promising young actor who left a significant mark on French cinema in the 1970s.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=4533720" title="Wikipedia article about Pierre Blaise">Pierre Blaise on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/russian-actors-died-at-age-67.html' title='Russian actors died at age 67'><strong>Russian actors died at age 67</strong> List of the top 1 Russian actors who died when they were 67</a></li><li><a href='/norwegian-musicians-died-at-age-44.html' title='Norwegian musicians died at age 44'><strong>Norwegian musicians died at age 44</strong> List of the top 3 Norwegian music stars who died when they were 44</a></li><li><a href='/hungarian-actors-died-in-2003.html' title='Hungarian actors died in 2003'><strong>Hungarian actors died in 2003</strong> List of the top 1 Hungarian actors who died in 2003</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-animal-attack.html' title='American actors died in Animal attack'><strong>American actors died in Animal attack</strong> List of the top 1 American actors who died in Animal attack</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-actresses-died-in-1984.html' title='Canadian actresses died in 1984'><strong>Canadian actresses died in 1984</strong> List of the top 3 Canadian actresses who died in 1984</a></li><li><a href='/french-actresses-died-in-2011.html' title='French actresses died in 2011'><strong>French actresses died in 2011</strong> List of the top 11 French actresses who died in 2011</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
