(July 19, 1900		Berlin-December 14, 1958			Munich)

	
		otherwise known as L. Bruhne or Brühne, Lothar

	
was
a West German
film score composer.


					</p><p>He began his career as a composer in the 1920s and worked on various films, including "Die Waise von Lowood" and "Die Freiheit des Adlers." In the 1930s, he worked on several propaganda films during the Nazi regime, including "Hitlerjunge Quex" and "Jud Süß," for which he was later criticized.</p><p>After World War II, Brühne continued to compose music for films, including "Liebe 47" and "Der Verlorene." He was also a respected teacher of composition, and his students included composers like Klaus Huber and Enjott Schneider.</p><p>Brühne's musical style was heavily influenced by classical music, and he often incorporated elements of Romanticism into his work. Despite his involvement in Nazi propaganda films, he is remembered as an important composer and educator in postwar Germany.</p><p>In addition to his film compositions, Brühne also wrote pieces for orchestra, chamber ensembles and solo instruments. He was particularly interested in the use of atonality and serialism, which he studied with Arnold Schoenberg. Brühne's interest in modernist composition techniques is evident in his compositions, such as his "Kammermusik Nr. 2," which was premiered in 1930 and written for a chamber ensemble using serialist techniques.</p><p>Brühne's career was interrupted during World War II, when he was drafted into the German army. After the war, he was briefly imprisoned by the Allies but was eventually released due to a lack of evidence of Nazi sympathies. He resumed his career in the 1950s, and his music remained popular in Germany until his death.</p><p>Despite his controversial past, Brühne's contributions to music were significant, both as a composer and teacher. His students remembered him as a dedicated and passionate teacher, who encouraged experimentation and innovation in their work. Today, he is recognized as one of the most important composers of his generation in Germany.</p><p>Brühne's legacy continues to be discussed and debated due to his involvement in Nazi propaganda films. While he was never officially charged with any wrongdoing, his work for the Nazi regime remains a source of controversy. Some argue that his music should not be celebrated due to its association with propaganda, while others believe that his postwar contributions to music and education should be recognized and celebrated.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his career, Brühne's music has been critically acclaimed. His use of atonality and serialism, as well as his incorporation of Romanticism into his works, has been appreciated by music scholars and enthusiasts alike. His contributions to film score composition, in particular, have influenced many modern composers.</p><p>Brühne's works have been performed and recorded by numerous orchestras and ensembles, including the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra and the Berlin Chamber Choir. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of composers in Germany and beyond.</p><p>In addition to his film score compositions and teaching career, Lothar Brühne was also an accomplished pianist. He studied piano with Edwin Fischer and gave numerous recitals throughout Germany in the 1920s and 1930s. He also recorded several piano works, including pieces by Schumann and Chopin, which were released on the Deutsche Grammophon label. </p><p>Brühne was an active member of the German Composers Union, which he joined in 1926. He also participated in the International Society for Contemporary Music, attending their conferences in Rome and Salzburg. Brühne's interest in contemporary music led him to experiment with new compositional techniques, and he was known for his use of dissonance and unconventional harmonies.</p><p>Despite his controversial past, Brühne remained committed to his artistic pursuits until his untimely death in 1958, due to a heart attack. He was posthumously awarded the Culture Prize of the City of Munich in 1963, which recognized his contributions to music composition and education. </p><p>Today, Brühne's music and legacy continue to be relevant to discussions about the role of art and artists in times of political upheaval. His story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of art being co-opted for political purposes, but also as a testament to the enduring power of music to inspire, challenge, and move audiences.</p><p></p><p>
