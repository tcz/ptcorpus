					</p><p>Alfred Shout was a highly decorated soldier who fought in both the Second Boer War and World War I. He started his military career as a private in the 3rd New Zealand Contingent during the Second Boer War, where he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his bravery in battle.</p><p>After the war, Shout joined the South African Army and was posted to German South-West Africa (now Namibia) where he served as a scout. He quickly rose through the ranks and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1908. He was later promoted to captain in 1913.</p><p>When World War I broke out, Shout was sent to German East Africa (now Tanzania) where he served under Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck in the East African Campaign. He was later sent to Gallipoli as part of the 2nd South African Infantry Regiment, where he was wounded in action and died from his injuries.</p><p>Despite his short life, Shout was remembered as a brave and dedicated soldier who served his country with distinction. To honor his memory, a mountain in Tanzania was named after him, as well as a street in the town of Malmesbury, South Africa, where he grew up.</p><p>Shout was born in Wellington, South Africa, in 1882, and spent his childhood in Malmesbury. After completing his education, he worked as a clerk before enlisting in the army. He was known for his physical prowess and marksmanship, which made him an ideal candidate for military service.</p><p>During his time in German South-West Africa, Shout gained a reputation as a skilled and daring scout. He was commended for his bravery on several occasions and was ultimately awarded the Military Cross for his actions in the field.</p><p>Shout's service in the East African Campaign was no less impressive. He participated in several major battles and played a vital role in coordinating troops and supplies in the difficult terrain of the African bush. His efforts earned him a promotion to major and the respect of his fellow soldiers.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Shout's life was tragically cut short at the age of 33.

Today, his legacy lives on through monuments, streets, and other tributes around the world.</p><p>Shout's bravery and leadership have been the subject of numerous books and articles, and he is still regarded as a hero in South Africa and New Zealand. In addition to the honors he received during his lifetime, Shout was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for bravery in the British and Commonwealth armed forces.</p><p>Shout's Victoria Cross citation reads:</p><p>"For most conspicuous bravery at Lone Pine trenches, in the Gallipoli Peninsula, on the 9th August, 1915. Captain Shout, seeing that the Australians had been driven back to their original trench except for a small portion of the trench to the south-east, and that a strong Turkish force, with bombers, was pressing them hard and enfiladed them from the southward, realized that unless something was done and done at once the Australians would be driven off the plateau, and the position rendered entirely untenable. He accordingly collected a small party of men and led them with the greatest determination against the Turks. There were in the trench at the time only Captain Shout and Lieutenant H. C. Bolden and about six or eight men. The enemy bombing was incessant, but Captain Shout led his party along the trench against the bomb-throwers, and himself bombed and bayonetted the enemy till he cleared them out, and finally succeeded in consolidating the position.</p><p>Captain Shout showed conspicuous bravery and great ability, and saved a very dangerous situation."</p><p>This citation highlights the incredible courage and audacity of Captain Alfred Shout, who risked his life to save his fellow soldiers and ensure the success of his mission. He remains an inspiration to soldiers and civilians alike, a testament to the bravery and selflessness of those who serve their country.</p><p>Alfred Shout's heroism was recognized not just through military honors, but also through literary works. He was mentioned in the book "The Big Game of Africa" by Percy Fitzpatrick, the author of "Jock of the Bushveld". Fitzpatrick called Shout "one of the most exceptional men it has been my good fortune to meet, while the Victoria Cross he won later fully justified my estimate of his character." In addition, Shout was also featured in a poem by Sir Henry Newbolt called "The Vigil", which honors the bravery of soldiers who lost their lives in the World War I. Alfred Shout's legacy continues to inspire present-day soldiers to uphold and emulate his selflessness and dedication to serving their country.</p><p></p><p>
