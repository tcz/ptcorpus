		also known as Yangming Wang

	
was
a Chinese
philosopher.


					</p><p>He was one of the leading thinkers of the Ming dynasty and is regarded as one of the most influential Confucian philosophers in Chinese history. Wang Yangming believed in the importance of intuitive knowledge, which he referred to as "innate knowing" or "knowledge of the heart." He emphasized the role of individual consciousness and argued that knowledge comes from within rather than from external sources. In addition to his philosophical work, Wang Yangming also served as a military general and government official. He was known for his integrity and commitment to social justice, and his teachings continue to be studied and debated in China and around the world.</p><p>Wang Yangming's philosophical ideas were based on Confucianism, but he also incorporated ideas from Taoism and Buddhism into his work. He believed that morality could not be taught, but rather had to be discovered within oneself through self-reflection and introspection. This approach was in contrast to the traditional Confucian emphasis on external rules and rituals.</p><p>Wang Yangming's military career began during the Ming dynasty's wars against the Mongols. He was appointed commander of the forces defending the city of Nanjing and later became the governor of the region. As a government official, he implemented policies to promote education and improve social welfare. He also advocated for the rights of common people and criticized corrupt officials.</p><p>After his death, Wang Yangming's philosophy was at times criticized and suppressed in China, but it continued to have a significant impact on Chinese intellectual history. His ideas influenced the development of Neo-Confucianism and were later embraced by Chinese reformers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, Wang Yangming is celebrated as one of China's greatest thinkers and his ideas continue to be studied and revisited by philosophers and scholars around the world.</p><p></p><p>
