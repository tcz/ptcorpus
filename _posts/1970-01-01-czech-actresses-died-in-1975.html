		a.k.a. Marie Blažková or M. Blazková

	
was
a Czech
actor and writer.



						</p><p>She studied at the Prague Conservatory and later joined the National Theatre in Prague, where she performed in numerous productions. Blazková was also a prolific writer, publishing several plays and novels throughout her career. She was known for her roles in classical Czech literature, as well as for her work in experimental theatre. In addition to her acting and writing, Blazková was actively involved in politics and was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Her outspoken views often led to controversy, and she was briefly jailed during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II. Despite these challenges, Blazková continued to work in the theatre until her retirement in 1965. She died in Svojšice in 1975, and her contributions to Czech theatre and literature continue to be celebrated today.</p><p>Blazková was a trailblazer for women in the Czech theatre world, as one of the first female actors to perform in pants roles. She was also an advocate for promoting women's rights and gender equality. As a writer, she often incorporated feminist themes into her works, which was uncommon at the time. Blazková's most famous play, "The Tongue" ("Jazyk"), stirred controversy for its portrayal of sexual and political themes, and was banned by the government in the late 1920s. Despite this, Blazková continued to write and produce work throughout her career, and is now considered a pioneering figure in Czech theatre and literature. In addition to her artistic contributions, Blazková was a devoted mother to her two children and a mentor to younger actors and writers.</p><p>Blazková's legacy extends beyond her work in the arts and politics. She was a prominent figure in the Czechoslovakian resistance during World War II, using her position in the theatre to aid the resistance movement. Blazková and her husband, fellow actor Jan Pivec, used their connections to provide shelter for resistance fighters and helped transport weapons and supplies. In recognition of her bravery and contributions to the resistance, Blazková was awarded the Order of the Czechoslovak War Cross by the Czechoslovak government-in-exile in 1943.</p><p>Blazková's impact on Czech theatre continues to be felt today. Her feminist themes and pioneering portrayals of gender and sexuality helped pave the way for other artists to explore similar subjects. As an actor, she was renowned for her versatility and ability to inhabit a wide range of characters. Blazková was especially admired for her performances in the plays of Anton Chekhov and William Shakespeare.</p><p>In addition to her artistic and political accomplishments, Blazková was a devoted wife and mother. She and her husband Jan Pivec had two children, both of whom went on to become respected actors in their own right. Blazková maintained close relationships with her colleagues and mentored many younger actors and writers throughout her career. Her legacy remains an inspiration to those who cherish freedom of expression and gender equality in the arts.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/bulgarian-actresses-died-in-2002.html' title='Bulgarian actresses died in 2002'><strong>Bulgarian actresses died in 2002</strong> List of the top 1 Bulgarian actresses who died in 2002</a></li><li><a href='/south-african-actresses-died-in-cancer.html' title='South African actresses died in Cancer'><strong>South African actresses died in Cancer</strong> List of the top 2 South African actresses who died in Cancer</a></li><li><a href='/brazilian-actresses-died-in-emphysema.html' title='Brazilian actresses died in Emphysema'><strong>Brazilian actresses died in Emphysema</strong> List of the top 1 Brazilian actresses who died in Emphysema</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/argentine-actresses-died-in-2007.html' title='Argentine actresses died in 2007'><strong>Argentine actresses died in 2007</strong> List of the top 5 Argentine actresses who died in 2007</a></li><li><a href='/spanish-actresses-died-at-age-68.html' title='Spanish actresses died at age 68'><strong>Spanish actresses died at age 68</strong> List of the top 1 Spanish actresses who died when they were 68</a></li><li><a href='/spanish-actors-died-in-1992.html' title='Spanish actors died in 1992'><strong>Spanish actors died in 1992</strong> List of the top 6 Spanish actors who died in 1992</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
