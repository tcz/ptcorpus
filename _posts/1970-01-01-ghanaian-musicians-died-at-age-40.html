					</p><p>He played a significant role in the military coup that ousted Ghana's first President, Kwame Nkrumah in 1966. Kotoka was a member of the National Liberation Council, which appointed him as the chairman of the ruling military government. Before the coup, he was the commander of the Ghanaian Army's First Infantry Brigade, and in that role, he led a successful operation against the separatist movement in the Western Togoland area.
