He traveled extensively throughout his career, visiting countries such as the United States, Mexico and Congo, which inspired him to create diverse and colorful settings for his comics.</p><p>In the late 1950s, Jijé converted to Catholicism and began to explore religious themes in his work. He created several religious comics, including "Blaise le savetier" and "Le jeune Albert". He also collaborated with the French publisher Fleurus on a series of educational comics for children.</p><p>Despite his later focus on religious comics, Jijé's legacy as one of the pioneers of Franco-Belgian comics remains strong. His influence can be seen in the work of contemporary artists such as Joann Sfar and Emmanuel Lepage.

He also worked as a teacher and mentor, inspiring a generation of Belgian film-makers to experiment with avant-garde techniques.</p><p>Dekeukeleire's legacy endures through the annual Charles Dekeukeleire Prize, which is awarded every year to a promising young Belgian film-maker.
