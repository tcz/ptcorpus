was
a British
poet.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the most important poets of the First World War. Before the war, Thomas had published extensively as a literary critic and biographer. However, it wasn't until he met the American poet Robert Frost in 1913 that he began to write his own poetry. Frost encouraged Thomas to focus on the English countryside and rural life, which became a recurring theme in his work. Despite only writing poetry for a few short years, Thomas is known for his ability to evoke a sense of place and his use of subtle language to explore complex emotions. Thomas was killed in France during the Battle of Arras in 1917, just a few months after he had enlisted in the army.</p><p></p><p>
