was
a French
novelist, poet, actor and film director.


					</p><p>Born in Switzerland, Cendrars grew up in a multilingual environment, speaking Swiss German, French, and Russian. He traveled extensively throughout his life, which in turn influenced his writings. In World War I, Cendrars lost his right arm in battle, an event that deeply impacted his literary work. He is considered a pioneer of Modernist literature and his works often explore the themes of travel, adventure, and the human condition.</p><p>Cendrars wrote in a variety of genres including poetry, novels, and memoirs.

He later served in the French Foreign Legion, traveling to locations such as Brazil and Africa. Cendrars' love for travel was insatiable, and he visited places such as New York and Paris, which became his home base, during his lifetime. </p><p>Despite his extensive travels and engagement in a myriad of professions, writing remained his greatest passion. Cendrars' work, which was characterized by his unorthodox style, incorporated surrealism, metaphors and stream-of-consciousness techniques.

(October 20, 1889		Blainville-Crevon-September 11, 1963			Paris)

	
		a.k.a. Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti

	
was
a French
painter.


					</p><p>She was the sister of the more famous artists Marcel Duchamp and Raymond Duchamp-Villon, and wife of the artist Jean Crotti. Suzanne Duchamp worked in a variety of styles, from impressionism to surrealism. Her early works were primarily landscapes and still life paintings, but she later moved towards more abstract compositions. Duchamp was an active member of the Parisian art scene and exhibited her work at a number of important exhibitions, including the Salon des Indépendants and the Salon d'Automne. Despite her talent as an artist, Duchamp is often overshadowed by her more famous brothers, and her contributions to the development of modern art are often overlooked. However, recent scholarship has begun to reassess her work and place her in the context of the avant-garde movements of the early 20th century.</p><p>One of Duchamp's most famous works is a collaborative piece she created with her husband, Jean Crotti, and her brothers Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia, called "The Blind Man's Ball" (Le Bal Masqué des Aveugles). This work was an important piece of the Dada movement and was shown at the Galerie de l'Effort Moderne in 1920.</p><p>Later in her career, Duchamp became more interested in the surreal aspects of art and began incorporating elements of fantasy and dreams into her work. Her painting "Jeune Fille Cachee" (Hidden Young Girl) is a prime example of her surreal style. Despite the fact that her work was well-received by critics and fellow artists during her lifetime, she was often relegated to a supporting role in the history of modern art due to the overshadowing fame of her brothers.</p><p>Nevertheless, Duchamp's work has continued to gain recognition in recent years, and she has been the subject of several exhibitions and studies. Her contributions to the development of modern art are now being more fully appreciated, and her complex artistic legacy is being reevaluated in the light of new scholarship.</p><p></p><p>

(August 10, 1924		Versailles-April 21, 1998			Paris)

	
		also known as Jean-Francois Lyotard, Jean Lyotard or Jean-François Lyotard

	
was
a French
philosopher.


					</p><p>Lyotard was best known for his work on postmodernism, where he argued that there is a fragmentation of knowledge with no metanarrative to tie together different traditions of thought. He was also an important philosopher of language, art, and politics. Lyotard's most famous work, "The Postmodern Condition", examined how changes in communication technology and knowledge production have led to a transformation in the way knowledge is understood and communicated. He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Paris and at the University of California, Irvine. In addition to philosophy, Lyotard also wrote on art and was a curator of art exhibitions, including the groundbreaking exhibition "Les Immatériaux" at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.</p><p>Lyotard's early education was marked with tragedy as his mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer when he was only 15 years old, and she passed away when he was 18. His academic career started at the Sorbonne, where he studied literature and philosophy, and then he went on to complete his doctoral thesis in philosophy at the Sorbonne-Nouvelle in Paris. During his time in Paris he also worked as a teacher and a cultural activist, writing for "Socialisme ou Barbarie," a Marxist journal. He was deeply influenced by the events of May 1968, which he saw as a challenge to existing power structures and a call for a new kind of politics. Lyotard's work challenged the idea of the grand narrative, particularly the idea of reason, science, and historical progress, which he saw as exclusionary and oppressive. Instead, he called for a politics of difference that would recognize the diversity of human experience and knowledge. His ideas were hugely influential in the fields of philosophy and art, and continue to be studied and debated today.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of leukemia.

		otherwise known as Jean Dominique Antony Metzinger

	
was
a French
painter, writer, poet and critic.


					</p><p>He played an important role in the development of Cubism, a revolutionary art movement of the early 20th century that challenged traditional representation in art. Metzinger was closely associated with other prominent Cubist artists such as Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso. He had a notable career as an art critic, penning influential essays on the theory and practice of Cubism. Metzinger's own paintings were typically characterized by fragmented, geometric forms and an interest in the multiple viewpoints of a subject. He exhibited his work widely throughout Europe and the United States, and his art can be found in many of the world's major museums.</p><p>Metzinger was born into an artistic family and grew up in a creative environment. After studying art in Paris, he began to experiment with divisionist techniques, which involved breaking up colors into their component parts in order to create a more vibrant and dynamic canvas. He later developed these ideas further in his Cubist work, which used fragmented forms and multiple viewpoints to create a sense of movement and depth.</p><p>Metzinger was also a prolific writer and thinker. He contributed articles to several avant-garde publications, including "Les Soirées de Paris" and "La Section D'Or," and published a book on Cubism in 1912. In his writing, he advocated for a new kind of art that would break free from traditional representational techniques and embrace abstraction and conceptualism.</p><p>Despite his significant contributions to the Cubist movement, Metzinger's work fell out of favor in the years following World War I. He continued to work and exhibit throughout his life, but he struggled to regain the recognition and influence that he had enjoyed in the early years of his career. Today, however, his contributions to the development of modern art are widely recognized, and his work is celebrated in major museums and galleries around the world.</p><p></p><p>
