Burckhard later continued his musical career with several other bands, including The I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness and The Numb Ones. He currently lives in Texas and continues to make music.</p><p>After leaving Nirvana, Aaron Burckhard became involved in the punk rock scene in the Pacific Northwest, drumming for several local bands. In the early 2000s, he moved to Austin, Texas, where he played with The Numb Ones, a punk rock group that gained a following in the city's vibrant music scene. Burckhard eventually shifted his focus to indie rock and alternative music, becoming the drummer for The I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness, a band known for its moody, atmospheric sound. He contributed to the group's critically acclaimed 2006 album, "Fear is on Our Side," which helped to establish them as one of the most promising acts in indie rock.
