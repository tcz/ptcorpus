Burckhard later continued his musical career with several other bands, including The I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness and The Numb Ones. He currently lives in Texas and continues to make music.</p><p>After leaving Nirvana, Aaron Burckhard became involved in the punk rock scene in the Pacific Northwest, drumming for several local bands. In the early 2000s, he moved to Austin, Texas, where he played with The Numb Ones, a punk rock group that gained a following in the city's vibrant music scene.
