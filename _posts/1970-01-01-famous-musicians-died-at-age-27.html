Laforgue's writing was characterized by his use of irony, humor, and pessimism, and he was known for his wit and satirical edge.

His innovative style and use of irony and satire influenced many later writers, including T.S. Eliot, who called Laforgue a "pioneer of modern poetry." Laforgue's work also had a significant impact on the development of Symbolism, a literary movement that emphasized the use of symbolism and emphasized the importance of dreams and the unconscious.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Laforgue was also a talented musician and painter. He was friends with many of the leading artists and writers of his time, including Paul Verlaine, Stéphane Mallarmé, and Oscar Wilde.
