							Albert Mol was a multifaceted personality who not only excelled in acting but was also a popular television presenter, writer, and singer. He was trained as an actor at the Toneelschool Amsterdam, and following his graduation, he joined the Nederlandse Comedie, one of the foremost Dutch theatre companies of the time. </p><p>Mol rose to fame with his stage performances in several plays, including 'Othello,' 'King Lear,' and 'The Importance of Being Earnest.' Later, he transitioned to the small screen and became a well-known television host, presenting several shows such as 'Wie van de Drie' and 'Zo is het toevallig ook nog eens een keer.' </p><p>Apart from his successful career in entertainment, Mol was also openly gay and a vocal LGBT rights activist. He wrote a book about his experiences in the closet and coming out called 'Gijzelaar' (Hostage) and even recorded a song called 'The Laughing Policeman,' which humorously mocked the Dutch police's obsession with arresting homosexuals. </p><p>In recognition of his contributions to Dutch culture, Mol was awarded several honours during his lifetime, including the Silver medal of the City of Amsterdam and the Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau. He remained active in the entertainment industry until the last years of his life, performing on stage until shortly before his death in March 2004.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=528288" title="Wikipedia article about Albert Mol">Albert Mol on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/austrian-actresses-died-in-2014.html' title='Austrian actresses died in 2014'><strong>Austrian actresses died in 2014</strong> List of the top 4 Austrian actresses who died in 2014</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-at-age-50.html' title='Famous musicians died at age 50'><strong>Famous musicians died at age 50</strong> List of the top 9 Famous music stars who died when they were 50</a></li><li><a href='/estonian-actors-died-in-1985.html' title='Estonian actors died in 1985'><strong>Estonian actors died in 1985</strong> List of the top 1 Estonian actors who died in 1985</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-accident.html' title='American actors died in Accident'><strong>American actors died in Accident</strong> List of the top 7 American actors who died in Accident</a></li><li><a href='/french-actors-died-in-colorectal-cancer.html' title='French actors died in Colorectal cancer'><strong>French actors died in Colorectal cancer</strong> List of the top 1 French actors who died in Colorectal cancer</a></li><li><a href='/swiss-actresses-died-in-1999.html' title='Swiss actresses died in 1999'><strong>Swiss actresses died in 1999</strong> List of the top 1 Swiss actresses who died in 1999</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
