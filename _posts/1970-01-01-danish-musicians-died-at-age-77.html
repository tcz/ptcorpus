(October 7, 1885		Copenhagen-November 18, 1962			Copenhagen)

	
		a.k.a. Niels Bohr

	
was
a Danish
physicist and scientist.


					
			
		His children
		are
		called
		Aage Bohr, Erik Bohr, Ernest Bohr, Hans Henrik Bohr, Christian Bohr and Harald Bohr.

						</p><p>Niels Bohr made significant contributions to the development of atomic theory and quantum mechanics. He is widely recognized for proposing the Bohr Model, which depicts the atom as a small positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons in circular orbits. His model offered a theoretical explanation for why the electrons do not spiral into the nucleus under classical physics laws of electromagnetism.</p><p>Bohr was also an instrumental figure in the Manhattan Project, during which he worked on the development of the first atomic bomb. Throughout his lifetime, he received numerous honors and awards, including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922 for his work on the structure of atoms and the radiation they emit.</p><p>In addition to his scientific pursuits, Bohr was also an advocate for international cooperation and peace. He played a significant role in establishing the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1945, serving as the first chairman of its Atomic Energy Commission.</p><p>Today, Bohr's legacy lives on through the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, which he founded and which continues to be a leading research center in the fields of physics and astronomy.</p><p>Bohr came from a family of prominent scientists, with his father being Christian Bohr, a renowned physiologist, and his brother being Harald Bohr, a mathematician. He initially pursued a career in physics and earned his Ph.D. from the University of Copenhagen in 1911, after which he spent time studying under J.J. Thomson at the University of Cambridge.</p><p>In addition to his work on atomic theory, Bohr was also a pioneer in the field of quantum mechanics. He worked on developing the Copenhagen interpretation, which provided a philosophical framework for understanding the behavior of subatomic particles. Bohr's ideas and theories have been essential to the development of modern physics.</p><p>Bohr was a prolific thinker and communicator, with a keen interest in the philosophy of science. He engaged in intellectual debates with other leading scientists of his time, including Albert Einstein, and tackled topics such as the nature of reality, the role of the observer in quantum mechanics, and the limitations of scientific knowledge.</p><p>Bohr's scientific and philosophical contributions have had a lasting impact on both the scientific community and society as a whole. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential physicists of the 20th century, and his work continues to inspire new generations of scientists and thinkers.</p><p>Bohr's contributions to the development of atomic theory and quantum mechanics were not limited to the Bohr Model. In 1927, he proposed the principle of complementarity, which states that two seemingly contradictory perspectives can be simultaneously true. This principle became a cornerstone of quantum theory and influenced the thinking of many scientists and philosophers.Bohr was also instrumental in the establishment of the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen, which attracted many leading physicists of the time. He encouraged collaboration and intellectual exchange among scientists from different countries, and his institute played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.Bohr's humanitarian efforts were also notable. He spoke out against the use of nuclear weapons and became a vocal advocate for international disarmament. He received numerous awards and honors throughout his lifetime, including the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Franklin Medal, and the Order of the Elephant, Denmark's highest honor.Bohr's legacy continues to shape the field of physics and inspire new generations of scientists. His contributions to atomic theory, quantum mechanics, and international cooperation have had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and our place in it.</p><p>Bohr was known for his collaborative approach to scientific research, often working closely with other scientists to develop and refine his ideas. He established strong relationships with many leading physicists of the time, including Werner Heisenberg and Wolfgang Pauli, and his influence can be seen in the work of numerous other scientists who followed in his footsteps. Bohr also mentored many young physicists who went on to have successful careers in their own right.</p><p>Beyond his scientific achievements, Bohr was also a deeply philosophical thinker who grappled with some of the most profound questions of human existence. He was deeply committed to the idea that science could help us better understand our place in the universe and our relationship to the natural world.</p><p>Throughout his life, Bohr remained a tireless advocate for international cooperation and scientific advancement. He recognized that the challenges facing the world could only be solved through collaborative effort, and he worked tirelessly to promote dialogue and understanding between scientists from different countries and backgrounds.</p><p>Today, Bohr is remembered as one of the most important scientists of the 20th century, and his contributions continue to shape the field of physics and inspire new generations of scientists and thinkers. His legacy is a testament to the power of human curiosity, and a reminder of the importance of pursuing knowledge and understanding in order to make the world a better place for all.</p><p></p><p>

a Danish
film director and actor.


					</p><p>He was known for his work during the silent film era and is considered one of Denmark's most important early filmmakers. Blom began his career as an actor in the theater, but transitioned to film directing in 1909. He directed over 100 films during his career and was particularly known for his historical dramas, which were often shot on location in Denmark and featured large casts. In addition to his work in Denmark, Blom also made films in Germany and Sweden. His most famous film is likely his 1913 production of Atlantis, a lavish and expensive historical drama that became a major international success. Blom continued to make films until the early 1930s, after which he retired from filmmaking. He died in his native Copenhagen at the age of 77.</p><p>Blom was born into a family of artists, his mother being an opera singer and his father a painter. Blom's siblings also pursued creative careers, with his brother being a sculptor and his sister a writer. Blom's background in theater may have contributed to his success in film directing, as he was skilled in staging and working with actors. In addition to his work on screen, Blom also wrote and produced some of his films. Despite his success during his lifetime, many of Blom's films were lost or destroyed over time, leaving only a small fraction of his work available today. Nevertheless, his contributions to early cinema in Denmark and beyond are widely recognized and appreciated by film historians and enthusiasts.</p><p>Blom's impact on Danish cinema went beyond his prolific filmmaking career. He was also instrumental in the formation of Den Danske Filmskole, the Danish Film School, which he helped found in 1926.

He was a vocal advocate for the arts and culture during his time in office, and his political and artistic interests were intertwined throughout his life.</p><p>Blom's legacy in Danish cinema continues to be celebrated today, with retrospectives and restorations of his surviving films. In 2014, the Danish Film Institute published a book about Blom's life and work, featuring contributions from filmmakers, historians, and archivists. The book highlights his importance not only to Danish cinema, but also to the development of early cinema as a whole.</p><p>Blom's influence on early cinema can also be seen in his use of innovative techniques and technologies. He was one of the first filmmakers to experiment with special effects, using techniques such as double exposure and matte painting to create fantastical and otherworldly visuals on screen. He also utilized new devices such as the cranking camera, which allowed for smoother movement and greater control in filming action sequences. Blom's technical innovations contributed to the advancement of filmmaking as an art form and helped pave the way for future generations of filmmakers.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Blom remained humble and devoted to his craft throughout his life. He once said, "A director's job is not only to direct, but also to be a teacher. Above all, a director must have sensitivity and sympathy for his actors, and be able to share in their emotions." This philosophy is evident in the compelling performances he was able to elicit from his cast, as well as in the enduring impact of his films on audiences around the world.</p><p></p><p>

					</p><p>Karen Blixen is best known for her memoir book "Out of Africa" that narrates her life as a coffee plantation owner in Kenya between 1914-1931. Her works are known for their delicate prose and poetic vision on the relationships between men and women, society and the natural world. Some of her other notable works include "Seven Gothic Tales," "Winter's Tales," and "Last Tales." Blixen's writing has influenced many contemporary writers, including Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Jhumpa Lahiri. Despite her literary success, Blixen suffered from financial troubles throughout her life and had to sell her Kenyan farm after a series of crop failures.</p><p>Blixen was born into an aristocratic family in Denmark and grew up on her family's estate, which influenced her later works. She married her second cousin, Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke, in 1914 and moved with him to Kenya to start a coffee plantation. However, their marriage was troubled and they eventually divorced. Blixen remained in Kenya for another 17 years, running the plantation and developing a deep connection to the country and its people. </p><p>In addition to her writing, Blixen was also an artist and photographed the land and people around her. Her works were later published in a book titled "Africa, I Love You." Blixen's life and work were the subject of the 1985 film "Out of Africa," which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. </p><p>Blixen's legacy continues to inspire writers and readers alike. She was a trailblazer for female writers and her unique perspective on colonialism and humanity still resonates with audiences today. Her home in Kenya, which has been turned into a museum, is a popular tourist attraction and her grave in Denmark is visited by fans from around the world.</p><p>Blixen's literary career started when she was still a child, as she began writing stories and plays while still a student. She continued to write throughout her life and her works were published in various magazines and literary journals. Blixen's style has been described as a mixture of romanticism and realism, as she often infused her stories with elements of fantasy and imaginative imagery. Her use of language was also highly praised, with many critics noting the lyrical quality of her prose.</p><p>In addition to her literary and artistic pursuits, Blixen was also actively involved in the Kenyan community. She provided medical care and education for the workers on her plantation and was a vocal advocate for their rights. Blixen's humanitarian efforts extended beyond her own plantation, as she helped to establish a maternity hospital and a school for African children.</p><p>Despite her impact on the literary world, Blixen was often overlooked in her own time. It wasn't until after her death that her works gained widespread recognition, with many of her stories and novels being translated into multiple languages. Today, Blixen is celebrated as one of the most important writers of the 20th century and her legacy continues to inspire generations of readers and writers.</p><p>Karen Blixen's life was full of adventures, including travels to different parts of the world. She journeyed to Egypt, where she learned Arabic and immersed herself in the culture. Later in life, she also traveled to the United States and met with writers such as Truman Capote and Carson McCullers. Blixen was a prolific writer, and her works continue to be studied and analyzed by literary scholars around the world. Her writing style was distinctive and often drew from the places she visited and the people she encountered during her travels.

In collaboration with his son, Kaare Klint, he designed several pieces of furniture that were inspired by traditional Danish designs. The most famous of these was the Faaborg Chair, which was created for the Faaborg Museum. The chair is characterized by its simple, clean lines and functional design, and it is considered to be one of the most iconic pieces of Danish furniture.</p><p>Jensen-Klint was also interested in urban planning and housing design, and he believed that good design could improve people's quality of life. He designed several housing projects that were intended to provide affordable, high-quality housing for working-class families.
