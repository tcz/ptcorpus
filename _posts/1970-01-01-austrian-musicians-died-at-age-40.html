(November 30, 1874		Vienna-October 7, 1915			Folgaria)

	
		also known as Friedrich Hasenohrl

	
was
an Austrian
physicist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work in the field of electromagnetic theory, where he made significant contributions to the development of the theory of thermal radiation. Hasenöhrl's most famous paper, published in 1900, proposed the concept of the spectral energy density of blackbody radiation. His work laid the foundations for the later development of quantum mechanics and the modern understanding of blackbody radiation. Hasenöhrl was also a professor of physics at the University of Vienna and played a key role in the founding of the Austrian Physical Society. Tragically, he was killed in action during World War I while serving in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Despite his short life, Hasenöhrl's contributions to the field of physics remain highly regarded and his work continues to be studied and referenced by scientists today.</p><p>In addition to his scientific contributions, Hasenöhrl was a skilled musician and had a deep appreciation for the arts. He was known for his love of opera and often attended performances in his free time. Hasenöhrl was also a prolific writer and published many papers on a variety of topics throughout his career. He received several awards and honors in recognition of his contributions to physics, including the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art. Today, the Friedrich Hasenöhrl Prize is awarded annually by the Austrian Physical Society to young physicists in recognition of their outstanding contributions to their field. Hasenöhrl's legacy as a pioneering physicist and a well-rounded scholar continues to inspire future generations of scientists and intellectuals.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and cultural contributions, Friedrich Hasenöhrl also had a personal life. Hasenöhrl got married to Charmian Wright, a British lady, in 1906 when he visited England to deliver lectures on thermodynamics. They had two sons together, but unfortunately, Hasenöhrl's untimely death during World War I left his family in financial difficulties. To help, his colleagues established the Hasenöhrl Relief Fund, which raised money to support his family. Hasenöhrl's legacy still inspires many physicists today, and his contributions to the field of electromagnetism, blackbody radiation, and quantum mechanics continue to be studied in academic circles.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and cultural contributions, Friedrich Hasenöhrl also had a personal life.

He then worked as an assistant to Ludwig Boltzmann and later Hermann Minkowski at the University of Bonn. Hasenöhrl was greatly influenced by Boltzmann's work in thermodynamics, and his early publications focused on that topic. However, it was his work on blackbody radiation that earned him the most recognition in the scientific community. </p><p>Hasenöhrl's contributions to science were not limited to his research. He played an active role in the scientific community, serving as the secretary of the Austrian Physical Society from 1902 to 1905 and again from 1908 to 1915. He was also a member of the editorial board of the popular scientific journal "Zeitschrift für Physik" and contributed numerous articles to the journal. Despite his busy schedule, Hasenöhrl always made time for his family and maintained close relationships with his colleagues and students. </p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Friedrich Hasenöhrl left an indelible mark on the field of physics. His contributions to the understanding of blackbody radiation and the foundations of quantum mechanics are still being studied and built upon today. His legacy as a dedicated scientist, a devoted family man, and a lover of the arts continues to inspire academics and scholars around the world.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Dr. Herbert Silberer

	
was
an Austrian
psychologist and physician.


					</p><p>Silberer is best known for his work on the relationship between alchemy and psychology, which he explored in his book "Problems of Mysticism and its Symbolism". He was also interested in the phenomenon of hypnosis and wrote extensively on the subject. Silberer was a contemporary of Sigmund Freud and was associated with the Vienna School of Psychoanalysis. Despite his contributions to the field of psychology, Silberer remains relatively unknown today.</p><p>Silberer was born into a family of Jewish heritage and studied medicine at the University of Vienna. After receiving his degree, he began practicing medicine but eventually became more interested in psychology. He studied under Carl Gustav Jung in Zurich and became one of the earliest members of the psychoanalytic movement. Silberer became known for his work on the relationship between the conscious and unconscious mind and how this related to alchemy. His book "Problems of Mysticism and its Symbolism" explored these themes and was influential in the field of psychology.</p><p>Silberer was also interested in the phenomenon of hypnosis and wrote extensively on the subject. He believed that hypnosis could be a powerful tool for treating mental illness and spent much of his career exploring its potential. Despite his contributions to the field of psychology, Silberer's work was often overlooked in favor of his contemporaries such as Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.</p><p>Silberer suffered from depression throughout his life and ultimately took his own life in 1923.

He wrote articles for numerous European newspapers, covering topics ranging from healthcare to politics. He was also an accomplished translator, having translated works from various languages into German, including books by Anatole France and H.G. Wells.</p><p>Silberer's interest in alchemy and mysticism can be traced back to his childhood, as he grew up in a household that was steeped in Jewish mysticism. He believed that alchemy provided a metaphorical language for the unconscious, and that by decoding the symbolic language of alchemy, we could gain a deeper understanding of the human psyche.</p><p>Despite his relatively short life and the fact that his work was often overshadowed by his contemporaries, Silberer's ideas continue to have a profound impact on the field of psychology. His emphasis on the relationship between the conscious and unconscious mind, and his exploration of the deeper symbolism behind alchemical texts, have helped to shape modern-day psychoanalytic theory.</p><p>Herbert Silberer's legacy lives on not only in the field of psychology but also in literature, where his writings continue to be influential. His book "Problems of Mysticism and its Symbolism" remains a classic of its kind and has been translated into several languages. Silberer's fascination with alchemy and mysticism has also influenced artists and writers, including the famous Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung, who cited Silberer's work as an inspiration for his own theories on the collective unconscious.Silberer's interest in hypnosis has also had a lasting impact, as many modern psychotherapeutic techniques are based on this principle.

(December 22, 1867		Opava-August 8, 1908			Düsseldorf)


was
an Austrian
architect.


					</p><p>Olbrich was a key figure in the development of the Viennese Secession movement, which aimed to break away from the academic style of traditional art and embrace more modern and avant-garde forms. He was a member of the group from its founding in 1897, and helped design their exhibition building in 1898, which is now the Secession Building in Vienna. He also designed several private villas in Vienna, as well as the Vienna Savings Bank building. In 1899, Olbrich was appointed as the artistic director of the Darmstadt Artists' Colony, where he designed several buildings, including the Wedding Tower and the Ernst-Ludwig House. After leaving the colony in 1907, he moved to Düsseldorf and founded the School of Arts and Crafts there. Olbrich's style was characterized by his use of simple forms, straight lines, and whitewashed facades, and his work is considered a precursor to the modernist movement.</p><p>Olbrich's influence extended beyond architecture to other areas of design. He believed that architecture should be integrated with every aspect of design, including furniture, textiles, and decorative arts. As a result, he opened a collaborative workshop in Vienna known as the Wiener Werkstätte, which brought together architects, designers, and artists to create works that were both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The Wiener Werkstätte produced a range of products, including ceramics, furniture, and jewelry, and became a major force in the Art Nouveau movement.</p><p>In addition to his architectural and design work, Olbrich was also a teacher and writer. He taught at the University of Applied Arts Vienna and wrote several articles on design theory and practice. His writings, along with his work as an architect and designer, helped shape the direction of modernism in Austria and beyond.</p><p>Unfortunately, Olbrich's life was cut short when he died of leukemia at the age of 40. However, his legacy continues to be felt in the world of architecture and design, and his influence can be seen in the work of many modernist architects, including Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.</p><p>Olbrich was born in Opava, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and he studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology. After completing his studies, he worked for several architects in Vienna, including Otto Wagner, who was also a key member of the Viennese Secession movement.</p><p>Olbrich's work was often controversial, and he faced criticism from traditionalists who rejected the radical new forms he was advocating. However, his innovative designs also won him acclaim, and in 1900 he was awarded the Grand Prix at the Paris World's Fair for his work on the Austrian pavilion.</p><p>Olbrich's work had a significant impact on the development of architecture and design in the early 20th century, and his ideas continue to influence contemporary architects and designers today. In recognition of his contributions to the field, the Joseph Maria Olbrich Prize is awarded every two years by the Association of German Architects to an architect who has made significant contributions to the field of architecture.</p><p>Olbrich's commitment to integrating all areas of design is evident in his personal life as well. He designed his own home in Darmstadt, which is now known as the Olbrich House, and it features his signature white facades and simple forms. He also designed much of the interior of the house, including furniture and decorative elements, making it a true example of his belief in a complete and cohesive design aesthetic. The Olbrich House is now a museum and serves as a testament to Olbrich's enduring influence on the world of design. Despite his relatively short career, Olbrich left behind an impressive body of work and a legacy that continues to inspire and influence designers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
