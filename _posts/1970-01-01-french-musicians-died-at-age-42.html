		also known as Eduard Marcus or Alex. Cernat

	
was
a French
writer.


					</p><p>Ilarie Voronca was a Romanian avant-garde poet and essayist who spent much of his adult life in exile in France. He was a member of the Surrealist movement and contributed significantly to its development not only in France but also in Romania. Before moving to France, Voronca studied law and philosophy at universities in Bucharest and Geneva. In addition to his literary pursuits, he also worked as a translator and taught French at various institutions. Voronca's literary works often dealt with themes of death, love, and the subconscious mind. His most celebrated works include the poetry collection “Echinox” and the essay collection “Poetry and Revolution.” Despite his short life, Voronca remains an important figure in Romanian and French literature.</p><p>Voronca's life was marked by tragedy and exile. He left Romania in 1938, after the publication of his poetry collection "Echinox," which was deemed too daring and controversial by the authorities. He settled in Paris, where he continued his writing career and became an active participant in the Surrealist movement. He collaborated with other prominent writers and artists of his time, including Andre Breton, Paul Eluard, and Pablo Picasso.</p><p>Voronca's writings were deeply influenced by his experiences of exile and displacement. He often explored themes of identity, belonging, and isolation, and his work was characterized by an avant-garde approach to language and form. Some of his other notable works include the poetry collection "Les Pas dans le sable" and the play "Adam et Eve."</p><p>Despite his achievements, Voronca struggled with mental illness throughout his life. He suffered from bouts of depression and anxiety, which were exacerbated by his experiences of exile and isolation. In 1946, he took his own life by jumping from a window in his apartment in Paris. He was only 42 years old at the time of his death.</p><p>Today, Voronca is remembered as a pioneering figure of the Romanian and French avant-garde. His work continues to inspire writers and artists around the world, and his legacy is celebrated in both Romania and France.</p><p>Voronca's contributions to the Surrealist movement were notable, particularly in his exploration of dreams and the subconscious. He was known for his use of vivid and surreal imagery in his poetry, which often dealt with themes of love and desire. In addition to his literary pursuits, Voronca was also a talented painter and participated in several group exhibitions in Paris.</p><p>Voronca's legacy was initially overshadowed by the events of World War II and the Communist regime in Romania, which rejected the avant-garde movement as bourgeois and decadent. However, in the post-war years, Voronca's work began to gain more recognition, particularly in France. In 1965, a selection of his poetry was translated into English and published as "Babel's Ark."</p><p>Today, Voronca is regarded as one of the most important avant-garde writers of his generation, and his work has been the subject of numerous critical studies and retrospectives. His influence can be seen in the work of later writers and artists, particularly those interested in exploring the subconscious and the irrational. Despite the tragedy of his early death, Voronca's literary legacy continues to inspire and captivate readers around the world.</p><p>Voronca's impact on both literary and artistic fields extended beyond his lifetime. His poems were set to music by several composers, and in 1988, a selection of his poetry was set to music and performed by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Radio France. In addition to his artistic pursuits, Voronca was also a committed political activist. He was a member of the French Resistance during World War II and was involved in distributing anti-fascist propaganda. His essay collection, "Poetry and Revolution," explored the role of art in political change and called for a reimagining of society rooted in creativity and freedom. Voronca's life and work continue to fascinate scholars and admirers alike, and his legacy remains an important part of both Romanian and French cultural history.</p><p></p><p>

(December 17, 1706		Paris-September 10, 1749			Lunéville)

	
		a.k.a. Emilie du Chatelet or Emilie, Marquise du Chatelet

	
was
a French
physicist, scientist, mathematician and writer.


					
			
		Her child
		is
		
		Louis Marie Florent du Châtelet.

						</p><p>She was educated in mathematics and physics by Maupertuis, and she made important contributions to the understanding of kinetic energy. Du Châtelet also translated Newton's Principia Mathematica into French, which is considered a seminal work on the laws of motion and universal gravitation. In addition to her scientific pursuits, she was also known for her romantic relationships. Du Châtelet was a lover of the philosopher Voltaire, and the two collaborated on many projects. She died in childbirth at the age of 42. Despite her many accomplishments, Du Châtelet's work was largely overlooked for many years due to her gender, but she has since been recognized as a trailblazing scientist and thinker.</p><p>Du Châtelet was born into an aristocratic family and was initially homeschooled in Latin and Italian. At the age of 12, she was married off to the Marquis Florent-Claude du Châtelet, who was 28 years her senior. Despite the arranged marriage, the two had a mostly amicable relationship and even shared a passion for science and literature.</p><p>In addition to her work in physics and mathematics, Du Châtelet was also well-versed in literature and philosophy. She wrote several plays, essays, and treatises on various subjects, including the education of women and the nature of happiness. Her most famous work, "Institutions de Physique" ("Foundations of Physics"), was published in 1740 and became a widely-used textbook.</p><p>Du Châtelet's legacy has been overshadowed by that of her lover, Voltaire, but in recent years, there has been a renewed interest in her contributions to science and philosophy. In 2016, on the 310th anniversary of her birth, Google honored Du Châtelet with a doodle.</p><p>Du Châtelet's interest in mathematics and physics began at a young age, and she studied under some of the leading scholars of her time. She was particularly interested in Newtonian mechanics and spent many years studying and writing about the subject. Her most important contribution to the field was her recognition of the concept of energy and the role it plays in physical systems. </p><p>Du Châtelet's translation of Principia Mathematica was not only important for making Newton's work accessible to French speakers, but it also included her own commentary and annotations. This edition helped to popularize Newtonian mechanics throughout Europe and underscored the importance of scientific inquiry.</p><p>Despite her many accomplishments, Du Châtelet's life was not without its challenges. She struggled with health issues throughout her life, and her relationship with Voltaire was often tumultuous. Nonetheless, her legacy has endured, and she is considered one of the most important female scientists of the 18th century.</p><p>Du Châtelet was not only a pioneering scientist and writer, but she also challenged societal norms and advocated for greater opportunities for women. She believed that women were capable of achieving the same intellectual accomplishments as men and encouraged education for women at all levels. Du Châtelet's feminist views were radical for her time, and she faced criticism and ridicule for holding them. However, her writings on the subject became influential and helped lay the groundwork for the women's rights movement of the following centuries. </p><p>Du Châtelet's personal life was marked by scandal and intrigue. In addition to her relationship with Voltaire, she had affairs with several other men, including the military officer, Jean-Francois de Saint-Lambert. Despite this, she maintained a close friendship with her husband, who supported her in her scientific pursuits. </p><p>Du Châtelet's legacy continues to inspire women in science and mathematics today. The French government created the Emilie du Châtelet Prize in 2007 to honor exceptional female scientists, and her work is celebrated by scholars and scientists around the world. Her life and achievements serve as a reminder of the power of determination and passion in pursuit of knowledge and intellectual advancement.</p><p></p><p>
