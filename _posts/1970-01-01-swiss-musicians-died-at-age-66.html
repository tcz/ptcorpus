Rousseau was also a passionate advocate for education, arguing that children should be encouraged to learn through their own experiences rather than being forced to memorize facts. His novel "Emile" is a classic work on education and remains widely read today. Rousseau's political ideas, particularly his emphasis on individual rights and popular sovereignty, were hugely influential in the struggle for democracy and human rights in the centuries that followed.
