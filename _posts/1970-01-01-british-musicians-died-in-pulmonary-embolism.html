He was also a prolific composer of film scores, contributing music to several movies, including Once Upon a Time in the Midlands and An American Werewolf in London.</p><p>Throughout his career, Jon Lord was widely regarded as one of the greatest keyboardists in rock history, and his influence on the Hammond organ and hard rock music continues to be felt to this day. He passed away in 2012 at the age of 71, leaving behind an incredible legacy of music that continues to inspire new generations of musicians.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=242149" title="Wikipedia article about Jon Lord">Jon Lord on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/croatian-actresses-died-in-2000.html' title='Croatian actresses died in 2000'><strong>Croatian actresses died in 2000</strong> List of the top 1 Croatian actresses who died in 2000</a></li><li><a href='/haitian-musicians-died-at-age-40.html' title='Haitian musicians died at age 40'><strong>Haitian musicians died at age 40</strong> List of the top 1 Haitian music stars who died when they were 40</a></li><li><a href='/bangladeshi-musicians-died-at-age-47.html' title='Bangladeshi musicians died at age 47'><strong>Bangladeshi musicians died at age 47</strong> List of the top 1 Bangladeshi music stars who died when they were 47</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/danish-musicians-died-in-liver-cancer.html' title='Danish musicians died in Liver cancer'><strong>Danish musicians died in Liver cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Danish music stars who died in Liver cancer</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-diphtheria.html' title='Famous actors died in Diphtheria'><strong>Famous actors died in Diphtheria</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actors who died in Diphtheria</a></li><li><a href='/greek-actors-died-at-age-28.html' title='Greek actors died at age 28'><strong>Greek actors died at age 28</strong> List of the top 1 Greek actors who died when they were 28</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
