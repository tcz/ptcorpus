(February 5, 1936		Albemarle-November 24, 1992)


was
an American
singer and actor.


						</p><p>She was best known as a member of Sun Ra's Arkestra, a musical ensemble led by jazz composer Sun Ra. Tyson's contributions to the Arkestra included singing, dancing, and playing percussion instruments. </p><p>Born in Albemarle, North Carolina, Tyson began her music career singing in gospel choirs. She joined Sun Ra's Arkestra in the mid-1950s and remained a member for over three decades. She appeared on numerous recordings with the group, including some of their most popular albums such as "Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy" and "The Magic City".</p><p>In addition to her work with the Arkestra, Tyson also appeared in several films, including "Space Is the Place", a science fiction film released in 1974 that featured Sun Ra and the Arkestra. She continued to perform with the Arkestra until her death in 1992 from pancreatic cancer. </p><p>Tyson's unique and powerful vocals helped define the sound of the Arkestra and influenced generations of musicians in a variety of genres. She remains a revered figure in the world of avant-garde jazz and experimental music.</p><p>Tyson's artistic contributions to the Arkestra were not limited to her vocal and percussion talents. She was also a skilled dancer and often performed elaborate routines as part of the group's live shows. In addition, Tyson was known for her theatrical flair, wearing elaborate costumes and headpieces that helped add to the Arkestra's otherworldly vibe.</p><p>Despite her prominence in the Arkestra, Tyson did not receive the recognition she deserved during her lifetime. Many of the group's recordings during the 1960s and 1970s did not credit specific musicians, making it difficult to fully appreciate Tyson's contributions. It wasn't until the 1980s and 1990s that she began to receive more attention, thanks in part to the rediscovery of some of the Arkestra's classic albums.</p><p>In addition to her work with Sun Ra, Tyson also released several solo albums, including the critically acclaimed "Saturnian Queen of the Sun Ra Arkestra" in 1979. She also collaborated with other avant-garde jazz musicians, including saxophonist Archie Shepp.</p><p>Today, Tyson's legacy lives on through her recordings with the Arkestra and her influence on musicians across multiple genres. Her unique voice and dynamic stage presence helped define one of the most inventive and influential musical groups of the 20th century.</p><p>Despite facing systemic racism throughout her life and career, Tyson remained committed to her art and the message of the Arkestra. In interviews, she spoke about the importance of creating music that challenged the status quo and encouraged listeners to question their assumptions about the world around them. She saw the Arkestra as a vehicle for social change and used her platform to advocate for greater understanding and acceptance across racial and cultural divides.</p><p>Tyson's influence on the world of music continues to be felt today, with many contemporary artists citing her as a major source of inspiration. Her contributions to the Arkestra helped push the boundaries of jazz and paved the way for generations of experimental musicians to come. As a performer, she brought a level of creativity and energy to the stage that was unmatched, earning her a reputation as one of the most dynamic and captivating singers of her time.</p><p>Despite her untimely death, Tyson's impact has only grown over the years, as new generations of listeners discover her music and appreciate her legacy. Her spirit of innovation, fearlessness, and creativity continues to inspire musicians and fans alike, making her a true icon of avant-garde jazz and a legendary figure in the history of American music.</p><p>In addition to her contributions as a performer, Tyson was also an advocate for music education and worked with young musicians throughout her career. She believed that music had the power to transform lives and communities, and often volunteered her time to mentor aspiring artists. She also taught workshops and master classes, sharing her knowledge and experience with a new generation of musicians.</p><p>Tyson's impact on the world of jazz and experimental music cannot be overstated. Her fearless approach to music-making and her dedication to breaking down barriers helped pave the way for future generations of innovators. Today, she is remembered as a true original and a trailblazer in the world of music. Her legacy continues to inspire artists to push the boundaries of what is possible and to use their art as a means of social change and transformation.</p><p></p><p>

His talent for songwriting earned him induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1989, and his songs have been covered by numerous artists, including Elvis Presley, The Monkees, and Captain and Tennille. Along with his work in the music industry, Greenfield was actively involved in charitable organizations and was honored with the inaugural ASCAP Foundation Howard Greenfield Award for lifetime achievement in pop music songwriting. Unfortunately, he passed away at the age of 49 due to complications from AIDS, leaving behind a legacy of beloved and enduring songs.</p><p>Greenfield was born in Brooklyn to a Jewish family and grew up in a musical household. He attended the New York City's High School of Music and Art, where he met Neil Sedaka. The two became fast friends and began writing and performing together. They went on to attend New York University, where Greenfield earned a degree in psychology. He later briefly pursued a career as a therapist but ultimately decided to focus on songwriting.</p><p>Greenfield and Sedaka's partnership resulted in over 200 recorded songs, many of which were top-ten hits. They also wrote for other artists, including Connie Francis, Brenda Lee, and Frank Sinatra. Their song "Love Will Keep Us Together" became a hit for Captain and Tennille and earned the duo a Grammy Award in 1976.</p><p>Greenfield was known for his ability to write lyrics that were both catchy and meaningful, often drawing on personal experiences for inspiration. He once said in an interview, "The best songs come out of some kind of experience, usually something that touches your heart."</p><p>In addition to his musical accomplishments, Greenfield was committed to social justice causes and worked with organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union and Gay Men's Health Crisis. He publicly acknowledged his HIV/AIDS diagnosis, which was uncommon at the time and helped to raise awareness about the disease.</p><p>Today, Greenfield's songs remain popular and are considered classics of the early rock and roll era. His contributions to the music industry and his advocacy work have left a lasting impact on both the artistic and social spheres.</p><p>Despite his success in the music industry, Howard Greenfield faced personal struggles throughout his life. He struggled with addiction, which ultimately led to a heart attack at the age of 39. He also experienced periods of depression and anxiety and sought therapy to manage his mental health. </p><p>However, Greenfield never stopped creating music. Even during his final years battling AIDS, he continued to write songs and collaborate with other artists. His dedication to his craft and his willingness to be open about his experiences with HIV/AIDS have inspired many in the music industry and beyond. </p><p>Today, Greenfield's legacy lives on not only through his music but also through the Howard and Phyllis Greenfield Foundation, which supports various charitable organizations, including those focused on music education and AIDS research.</p><p>In addition to his talents as a songwriter, Howard Greenfield was also known for his sense of humor and his ability to make those around him feel at ease. He was often described as warm and kind-hearted, and his infectious energy and positivity made him a beloved figure in the music industry.</p><p>Greenfield's dedication to social justice causes extended beyond his work with organizations. He also used his music as a tool for promoting unity and equality. In the midst of the Civil Rights Movement, he wrote the song "King of Clowns" in support of African American singer and activist Sammy Davis Jr. The song became a hit and helped to spread Davis's message of racial equality.</p><p>Although Howard Greenfield passed away at a young age, his impact on the music industry and society as a whole was immense. His powerful lyrics and memorable melodies continue to inspire and delight audiences around the world, and his commitment to social justice causes has paved the way for future generations to use music as a tool for positive change.</p><p></p><p>
