						</p><p>Escobar was the founder and leader of the notorious Medellín cartel, which at its peak was responsible for shipping over 80% of the cocaine smuggled into the United States. At the height of his power, Escobar was one of the richest men in the world, with an estimated net worth of around $30 billion.</p><p>Escobar was known for his brutal methods of dealing with enemies and rivals, including kidnappings, bombings, and assassinations. He was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, including police officers, journalists, and politicians.</p><p>In 1991, Escobar surrendered to the Colombian government as part of a deal that allowed him to build his own prison, nicknamed "La Catedral". However, he continued to run his criminal empire from prison, and was eventually forced to flee after the government decided to transfer him to a more secure facility.</p><p>Escobar spent the last few months of his life on the run from Colombian authorities, and was finally killed in a shootout with police in 1993. His legacy continues to loom large in Colombia and beyond, with many people both condemning and romanticizing his life of crime.</p><p>Despite his status as a notorious criminal, Escobar was known for his charisma and popular support in his home city of Medellín. He was known for his philanthropy, using his wealth to fund schools, hospitals, and other public works projects in impoverished areas of the city. However, he also justifies his crimes by saying he was providing a service demanded by the American people, who were the primary purchasers of cocaine.</p><p>Escobar's life and crimes have been the subject of numerous books, films, and television shows, including the hit Netflix series "Narcos". His death marked the end of an era in the global drug trade, but organized crime continues to be a major problem in many parts of the world.</p><p>Despite the violent nature of his criminal enterprise, there were some who saw Escobar as a Robin Hood-type figure who gave back to the poor communities that had been neglected by the Colombian government. He was known for building homes and public parks, and even sponsored a popular soccer team in Medellín. However, many of his philanthropic efforts were ultimately designed to win the loyalty of the local people and gain protection for his drug empire.</p><p>Following his death, his family went into hiding and changed their identities to avoid retribution from those who had been affected by Escobar's violence. His son, Juan Pablo Escobar, has since written a number of books about his father's life and crimes, and has become a vocal critic of the drug trade.</p><p>Despite his death over 25 years ago, Escobar's legacy continues to impact Colombia and the world at large. The Medellín cartel he founded has been largely dismantled, but the drug trade remains a major source of illicit income for criminal organizations around the globe. Escobar's notoriety has also made him a cultural icon, with his likeness appearing in all manner of pop culture and his story serving as the basis for many films and television shows.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in ballistic trauma.
