an Australian
writer.

She was a member of the Pioneer Players, a group of performers and playwrights who aimed to produce plays that reflected the realities of working-class life in Australia.</p><p>Tragically, Lesbia Harford died at the young age of 36 from septicemia after giving birth to a stillborn child. Despite her short life and career, she left a significant mark on Australian literature and politics. Her work continues to be studied and celebrated today as a testament to her commitment to social justice and equality.</p><p></p><p>
