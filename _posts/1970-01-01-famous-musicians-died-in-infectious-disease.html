						</p><p>Born in Sliven, Ottoman Empire (now Bulgaria), Anton Pann was of Aromanian origin and began his education at the age of six in a Greek-language school. He moved to Bucharest in 1812 and became a teacher and translator, eventually becoming one of the most important figures in Romanian culture during the period of national awakening in the 19th century.</p><p>Pann is known for his contributions to Romanian music, creating a fusion of traditional Byzantine and Ottoman music with Western European classical forms. He also wrote numerous poems, often drawing on folklore and mythology for inspiration, as well as translating works from other languages into Romanian. His lexicographical work, "The Wallachian Dictionary", was the first comprehensive dictionary of the Romanian language.</p><p>Pann's legacy continues to be felt in Romanian culture today, with many of his songs and poems still widely known and performed. He remains an important figure in the history of Romanian literature and music.</p><p>In addition to his impressive contributions to Romanian culture and society, Anton Pann was also known for his activism and political views. He was a strong supporter of the ideals of the French Revolution and advocated for social and political reforms in Romania. Pann was also a proponent of education and established several schools in Bucharest, including a school for girls which was quite progressive for its time. His dedication to education and social reform earned him the nickname "the teacher of the Romanian people." Despite facing many personal hardships throughout his life, including poverty and illness, Anton Pann remained committed to his work and his ideals until his death in 1854.</p><p></p><p>
