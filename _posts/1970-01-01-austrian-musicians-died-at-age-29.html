an Austrian
personality.


					
			
		Her children
		are
		called
		Pedro II of Brazil, Maria II of Portugal, Princess Francisca of Brazil, Januária Maria, Princess Imperial of Brazil, João Carlos, Prince of Beira and Princess Paula of Brazil.

						</p><p>Maria Leopoldina of Austria was the second daughter of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. In 1817, she was married to Prince Pedro, the heir to the Portuguese throne. Known for her education and intelligence, Maria Leopoldina was a strong advocate for the end of slavery in Brazil and for women's rights. She was also interested in the arts and sciences, and actively supported the development of scientific research in Brazil. During her time in Brazil, she played an important role in the country's declaration of independence from Portugal in 1822. Sadly, Maria Leopoldina died at the age of 29, just a few days after giving birth to her seventh child. She is regarded as a beloved figure in Brazil and is remembered for her contributions to the country's culture and history.</p><p>After the death of Maria Leopoldina, her husband Pedro I of Brazil was devastated and plunged into a deep depression. However, he continued to rule Brazil as Emperor and made efforts to honor his late wife's legacy. In 1826, he founded the Imperial Order of Dom Pedro I in her honor. The order was a chivalric order that recognized and rewarded individuals for their contributions to Brazil's culture and progress. Maria Leopoldina's impact on Brazil can still be seen today, with many statues and monuments dedicated to her throughout the country. In addition to her public contributions, she was also a devoted mother to her children and instilled in them a sense of duty and responsibility to their country.</p><p>Maria Leopoldina's appreciation for the sciences extended to her own personal interests, including botany, mineralogy, and zoology. She even established a botanical garden in Rio de Janeiro, which is still in use today. Maria Leopoldina also sought to improve education in Brazil and established a school for girls, where she personally taught science and literature. She was fluent in multiple languages, including Portuguese, which she learned specifically for her marriage to Pedro.</p><p>In addition to her contributions to Brazil, Maria Leopoldina had a significant impact on the Austrian monarchy as well. Her marriage to Pedro helped to secure Austria's position in Europe, and her intelligence and diplomatic prowess were highly valued by her father, Francis II. Despite spending only a short time in Brazil, Maria Leopoldina's influence there was significant and lasting. She is still fondly remembered and celebrated as an important figure in Brazilian history.</p><p></p><p>
