He served as a Republican United States Senator from Wisconsin from 1947 until his censure and downfall in 1954. McCarthy was known for his aggressive pursuit of individuals he believed to be communist sympathizers, launching a vast campaign against supposed subversives in government, the media and other areas of American society. This period is known as the "McCarthy Era". His tactics earned him the nickname "McCarthyism". </p><p>McCarthy attended Marquette University and later became a circuit court judge before being elected to the Senate. McCarthy's rise to national prominence came in 1950 when he claimed to have a list of 205 known communists working in the United States State Department. These accusations were later proven to be largely baseless. Nevertheless, they led to the creation of the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations and a renewed wave of anti-communist hysteria in the country.</p><p>Joseph McCarthy's political career began to unravel after he targeted the United States Army in a televised hearing in 1954. During the hearings, he was seen as bullying and intimidating towards witnesses, and his accusations were largely discredited. The Army-McCarthy hearings led to his eventual censure by the Senate later that year. </p><p>McCarthy's legacy remains a controversial topic to this day. Some admire his anti-communist stance, while others condemn his tactics as unconstitutional and damaging to individuals' civil liberties.</p><p>Joseph McCarthy was born in Grand Chute, Wisconsin in 1908.

He then attended Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he earned a law degree in 1935.</p><p>After completing his education, McCarthy worked as a lawyer in Wisconsin, specializing in criminal defense cases. In 1939, he was appointed a circuit court judge in Wisconsin, a position he held until 1942 when he joined the U.S. Marines during World War II. After the war, McCarthy returned to Wisconsin and resumed his law practice.</p><p>McCarthy's political career began in 1946 when he was elected to the U.S. Senate as a Republican from Wisconsin. He quickly made a name for himself as a fierce anti-communist, and his aggressive tactics earned him the nickname "Tailgunner Joe" for his claims of being a tail gunner during his time in the Marines.</p><p>In 1950, McCarthy made headlines when he claimed to have a list of 205 known communists working in the United States State Department. This accusation helped to launch the "Red Scare," a period of intense anti-communist hysteria in the United States. While McCarthy's claims were later proven to be largely baseless, he continued to pursue individuals he believed to be communists or communist sympathizers.</p><p>McCarthy's downfall came in 1954 when he targeted the U.S. Army in a televised hearing. During the hearings, McCarthy was seen as bullying and intimidating towards witnesses, and his accusations were largely discredited. The Army-McCarthy hearings led to his eventual censure by the Senate later that year. McCarthy's political career was effectively over, and he died in 1957 at the age of 48 due to complications from hepatitis.</p><p></p><p>
