(April 5, 1280-February 16, 1318			Nyköping Castle)


was
a Swedish
personality.


					</p><p>He was the son of King Magnus III of Sweden and his Queen consort, Helvig of Holstein. Valdemar spent much of his life in exile and only returned to Sweden in 1314. Upon his return, he was made the Duke of Finland by his elder brother King Birger of Sweden. </p><p>Valdemar was known for his military prowess and he led campaigns against the Russian Novgorod Republic. He was able to establish the city of Vyborg (now in modern-day Russia) as a Swedish stronghold in the region. </p><p>However, Valdemar's relationship with his brother Birger deteriorated quickly, and they soon became embroiled in a power struggle for control over the Swedish kingdom. In 1317, their conflict erupted into full-scale civil war, which ended with Birger's victory and Valdemar's imprisonment. </p><p>Valdemar died the following year in captivity, and it is said that he was murdered on the orders of his own brother. Despite his short life, Valdemar made a significant impact on Swedish history by establishing Vyborg and shaping the country's military policies.</p><p>Valdemar was also known for his interest in church affairs and was a patron of the Franciscan Order. He was instrumental in founding the Vadstena Abbey and helped establish the cult of Saint Birgitta of Sweden. Valdemar married Kristina, the daughter of King Eric II of Norway, and together they had one son, Erik. After Valdemar's death, Kristina remarried and went on to become the Queen of Norway. Valdemar's tragic end has made him a popular figure in Swedish history and he is often portrayed as a hero who fought against his ruthless brother for the good of the kingdom. His legacy lives on as one of the most prominent medieval figures in Sweden.</p><p>Valdemar was also known for his cultural interests, and he was considered a patron of the arts. He was particularly fond of music and is said to have played the lute and other instruments himself. During his time in exile, he spent much of his time in Germany and France, where he was exposed to new cultural ideas and influences.</p><p>In addition to his military and cultural accomplishments, Valdemar was also known for his diplomatic skills. He served as an ambassador to Norway and Denmark, where he worked to strengthen alliances between the Scandinavian countries. He was also known for his efforts to broker peace between Russia and Sweden, although these attempts were ultimately unsuccessful.</p><p>Valdemar's tragic death has been the subject of much speculation and debate. Some historians believe that he was indeed murdered on the orders of his brother, while others argue that he may have died of natural causes. Despite the uncertainty surrounding his death, Valdemar's life and accomplishments continue to be celebrated in Sweden, where he is remembered as a brave and talented leader who made significant contributions to his country's history.</p><p>During his time as Duke of Finland, Valdemar was instrumental in developing the region's infrastructure and economy. He granted trading privileges to merchants in Vyborg and instituted a system of taxation to fund public works projects. He also encouraged immigration to Finland, offering land and other incentives to settlers from Sweden and other parts of Europe. Under Valdemar's leadership, Finland became an important center of trade and commerce, connecting the Scandinavian countries to the Baltic region and beyond.</p><p>Valdemar was also a patron of the arts, sponsoring numerous cultural projects and events. He was a collector of books and manuscripts, and his personal library was among the finest in medieval Europe. He was also a supporter of the Troubadours, a group of traveling poets and musicians who performed throughout Europe. Valdemar's interest in music and the arts helped to foster a vibrant cultural scene in Sweden, which continues to this day.</p><p>Despite his successes as a military leader and patron of the arts, Valdemar's life was marked by tragedy and conflict. His relationship with his brother Birger was fraught from the beginning, and their rivalry ultimately led to Valdemar's downfall. Despite this, Valdemar remains an important figure in the history and culture of Scandinavia, remembered for his contributions to the development of Finland and his enduring legacy as a patron of the arts.</p><p></p><p>
