(February 25, 1684		Sautens-February 16, 1738			Prague)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a prominent Baroque sculptor and probably one of the most outstanding artists of his time. Matthias Braun carved figures in stone and wood, ranging from small devotional pieces to major altarpieces found in many churches across Europe. He worked in Austria, Germany, Italy, and the Czech Republic. Matthias Braun's works are characterized by their delicate and dynamic curves, expressive facial expressions, and intricate details. Some of his most remarkable works are the Charles Bridge statues and the sculptures on St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague Castle. He shaped the art of the High Baroque in Central Europe and his influence can still be seen in contemporary art today.</p><p>Matthias Braun was born to a family of woodcarvers in Sautens, Austria, where he began his career as an apprentice to his father. Showing great talent, he soon moved to Salzburg to work on several important projects. In 1708, he went to Italy to study the works of the great Baroque masters, including Bernini and Borromini.</p><p>Upon returning to Austria, Braun started working as an independent artist, earning commissions from churches and wealthy patrons. His reputation grew quickly, and by the age of 30, he was already regarded as one of the most gifted sculptors of his time.</p><p>In 1723, Braun moved to Prague, where he spent the rest of his life creating some of his most significant works. He was appointed court sculptor to the Habsburgs, and his works can be found in numerous churches, palaces, and public spaces throughout the Czech Republic.</p><p>Braun's contributions to 18th-century Baroque art cannot be overstated. He was a master of his craft, creating works that were not only technically impressive but also emotionally powerful. His sculptures were known for their realism, capturing the human form with remarkable accuracy and sensitivity.</p><p>Despite his fame and success, Braun remained humble throughout his life. He was known to be a devoted family man and a deeply religious Catholic. When he died in Prague in 1738, he left behind a legacy that continues to inspire artists and art lovers to this day.</p><p>One of Matthias Braun's most notable projects was the decoration of the St. Nicholas Church in Prague, which involved creating 18 statues and numerous reliefs. This project took him over a decade to complete and showcased his exceptional skill in creating dynamic and detailed sculptures.</p><p>Aside from his work as a sculptor, Braun was also an accomplished draftsman and produced many sketches and studies in preparation for his sculptures. He was known to be a meticulous planner, often creating multiple sketches and models before deciding on a final design.</p><p>Braun's influence on Baroque art extended beyond his own works, as he also trained a number of apprentices who went on to become successful sculptors in their own right. His legacy continues to be celebrated in exhibitions and collections around the world, and his works remain some of the most iconic examples of Baroque sculpture.</p><p>In addition to his works in churches and public spaces, Matthias Braun also created a number of portrait busts of prominent individuals, including members of the Habsburg royal family. These portraits, often made in marble, showcased his ability to capture not only the physical likeness but also the personality of his subjects.</p><p>Braun's skill and reputation also earned him a number of prestigious awards and honors during his lifetime. He was elected a member of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, and in 1724 he was awarded the Order of the Golden Spur by Pope Benedict XIII.</p><p>Despite his success, Braun faced some challenges in his personal life. He experienced financial difficulties at times and had to borrow money from friends and acquaintances. He also suffered from health problems, which may have been related to his work with heavy stone and wood.</p><p>Today, Matthias Braun is remembered as one of the greatest sculptors of the Baroque era, and his works continue to inspire admiration and awe. His contributions to the art world have left an indelible mark on history, and his legacy continues to be celebrated by art historians, collectors, and enthusiasts.</p><p></p><p>

(March 9, 1892		Vienna-April 8, 1945			Kirchstetten)

	
		a.k.a. Weinheber, Josef

	
was
an Austrian
writer.


					</p><p>Weinheber was known primarily for his poetry, which was marked by its romanticism and traditionalism. He won several awards for his works, including the Austrian State Prize for Literature in 1937. Despite his success, Weinheber's association with the Nazi party, as well as his controversial views on race and politics, led to his downfall in the post-war era. In 1943, he was stripped of his membership in the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and in 1945, just weeks before the end of World War II, he took his own life. Despite the controversies surrounding his life and legacy, Weinheber is still widely regarded as one of Austria's most important literary figures.</p><p>In addition to his poetry, Josef Weinheber also wrote essays and plays, and translated works from Spanish, French and Italian into German. He was renowned for his masterful use of language and his ability to capture the essence of Austrian culture and identity in his writing. </p><p>Weinheber's association with the Nazi party, which began in the early 1930s, was motivated in part by his disillusionment with the social and political upheaval that followed World War I. However, his views on race and politics, which emphasized the superiority of the Aryan race and the need for authoritarian government, were at odds with the democratic ideals of many of his fellow Austrians. </p><p>Despite these controversies, Weinheber's work remained popular throughout his life and continues to be admired today. His poems often reflect the political and cultural context of inter-war Austria, and are marked by their introspection, melancholy, and nostalgia for a simpler time. Today, Weinheber is seen as a complex and multifaceted figure whose legacy continues to spark debate among literary scholars and historians.</p><p>Despite his association with the Nazi party, it is worth noting that Josef Weinheber’s work was not overtly political, and he was not known to be directly involved in any acts of violence or oppression. Rather, his poetry and other writings often focused on more personal concerns, such as love, loss, and the beauty of the natural world. Some scholars have suggested that Weinheber's politics may have been more a product of his social and cultural milieu than a deeply held conviction, and that his tragic end may have been a result of his mounting guilt and shame over his association with the Nazis.</p><p>In addition to his literary work, Josef Weinheber was also an accomplished musician and composer, and wrote several songs and chamber pieces. He was a friend and collaborator of many prominent Austrian artists and intellectuals, including the composer Franz Schreker and the writer Hermann Broch. Weinheber's influence on Austrian literature and culture continues to be felt to this day, with his poems and other works widely taught and studied in Austrian schools and universities. Despite the controversies surrounding his life and political views, Josef Weinheber remains an important figure in the history of Austrian literature, and his legacy continues to inspire and challenge readers and scholars alike.</p><p>Weinheber's suicide in 1945 was seen as a tragic end to a controversial life. In the years since his death, his legacy has been the subject of much debate and discussion. Some have argued that his association with the Nazi party and his controversial views on race and politics render his work irrelevant or offensive. Others have pointed to the beauty and craftsmanship of his poetry, and emphasized the complexity and nuance of his personality and beliefs. </p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his life, Weinheber remains an important figure in the history of Austrian literature, and his poetry continues to be read and studied today. His work has been translated into multiple languages and continues to be recognized for its lyrical beauty, emotional depth, and haunting evocations of the Austrian landscape and culture. While his life and legacy may remain contested, there can be no doubt that Josef Weinheber was one of Austria's most talented and enigmatic literary figures.</p><p></p><p>

His first collection of poetry, "Wehvolles Erbe" (Painful Inheritance), was published in 1921, and he went on to publish several more volumes, including "Der Wanderer" (The Wanderer) and "Zwischen Nacht und Morgen" (Between Night and Morning).

He was decorated for his bravery and his experiences during the war had a profound effect on his writing, which often dealt with themes of loss, trauma, and disillusionment.</p><p>After the war, Austria was in a state of political turmoil and Wilhelm became an early supporter of the conservative Austrofascist movement. He was appointed to various political positions and supported the authoritarian rule of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, which led to Austria becoming a one-party dictatorship.</p><p>In 1938, Nazi Germany annexed Austria and Wilhelm was forced into exile. He spent several years in France, Belgium, and Spain before eventually settling in Kiev, where he lived a quiet and reclusive life until his death in 1948.</p><p>Despite his controversial political views, Archduke Wilhelm was widely respected for his contributions to Austrian literature. His poems reflected a deep sense of longing for a lost era of aristocratic culture and his works remain an important part of the literary canon of Austrian poetry.</p><p>In addition to his talents as a poet, painter, and musician, Archduke Wilhelm was also an avid traveler and explorer. He made several trips to Africa and Asia during his lifetime, documenting his adventures in journals and photographs. Wilhelm was particularly interested in the cultures and traditions of non-European societies, and his writings reflect his curiosity and fascination with exotic landscapes and customs.</p><p>Despite his privileged upbringing and aristocratic status, Wilhelm was known for his empathy and sensitivity towards those less fortunate than himself. He was deeply concerned with the plight of the working class and often used his writing to advocate for social justice and equality.</p><p>In his later years, Wilhelm's health began to deteriorate and he became increasingly isolated from the outside world. He spent much of his time reading and writing, and his correspondence with fellow writers and intellectuals was an important source of intellectual stimulation and companionship.</p><p>Today, Archduke Wilhelm of Austria is remembered as a complex and multifaceted figure, whose contributions to literature and culture continue to be celebrated and analyzed by scholars and enthusiasts around the world.</p><p></p><p>

He spent years living among the Bedouin people, learning their languages and customs, and recording their oral histories. He also made many important archaeological discoveries, including the remains of ancient cities and trading centers.</p><p>Glaser's most significant work, however, was his study of the inscriptions found in Bahrain and Oman.

His work was widely praised by scholars around the world and helped establish his reputation as one of the leading experts on the history of the Middle East.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced during his expeditions, including illness and political unrest, Glaser remained passionate about his work and continued to travel and explore until his death of a heart attack at the age of 53.
