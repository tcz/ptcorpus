(May 16, 1965		Amalfi-April 1, 2004)

	
		also known as Carlos Castano

	
was
a Colombian
warlord.


					</p><p>He was the founder and leader of the paramilitary organization known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). Castaño was born into a wealthy family and had a privileged upbringing. He attended a military school and later joined the Colombian army but left due to ideological differences. He then went on to form the AUC, a right-wing paramilitary organization that fought against leftist guerrillas and drug cartels.</p><p>Under Castaño's leadership, the AUC carried out numerous human rights abuses, including massacres and forced displacement of civilians. The AUC was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, including union leaders, journalists, and politicians. Castaño himself was accused of numerous crimes but was never convicted.</p><p>In 2004, Castaño was reportedly killed by his own men, who were said to be dissatisfied with his leadership. His death marked the beginning of the demobilization of the AUC, which formally disbanded in 2006. Castaño's legacy remains controversial, with some hailing him as a hero for fighting against leftist guerrillas and others condemning him for his brutal tactics and human rights abuses.</p><p>Castaño was also known for his connections to drug trafficking. He allegedly had ties to the infamous Medellín Cartel and played a role in the production and distribution of cocaine in Colombia. However, Castaño maintained that the AUC was fighting against the drug cartels and claimed that the paramilitary group was motivated by a desire to protect the Colombian people from criminal organizations.In addition to his involvement in the AUC, Castaño was also a prolific writer. He wrote several books, including "Mi Confesión," which detailed his life and involvement in the paramilitary group. The book was controversial and drew criticism for glorifying Castaño's violent actions.Castaño's death and the subsequent demobilization of the AUC did not bring an end to violence and conflict in Colombia. The country continues to face challenges related to drug trafficking, leftist guerrillas, and paramilitary groups. Castaño's legacy is a reminder of the complex and often violent history of Colombia.</p><p>Castaño was not the only member of his family to be involved in the paramilitary organization; his brothers Vicente and Fidel were also high-ranking members of the AUC. The Castaño brothers were known for their ruthless tactics, with Fidel once stating that "the only negotiation we'll do is with bullets."After Castaño's death, his brother Vicente took over as leader of the AUC. Vicente was later killed in 2007, allegedly by members of the AUC who were unhappy with his leadership.In addition to his involvement in the AUC, Castaño was an outspoken critic of left-wing politics in Colombia. He was a staunch supporter of former president Alvaro Uribe and his hardline approach to fighting against guerrilla groups and drug cartels.Castaño's death remains shrouded in mystery, with some speculating that he was actually killed by government forces in an attempt to silence him. However, most agree that his death was a result of internal power struggles within the AUC.Castaño's legacy continues to be a contentious issue in Colombia. Some argue that his fight against leftist guerrillas and drug cartels was necessary to protect the country from harm, while others condemn him for his brutal tactics and disregard for human rights. The debate over his legacy is a reflection of the ongoing challenges facing Colombia as it navigates the post-conflict era.</p><p></p><p>
