		a.k.a. John Birnie Marshall

	
was
an Australian
swimmer.


					</p><p>He competed in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, winning a gold medal in the 200-meter butterfly and a bronze medal in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay. Marshall was known for his unique butterfly stroke, which involved a dolphin kick and an undulating arm movement that helped push him through the water. He set several world records during his swimming career and was widely regarded as one of the best butterfly swimmers of his time. After retiring from swimming, Marshall became a schoolteacher but tragically died in a car accident at the age of 26. He was posthumously inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1988.</p><p>Marshall's interest in swimming started at a young age, as he grew up near the beach and spent many hours swimming in the ocean. He soon joined a local swim club and began to compete in various events. Marshall's talent and dedication to the sport quickly became evident as he won multiple championships and set numerous records.</p><p>In addition to his success in the Olympics, Marshall also won four gold medals and two silver medals at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. He continued to compete at a high level throughout his career, even setting a new world record in the 200-meter butterfly just months before his tragic death.</p><p>Marshall was known for his humble and modest personality, often downplaying his achievements and crediting his coaches and teammates for his success. He is remembered as a talented athlete and a dedicated teacher who inspired many young students to pursue their passions.</p><p>In his honor, the John Birnie Marshall Memorial Trophy was established to recognize the best male swimmer at the Australian Championships. Marshall's legacy continues to inspire and motivate swimmers around the world.</p><p>Marshall's unique butterfly stroke was developed through trial and error, as he experimented with different techniques in order to find the most efficient way to move through the water. He eventually settled on a technique that combined the best elements of different styles, such as the dolphin kick from the breaststroke and the undulating arm movement of the butterfly stroke.</p><p>Despite his success in swimming, Marshall faced some challenges off the pool as well. As an openly gay man in a time when homosexuality was still criminalized in Australia, he faced discrimination and prejudice from some members of society. Marshall's legacy includes not only his athletic achievements but also his courage in living his life authentically despite these challenges.</p><p>In addition to the John Birnie Marshall Memorial Trophy, Marshall's memory is also honored through the John Marshall Fellowship, which provides financial support to graduate students in education at the University of Sydney. The fellowship was established in recognition of Marshall's contributions to education as a teacher and his passion for learning.</p><p></p><p>
