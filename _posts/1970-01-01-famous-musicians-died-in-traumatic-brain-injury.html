(February 11, 2015		Eleusis-February 11, 2015			Gela)

	
		also known as Esquilo, Aiskhylos or Eschyle

	
was
an Athenian
soldier and playwright.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Euphorion and Euaeon.

						</p><p>Aeschylus is often referred to as the father of Greek tragedy and is considered to be one of the most important dramatists in Western literature. He is credited with introducing a second actor on stage, which allowed for more complex plot development and character interactions. Aeschylus wrote over 80 plays, but only seven have survived in their entirety. One of his most famous works is the Oresteia, which is a trilogy of plays that explore the themes of justice, revenge and the role of the gods in human affairs. Aeschylus' plays were performed in festivals throughout ancient Greece and continue to be studied and performed today. He died in 456 BCE, while visiting Sicily.</p><p>Aeschylus was renowned for incorporating deeper philosophical concepts into his plays, paving the way for the inclusion of moral and ethical dilemmas in theatrical productions. He was also known for his use of dramatic and grand language, which helped to elevate his writing to an art form. Aeschylus won the prestigious Athenian playwriting competition 13 times over the course of his career, cementing his legacy as a master of his craft. Despite his success, he faced criticism from some of his contemporaries for his unconventional approach to tragedy. Today, he is remembered as a pioneering figure in Greek literature and a transformative influence on the development of Western drama.</p><p>Aeschylus was not only a talented playwright but also a brave soldier. He fought in the Battle of Marathon in 490 BCE and also participated in the Persian Wars. His experiences as a soldier and citizen of Athens greatly influenced his work, as he often explored themes of patriotism and heroism in his plays. In addition to his contributions to theater, Aeschylus is also credited with inventing or refining the masks and costumes worn by actors in Greek drama. These costumes were highly stylized and symbolic, and helped to create a sense of ritual and ceremony in the performances. A statue of Aeschylus still stands in Athens today, as a tribute to his enduring legacy as a pioneering figure in Western literature.</p><p>Aeschylus was born into a noble family in Eleusis, a small town outside of Athens. It is believed that he first participated in the Dionysian and Lenaea festivals as an actor before turning his hand to playwriting. His first victory in a playwriting competition came in 484 BCE, when he won first place in the City Dionysia for his play The Persians. Aeschylus' innovations in theater helped to transform the art form, paving the way for other great dramatists like Sophocles and Euripides. He was also known for his involvement in Athenian civic life, serving as a member of the demos and fighting in several important battles. Aeschylus' impact on theater and literature has been far-reaching, influencing writers and thinkers throughout the Western world for centuries.</p><p></p><p>
