(July 5, 1962		Indonesia-November 9, 2008)


was
an Indonesian
personality.


					</p><p>Amrozi bin Nurhasyim was a member of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist group, responsible for the 2002 Bali bombings, which killed 202 people, mostly tourists. Amrozi, along with his two brothers, Mukhlas and Ali Ghufron, played a key role in planning and carrying out the attack. He was arrested on November 5, 2002, and sentenced to death for his role in the bombings. On November 9, 2008, he was executed by firing squad on the island of Nusakambangan. His execution was widely reported and discussed around the world, sparking debates about the use of capital punishment and the role of terrorism in global conflicts.</p><p>Amrozi bin Nurhasyim was born in Tenggulun, Indonesia, and was one of nine children in his family. He grew up in a religious household and received his education from local Islamic schools. Before becoming involved in the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist group, Amrozi worked as a mechanic and owned a repair shop. He was said to have become radicalized during the early 2000s and was inspired by the teachings of Osama bin Laden.</p><p>After the Bali bombings, Amrozi and his brothers went into hiding, but they were eventually captured by Indonesian authorities. During his trial, Amrozi showed little remorse for his actions, referring to the victims of the attack as "infidels" and "sinners." He was convicted of murder, terrorism, and illegal possession of explosives and given the death penalty. His execution was delayed for six years due to an appeal process and public debate over the use of the death penalty.</p><p>Amrozi's execution was carried out along with two other Bali bombers, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were also sentenced to death. The Indonesian government defended the decision to execute the men, stating that it was necessary to bring justice to the victims of the Bali bombings. However, the use of the death penalty was criticized by some human rights advocates, who argued that it was an inhumane and ineffective form of punishment. Despite the controversy surrounding his execution, Amrozi remains infamous for his role in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in modern history.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by execution by firing squad.
