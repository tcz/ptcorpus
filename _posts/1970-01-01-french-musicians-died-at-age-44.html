was
a French
writer, journalist and philosopher.


					</p><p>Mounier was the founder and main theorist of the personalist movement in philosophy, which emphasized the value of the individual and their unique experiences. He explored the relationship between spirituality, politics and social justice, and his ideas helped shape the Catholic social thought movement. Mounier was also an active member of the French Resistance during World War II and founded the magazine "Esprit", which became known for its promotion of democratic values and intellectual freedom. He died at the young age of 44 from a heart attack, leaving behind a vast legacy of philosophical and literary works that continue to influence scholars and thinkers to this day.</p><p>Mounier was born in Grenoble, France and grew up in a Catholic family. He studied philosophy and literature at the Sorbonne in Paris and later taught philosophy at the University of Strasbourg. In addition to his work as a philosopher, Mounier was a prolific essayist and wrote extensively on politics, literature, and culture.</p><p>Mounier's personalist philosophy was influenced by the existentialist movement of the time, as well as his Catholic faith. He believed that the human person is unique and valuable, and that society should be organized to promote the flourishing of each individual. He also believed that spirituality and social justice were intertwined, and that individuals had a moral obligation to work towards creating a more just society.</p><p>During World War II, Mounier was heavily involved in the French Resistance and was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943. He spent the remainder of the war in several concentration camps before being released in 1945. After the war, he founded the magazine "Esprit", which was dedicated to promoting democratic values and intellectual freedom.</p><p>Mounier's ideas have had a significant impact on Catholic social thought and continue to influence philosophical and political discussions today. His works include "Personalism", "The Drama of Humanism", and "Traité du caractère".</p><p>Mounier's personalist philosophy had a significant influence on Catholic social teaching, as well as on the broader social and political landscape of France at the time. His ideas were instrumental in the creation of the French Christian Democratic movement and played a part in shaping the post-World War II political landscape in France. His ideas also resonated with the wider humanist movement of the time, which emphasized the importance of the individual and their unique experiences. </p><p>Mounier's literary works were also highly regarded, and he was known for his insightful essays on a wide range of topics, including literature, culture, and politics. As a journalist, he also wrote for a number of newspapers and magazines, including "Le Figaro" and "L'Action Française". </p><p>Despite his many accomplishments and widespread influence, Mounier's life was cut tragically short when he suffered a fatal heart attack at the young age of 44. Nevertheless, his legacy as a philosopher, writer, and advocate for human dignity and social justice continues to inspire scholars and thinkers around the world to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(July 25, 1921		Grenoble-September 23, 1965			Vercors Massif)


was
a French
mountain guide, mountaineer and actor.


					</p><p>Lionel Terray was one of the foremost alpinists of his generation, and his accomplishments in the mountains earned him a reputation as a legend in the climbing community. In addition to his feats as a mountaineer, Terray was also an accomplished author and actor. He wrote several books on mountaineering, including "Conquistadors of the Useless," which chronicled his expeditions in the Alps and the Himalayas. As an actor, he appeared in several French films, including "La Grande Vadrouille" and "The Black Rose." Despite his success in these pursuits, Terray is perhaps best remembered for his contributions to the development of mountaineering equipment and techniques. He was instrumental in the design of the "Terray Tent," which revolutionized high-altitude camping, and his approach to climbing inspired a generation of mountaineers. Terray's tragic death in a climbing accident in 1965 was a great loss to the mountaineering community, but his legacy lives on through his numerous contributions to the sport.</p><p>Lionel Terray began his career in the French Resistance during World War II, and it was during this time that he developed his skills climbing in the Vercors Massif. After the war, he became a mountain guide and began making significant climbs in the Alps. He was a member of the successful French expedition to Annapurna in 1950, during which he made the first ascent of the mountain's north face. Terray also made notable ascents in the Mont Blanc Massif, including the first ascent of the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey.</p><p>In addition to his climbing achievements, Terray was also an advocate for preserving the natural environment. He was one of the founding members of the French National Federation of Alpine and Mountain Clubs and worked to promote responsible mountaineering practices.</p><p>Terray's influence on the world of mountaineering is still felt today. The Terray Tent, which he helped design in the 1950s, is still used by climbers around the world, and his approach to climbing and mountaineering equipment design continues to be studied and admired. Terray has been described as a "climber's climber," and his passion for the outdoors and the mountains is evident in all aspects of his life.</p><p>Terray's legacy also includes his innovative approach to climbing techniques. He believed in taking a more practical and efficient approach to climbing, which meant using less gear and relying more on his own strength and skill. This approach, which is now known as alpine style climbing, has become a cornerstone of modern mountaineering.</p><p>Terray's commitment to the environment extended beyond his advocacy for responsible mountaineering practices. He was also a champion of conservation efforts, working with organizations like the French Alpine Club and Friends of the Earth to protect wilderness areas around the world.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Terray remained humble and grounded throughout his life. He was known for his kindness and generosity, and his willingness to share his knowledge and experience with others. His contributions to mountaineering, literature, and film continue to inspire generations of climbers and outdoor enthusiasts around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(March 29, 1864		Limoges-February 20, 1909			Paris)


was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>Paul Ranson was a French painter and one of the pioneers of the Nabis movement, a group of French artists active in the late 19th century. Born into a family of artists, Ranson was a graduate of the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He experimented with different styles before finding his niche in the Nabis circle, where he developed a unique style known for its flatness, bold use of color, and decorative quality.</p><p>Ranson's work reflects his interest in nature, mythology, and the occult. He often depicted forest scenes, and his paintings are characterized by a dreamlike, mystical quality. Along with his work as a painter, Ranson was also active in the decorative arts, creating designs for furniture, textiles, and ceramics.</p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Ranson was influential in the development of modern art. His innovative use of color and decoration paved the way for artists such as Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard, who would go on to become major figures in the French art world. Today, Ranson's work can be seen in museums and galleries throughout France and around the world.</p><p>Ranson's fascination with nature led him to spend a considerable amount of time in the countryside, where he found inspiration for his paintings. He was also interested in the symbolism of ancient cultures, particularly those of Egypt and the Celts. This interest is reflected in his work, which often features mythological figures and mystical landscapes.</p><p>Ranson was a founding member of the Nabis movement, which was founded in 1888. The group was characterized by their rejection of traditional painting techniques and their interest in spirituality and mysticism. They experimented with different styles and techniques, including flatness, decorative patterning, and bold use of color.</p><p>In addition to his work as a painter and designer, Ranson was also a teacher. He taught at the Académie Carmen in Paris, where he influenced a new generation of artists. His students included the likes of Maurice Denis, Ker-Xavier Roussel, and Edouard Vuillard.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ranson's career was cut short when he died at the age of 44 from a kidney infection. Despite his relatively short career, his legacy lives on in the work of later artists who were influenced by his innovative style and approach to painting.</p><p>Ranson's interest in the decorative arts began during his childhood, when he would often help his parents, who were both decorative artists. He went on to take classes in decorative art, which would become a major focus of his career. He was particularly interested in the use of patterns and motifs in art and design.</p><p>Ranson was also involved in the Parisian artistic community, and was friends with many of the leading artists of the day, including Edgar Degas, Auguste Rodin, and Paul Gauguin. Gauguin's use of bright colors and flat forms was a major influence on Ranson's work, and he tried to incorporate some of these techniques into his own paintings.</p><p>Despite his success, Ranson's personal life was marked by tragedy. His first wife died in childbirth, and he would later lose another wife and a child to illness. These losses had a profound impact on Ranson, and many of his paintings from this period are somber and introspective.</p><p>Despite these difficulties, Ranson continued to produce innovative work up until his death. His paintings and designs are now highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts of the Nabis movement, and his influence can be seen in the work of later artists such as the Fauves and the Surrealists.</p><p></p><p>
