However, Pishevari eventually became disillusioned with Mossadegh and formed his own political party.</p><p>During his time as leader of the Azerbaijani People's Government, Pishevari implemented several progressive policies, such as land reform and the promotion of women's rights. He also worked closely with the Soviet authorities, which led to accusations of him being a Soviet puppet by his opponents.</p><p>After the Iranian army retook control of the Azerbaijani region in 1947, Pishevari fled to the Soviet Union along with several of his supporters. He continued to advocate for the rights of the Azerbaijani people while in exile and wrote several books on Azerbaijani history and culture.</p><p>Today, Pishevari is celebrated in Azerbaijan as a national hero and is honored with monuments and museums dedicated to his life and legacy.

After the war, he held several prominent positions in the Iranian government, including as the head of the Ideological-Political Bureau of the Iranian Armed Forces and as a member of Iran's Supreme National Security Council.

He continued to play a significant role in the country's national security apparatus and was widely respected for his patriotism and dedication to the Islamic Republic.</p><p>Shirazi's death in 1999 shocked the country and sparked widespread speculation about the motives and perpetrators behind the assassination.
