									</h1><p>Here are 14 famous musicians from Switzerland died at 63:</p><h2>Benjamin Constant</h2><p><strong>Benjamin Constant</strong>
(October 25, 1767		Lausanne-December 8, 1830			Paris)


was
a Swiss
writer and politician.


					</p><p>He was a leading exponent of Liberalism during the post-revolutionary period in France, and his works exerted a profound influence on the Romantic generation. He began his political career as a supporter of the French Revolution but eventually became disillusioned with its excesses. In turn, he became a vocal critic of Napoleon Bonaparte and supported the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. Constant was a prolific writer and his essays, novels, and plays were widely read throughout Europe. His most famous work, "Adolphe," is considered a classic of Romantic literature. In addition to his literary accomplishments, Constant also served as a member of parliament in both France and Switzerland. He is remembered today as a champion of individual liberty and the rule of law.</p><p>Constant was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, to a family of French Huguenot ancestry. He spent his early childhood in the German-speaking city of Brunswick, where his father served as a military officer. Constant later attended the University of Edinburgh, where he was strongly influenced by the Scottish Enlightenment philosophers. He returned to Switzerland in 1787 and began a career as a journalist and writer, quickly making a name for himself in European literary circles.</p><p>In 1795, Constant moved to Paris and became involved in the intellectual and political ferment of the French Revolution. He embraced the ideals of individual freedom and representative government and joined the circle of thinkers known as the "Philosophes." He also served as a delegate to the Council of Five Hundred, one of the two houses of the French parliament.</p><p>Despite his early enthusiasm for the Revolution, Constant soon became disillusioned with the radicalism of the Jacobin government and the Reign of Terror. He criticized the regime in his writings and was forced to flee France in 1797. He returned to Switzerland, where he became involved in politics and served as a member of the Swiss Diet, the country's legislature.</p><p>In 1806, Constant returned to France and became a vocal critic of Napoleon Bonaparte's authoritarian rule. He argued for a constitutional monarchy and defended the rights of individuals and minorities against the tyranny of the state. He also wrote extensively on religion, ethics, and philosophy, and his ideas influenced many of the leading thinkers of his time.</p><p>Despite his political and intellectual achievements, Constant struggled with personal demons throughout his life. He suffered from depression and insomnia and had numerous affairs, including a long-term relationship with Madame de Staël, one of the most celebrated women writers of the era. He died in Paris in 1830, at the age of 63, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most influential thinkers of his time.</p><p>Constant was also known for his advocacy for the separation of church and state, which he believed was essential to protecting individual freedom. He argued that religion should not be used as a tool for political control, and that individuals should be free to practice their own beliefs without interference from the state. His views on this topic were not always well-received, and he faced criticism and even persecution for his ideas.</p><p>In addition to his political and philosophical writings, Constant was also a prolific novelist and playwright. His works often explored themes of love, passion, and moral ambiguity, and his characters were known for their complexity and psychological depth. His novel "Adolphe," which tells the story of a young man struggling with his feelings for an older woman, is considered a classic of Romantic literature and has been widely read and studied.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced in his personal life, Constant remained committed to his ideals of individual liberty and democratic government throughout his career. His writings continue to be studied and debated by scholars and thinkers around the world, and his legacy as a champion of freedom and human rights remains an important part of his lasting impact.</p><p></p><p>

		Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle.

						</p><p>Augustin Pyramus de Candolle was an influential figure in the field of botany and is considered one of the most important botanists of his time. He published numerous works throughout his career, including his highly regarded "Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis" which aimed to provide a comprehensive survey of all known plant species. He also contributed greatly to the study of plant geography, identifying and classifying different plant species based on their geographical location. Additionally, de Candolle was an advocate for plant conservation and was one of the first scientists to recognize the importance of preserving biodiversity. His work continues to have a significant impact on the field of botany today.</p><p>De Candolle came from a family of prominent botanists and scholars, and he himself received a thorough education in the sciences. He studied medicine and botany in Paris and was greatly influenced by the work of scholars such as Jussieu and Lamarck. De Candolle's botanical research spanned several decades and encompassed a wide range of topics, from the classification of plants to their pharmacological properties. </p><p>One important contribution that de Candolle made to the field of botany was his development of the concept of "natural families" of plants. This referred to groups of plants that shared common characteristics and could be classified together based on their morphological features. De Candolle's approach to plant classification was based on an extensive analysis of plant specimens from all over the world, which allowed him to develop a more comprehensive understanding of their similarities and differences.</p><p>In addition to his botanical research, de Candolle was also involved in public service and politics. He served as a member of the Geneva Grand Council and was an advocate for education and social reform. He was also a supporter of the emancipation of slaves, and was known for his opposition to colonialism and imperialism.</p><p>De Candolle's influence as a botanist and scholar was reflected in the many honors and awards he received throughout his life. He was elected as a member of several scientific societies, including the Royal Society of London and the French Academy of Sciences. He also received honorary degrees from universities in France, Germany, and Sweden. Today, de Candolle is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of botany, and his legacy continues to inspire botanists and scientists around the world.</p><p>De Candolle's work was not limited to plant taxonomy and classification. He also made significant contributions to the study of plant physiology, including research on the movement of sap in plants and the role of leaves in transpiration. Furthermore, he was one of the first scientists to use statistical analysis in the study of plant distribution, which allowed him to identify patterns in plant populations across different regions.</p><p>De Candolle's influence extended beyond his scientific work. He was a strong advocate for the use of knowledge and reason in all areas of life and was an active supporter of the Enlightenment ideals that were prevalent during his time. Additionally, he was a multilingual scholar who spoke several languages, including Latin, French, German, and English.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, de Candolle faced significant challenges during his career. He struggled with financial difficulties and was forced to sell his extensive plant collection in order to support himself and his family. Additionally, his work was sometimes controversial, and he faced criticism from other scientists who disagreed with his methods or findings.</p><p>Despite these challenges, de Candolle's contributions to the field of botany were extensive and continue to be celebrated today. His work paved the way for many of the advances in plant classification and taxonomy that have taken place since his time, and his commitment to conservation and the preservation of biodiversity remain important goals for scientists and policymakers alike.</p><p></p><p>

(March 31, 1699		Vevey-July 29, 1762			Chambéry)

	
		also known as Francoise-Louise de Warens

	
was
a Swiss
personality.


					</p><p>She is best known for her role as a mentor to philosopher and writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau, with whom she had a romantic relationship. De Warens played a significant role in Rousseau's intellectual and personal development, providing him with guidance and financial support during their ten-year relationship. Prior to their relationship, de Warens had an adventurous life, converting from Protestantism to Catholicism and travelling extensively throughout Europe. She was also known for her philanthropy, particularly in assisting young women in need. De Warens died in Chambéry in 1762, and her legacy has been celebrated for her impact on Rousseau's ideas and life.</p><p>De Warens was born into a wealthy Protestant family in Vevey, Switzerland. However, she was orphaned at a young age and was raised by relatives. At age 16, she converted to Catholicism and began a life of adventure and travel. She worked as a governess and lived with various benefactors, eventually settling in Chambéry where she became known for her philanthropy and charitable work.</p><p>It was in Chambéry where she met Rousseau in 1731, who was then a struggling young man. She took him under her wing and introduced him to her circle of influential friends, which helped him get his start as a writer. Their romantic relationship did not last, but they remained close friends for the rest of their lives.</p><p>In addition to her influence on Rousseau, de Warens was also a great influence on the ideas of the Enlightenment, particularly in the areas of education, social justice, and women's rights. She was a fervent advocate for the education of women, helping to establish schools for girls and supporting their intellectual pursuits.</p><p>De Warens' legacy extends beyond her impact on Rousseau and the Enlightenment. She was a trailblazer for women in a world dominated by men, and her life and accomplishments continue to inspire generations of women to this day.</p><p>De Warens' travels began when she was sent to live with her Catholic maternal uncle in Yenne, France, soon after her conversion. She left his home and travelled around France and Italy, engaging in multiple love affairs with men of different backgrounds. She eventually returned to Switzerland, where she purchased a house near Chambéry using the fortune she had amassed over the years. It was here that she met Rousseau and began their intense relationship.</p><p>De Warens' generosity extended beyond her philanthropic work with young women, as she also supported Rousseau financially and even allowed him to live in her home when he had nowhere else to go. Their time together was marked by intense emotion and personal growth, as Rousseau attributed much of his own ideas and success to her influence.</p><p>Despite her impact on his work, Rousseau's later writings included some ill-natured characterizations of de Warens, which caused her great pain. However, this does not diminish her lasting legacy as a pioneering woman of the Enlightenment era. Her influence on Rousseau, as well as her advocacy for women's education and social justice, make her a notable figure in history.</p><p></p><p>

He also composed a significant amount of solo and chamber music, including works for piano, violin, and voice. His compositions were noted for their simplicity and directness, often incorporating folk melodies and popular tunes of the day.

He also advocated for universal education and was instrumental in the development of public schools in Switzerland.</p><p>Despite his numerous accomplishments, Nägeli's personal life was marked by tragedy. He lost his first wife and several of his children to illness, and was left to raise his remaining children on his own. This personal loss, combined with his financial difficulties and ongoing struggles with depression, took a toll on Nägeli's physical and mental health. He died in 1836 at the age of 63, leaving behind a rich legacy in music, botany, education, and social reform.</p><p></p><p>
