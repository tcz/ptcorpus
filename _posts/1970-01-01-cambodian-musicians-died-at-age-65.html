(September 27, 1942		Siem Reap-March 30, 2008			New Brunswick)


was
a Cambodian
photojournalist and photographer.


					</p><p>Dith Pran was best known for his work as an interpreter and assistant for journalists covering the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in the 1970s, including for The New York Times. He famously coined the term "killing fields" to describe the sites where the Khmer Rouge executed and buried thousands of people. Pran's experiences under the regime, including being forced into hard labor and witnessing the deaths of family members, inspired the film "The Killing Fields," which won three Academy Awards in 1985. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, Pran worked as a human rights activist and founded the Dith Pran Holocaust Awareness Project to educate people about genocide. He was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1998 for his humanitarian work.</p><p>Prior to his work as a photojournalist, Dith Pran trained as a technician in Cambodia and served as a soldier during the Cambodian Civil War. When the Khmer Rouge came to power in 1975, Pran was forced to work in labor camps until he was able to escape and flee to Thailand in 1979. He then emigrated to the United States and became a staff photographer for The New York Times. In addition to his work with the Dith Pran Holocaust Awareness Project, he also served as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Despite facing many challenges as a refugee and survivor of the Khmer Rouge regime, Dith Pran remained committed to promoting human rights and raising awareness about genocide until his passing in 2008.</p><p>Dith Pran's legacy and impact on modern journalism are immeasurable. He remains a symbol of resilience, courage, and compassion in the face of unthinkable atrocities. In addition to his photography and humanitarian work, Pran also authored several books, including "Children of Cambodia's Killing Fields: Memoirs by Survivors," which provides firsthand accounts of the Khmer Rouge regime's victims. Pran's dedication to preserving the memory of those who perished during the regime is reflected in his powerful and moving memoir, "The Death and Life of Dith Pran," which was published posthumously in 2010. His story has inspired countless journalists, activists, and humanitarians worldwide to pursue truth, justice, and healing. Posthumously, Dith Pran was also awarded the title of Honorary Master of Arts by the University of Essex.</p><p></p><p>
