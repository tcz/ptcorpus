							Eric Campbell found fame as a comedic actor during the silent film era, known for his imposing size and physicality that made him an ideal foil for the equally boisterous Charlie Chaplin. Campbell began his career as a music hall performer before he was discovered by Chaplin in 1914, who brought him to America to work in his films. Campbell appeared in many of Chaplin's classic films, including "The Tramp" (1915), "The Immigrant" (1917) and "Easy Street" (1917). In addition to his work with Chaplin, Campbell also acted in films for other prominent directors such as D.W. Griffith and Hal Roach. Tragically, Campbell's life was cut short when he died in a car accident in 1917 at the age of 38. Despite his brief career, Campbell remains a beloved figure in the history of cinema, remembered for his physicality and charisma that helped him stand out even in a crowded field of comedic actors.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=15587344" title="Wikipedia article about Eric Campbell">Eric Campbell on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-indigestion.html' title='American actors died in Indigestion'><strong>American actors died in Indigestion</strong> List of the top 1 American actors who died in Indigestion</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actors-died-in-1957.html' title='Indian actors died in 1957'><strong>Indian actors died in 1957</strong> List of the top 3 Indian actors who died in 1957</a></li><li><a href='/belgian-actors-died-in-stroke.html' title='Belgian actors died in Stroke'><strong>Belgian actors died in Stroke</strong> List of the top 1 Belgian actors who died in Stroke</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-heart-ailment.html' title='American actors died in Heart Ailment'><strong>American actors died in Heart Ailment</strong> List of the top 21 American actors who died in Heart Ailment</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-musicians-died-at-age-68.html' title='Canadian musicians died at age 68'><strong>Canadian musicians died at age 68</strong> List of the top 25 Canadian music stars who died when they were 68</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-actors-died-in-1952.html' title='Austrian actors died in 1952'><strong>Austrian actors died in 1952</strong> List of the top 1 Austrian actors who died in 1952</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
