							Hrabal was a key figure in Czech literature, known for his experimental style and use of stream-of-consciousness narrative technique. He began his writing career in the 1950s, but it wasn't until the publication of his novel "Closely Watched Trains" in 1965 that he gained widespread recognition. The book was later adapted into an Academy Award-winning film in 1967. Hrabal continued to write prolifically throughout his life, often drawing on his own experiences as inspiration. He was also known for his love of cats and was often photographed with his feline companions. In addition to writing, Hrabal also worked as an actor in several Czech films, including "The Firemen's Ball" and "Closely Watched Trains". He died in 1997 after falling from a fifth-story window of a Prague hospital, but his legacy as a pioneering and influential Czech writer lives on to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=65130" title="Wikipedia article about Bohumil Hrabal">Bohumil Hrabal on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/austrian-actors-died-in-2011.html' title='Austrian actors died in 2011'><strong>Austrian actors died in 2011</strong> List of the top 6 Austrian actors who died in 2011</a></li><li><a href='/polish-musicians-died-at-age-29.html' title='Polish musicians died at age 29'><strong>Polish musicians died at age 29</strong> List of the top 3 Polish music stars who died when they were 29</a></li><li><a href='/cypriot-actors-died-before-turning-20.html' title='Cypriot actors died before turning 20'><strong>Cypriot actors died before turning 20</strong> List of the top 2 Cypriot actors who died before they turned 20</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/french-actors-died-at-age-76.html' title='French actors died at age 76'><strong>French actors died at age 76</strong> List of the top 19 French actors who died when they were 76</a></li><li><a href='/norwegian-musicians-died-in-stomach-cancer.html' title='Norwegian musicians died in Stomach cancer'><strong>Norwegian musicians died in Stomach cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Norwegian music stars who died in Stomach cancer</a></li><li><a href='/german-actors-in-vienna.html' title='German actors in Vienna'><strong>German actors in Vienna</strong> List of the top 9 German actors who live in or lived in Vienna</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
