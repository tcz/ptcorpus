(January 25, 1627		Lismore Castle-December 31, 1691			Kingdom of England)


was
an Irish
physicist, philosopher and chemist.


					</p><p>He is known as one of the founders of modern chemistry and is famous for Boyle's Law, which describes the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas. He was a prolific writer, publishing over 60 works in his lifetime, including "The Sceptical Chymist" and "The Usefulness of Natural Philosophy". Boyle was also heavily involved in the Royal Society, serving as its president from 1680 to 1682. His contributions to science have had a lasting impact and have earned him the nickname, "The Father of Chemistry".</p><p>Boyle was born into an aristocratic family in Ireland and was the 7th son to Richard Boyle, the Earl of Cork. He was homeschooled by private tutors before attending Eton College in England. Boyle later returned to Ireland and inherited his father's estate, where he established his own private laboratory. He conducted numerous experiments in his laboratory, including ones on the properties of gases and the properties of air. He is also credited with the discovery of several chemical elements, including sulfuric acid.</p><p>Boyle was a deeply religious man and believed that understanding the natural world was a way to better understand God's creation. He saw science not as a threat to religion, but as a way to prove the existence of God. He held that there was a natural law that governed the universe, which he called the "mechanical philosophy". This philosophy held that the universe was like a giant machine, with each part functioning according to the laws of physics.</p><p>In addition to his scientific pursuits, Boyle was also a philanthropist, donating much of his income to fund the education of the poor. His legacy lives on today, not only in the scientific community but also in the Boyle Medal, which is awarded by the Royal Dublin Society for scientific research of exceptional merit.</p><p>Boyle was also interested in medicine and made substantial contributions to the field. He conducted experiments on blood transfusions, which were crucial in the development of the modern practice. Boyle also had a keen interest in the improvement of navigation instruments, and he designed a sophisticated water pump for use on ships. In addition, he invented the "repeating" watch, which was a significant innovation in timekeeping.</p><p>Boyle never married and lived with his sister, Katherine, for most of his life. He was known for his simple and modest lifestyle, despite his wealth and status. Boyle also had a close friendship with fellow scientist, Isaac Newton, and the two shared ideas and corresponded frequently.</p><p>Boyle's scientific contributions sparked a revolution in the field of chemistry and established the basis for modern science. His legacy continues to inspire scientific research and discovery, over three hundred years after his passing.</p><p>Boyle's legacy includes not only his influential scientific work but also his contributions to the English language. He is credited with coining several terms that are still in use today, such as "analysis", "electrolysis", and "combustion". Boyle was also interested in alchemy, an early precursor to chemistry, and his pursuit of alchemical transmutation led him to develop new methods for purifying chemicals. These methods laid the groundwork for modern analytical chemistry. </p><p>In his later years, Boyle suffered from poor health, eventually losing his sight. Despite this, he continued to pursue his scientific work and even developed a system of writing that could be read by touch, allowing him to continue correspondence with other scientists. Boyle died in his sleep at the age of 64 and was buried in St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London. His scientific achievements and philosophical views continue to be studied and admired by scientists and scholars all over the world.</p><p>Boyle was also a strong advocate for the scientific method, which emphasized the importance of experimentation and observation in scientific inquiry. He believed that theories should be based on empirical evidence and that experiments should be designed to test hypotheses. Boyle also believed that knowledge should be shared and collaborated upon, rather than kept secret or hidden away. This ideal was reflected in his founding of the Royal Society, which was established as a way to promote scientific research and discovery. </p><p>Boyle's influence on science and philosophy extended beyond his own time. His work had a significant impact on the development of the Enlightenment, a period of intellectual enlightenment in the 18th century that emphasized reason, scientific discovery, and individualism. Boyle's emphasis on empirical evidence and experimentation helped to shape the scientific method as it is practiced today. His legacy also extends to the field of economics, as he was instrumental in popularizing the concept of supply and demand in economics through his work on the pricing of commodities. </p><p>In addition to his scientific and philosophical achievements, Boyle was also a dedicated Christian who was deeply devoted to his faith. He believed that science and religion could coexist harmoniously and that the study of the natural world could bring people closer to God. Boyle's scientific work was motivated by his desire to understand the world as a manifestation of God's creation. He also believed that scientific discoveries could help to reveal God's divine plan for humanity. </p><p>Overall, Boyle's contributions to science, philosophy, and religion were multifaceted and profound. His work has had a lasting impact on numerous fields of study and continues to be celebrated and studied to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(November 8, 1847		Clontarf, Dublin-April 20, 1912			London)

	
		otherwise known as Abraham Stoker

	
was
an Irish
novelist and writer.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Noel Thornley Stoker.

						</p><p>Stoker is best known for his seminal work "Dracula", which was published in 1897. The novel helped establish the modern vampire genre of fiction and inspired countless adaptations in film, television, and other media. Before achieving success with "Dracula", Stoker worked as a theater manager and as an assistant to the famous actor Sir Henry Irving. He also wrote several other novels, short stories, and non-fiction works throughout his career. Stoker was a prolific writer and remained active until his death at the age of 64. His contributions to horror fiction and the popular culture of vampires continue to influence and inspire writers and audiences today.</p><p>Stoker was educated at Trinity College in Dublin and later worked as a civil servant. He began his writing career as a theater critic and later became involved in writing stage plays. Stoker's interest in horror and the supernatural became evident in his early works, such as "The Crystal Cup" and "The Chain of Destiny". His experience in the theater industry and his friendship with Sir Henry Irving helped shape his writing style and contributed to his success as a novelist.</p><p>Although "Dracula" is widely regarded as Stoker's literary masterpiece, he also wrote other notable works, such as "The Lady of the Shroud", "The Lair of the White Worm", and "The Jewel of Seven Stars". Stoker was also a public figure and a member of the literary and artistic circles in London during his time there. He was associated with the Lyceum Theatre, where Irving performed, and was friends with other prominent writers such as Oscar Wilde.</p><p>Stoker's legacy has continued to grow in the decades since his death. His impact on the horror genre and popular culture is undeniable, as evidenced by the numerous adaptations of "Dracula" and other vampire stories. Stoker's influence can be seen in the works of contemporary writers, filmmakers, and artists who continue to explore the themes of horror, desire, and the supernatural. Today, Stoker is remembered as one of the most iconic and influential figures in the history of horror literature.</p><p>Despite the accolades earned by his most famous novel, Bram Stoker initially received mixed reviews for "Dracula" upon its release. However, it became more popular as the years passed, and today it is considered one of the most important works in the horror genre. Stoker's inspiration for the novel came partially from his travels throughout Europe, where he researched Romanian folklore and vampire legends. He also drew on his own experiences working in the theater industry, incorporating elements of drama and suspense into the story. In addition to his writing, Stoker was an accomplished athlete, playing football (soccer), and participating in long-distance running events. He was once a member of the Dublin Athletics Club and even competed in the first ever Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, where he represented Ireland in the event of weight throwing.</p><p>Stoker's life and legacy have been subject to much discussion and speculation over the years. Some scholars have explored potential homoerotic themes in his writing, drawing connections between his work and the cultural milieu of same-sex desire in Victorian England. Others have analyzed his use of folklore and mythology, highlighting the ways in which Stoker's stories reflect larger cultural anxieties about identity, representation, and otherness. Despite the diversity of interpretations, however, the enduring popularity of "Dracula" and Stoker's other works attests to the powerful resonance of his storytelling and imagination. Today, Stoker remains an iconic figure in the pantheon of horror literature, beloved by fans of all ages and backgrounds.</p><p>Stoker's death was a tragedy for his loved ones, but his legacy lives on to this day. In addition to his literary achievements, Stoker was also a philanthropist and a dedicated family man. He was an advocate for women's rights and social justice, and he supported numerous charities throughout his life. Stoker's descendants continue to honor his memory and contributions to society, and his impact on popular culture shows no signs of waning. Today, fans of horror and fantasy continue to celebrate his iconic works and draw inspiration from his vivid imagination and storytelling skills. Bram Stoker's life and work serve as a testament to the power of the written word to capture the essence of human experience and transcend time and place.</p><p></p><p>

		a.k.a. Edward De Groot or Edward Stanelli

	
was
an Irish
actor.


					</p><p>He began his acting career on the English stage before moving to Hollywood in the 1930s. Stanelli appeared in over 50 films throughout his career, playing a variety of roles ranging from supporting characters to leading men. He often played characters with a European accent, utilizing his own multilingual background to add authenticity to his performances. In addition to his work on stage and screen, Stanelli was also a talented musician and composer, creating scores for films such as Charlie Chan at Treasure Island and The Lady from Shanghai. Despite being a prolific and successful actor, Stanelli is relatively unknown today, perhaps due to the fact that he often played uncredited or small roles in popular films of the time.</p><p>However, Stanelliâs contributions to the film industry were significant. He was known for his versatility and ability to play a wide range of characters, from villains to romantic leads. Some of his notable film roles include The Thin Man, The Big Store, and the Marx Brothers' film Room Service. Stanelli also appeared in several television shows, such as The Adventures of Robin Hood and The Lone Ranger, during the 1950s. </p><p>Aside from his talents on the big and small screens, Stanelli was also a skilled musician. He played several musical instruments, including the piano, mandolin, and accordion, and often incorporated these skills into his performances. In fact, he even composed music for several films throughout his career, showcasing his diverse range of talents.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Stanelli passed away in relative obscurity in 1961. However, his influence can still be felt in the film industry today, particularly in the use of multilingual actors and musicians to add authenticity to performances.</p><p>Stanelli was born as Edward de Groot in Dublin, Ireland, to a Dutch father and Irish mother. He later changed his name to the more marketable "Stanelli" when he began performing on stage. He began his career in entertainment as a musician, playing in bands and orchestras in both Britain and America. However, it wasn't until he began acting that he found real success. </p><p>In Hollywood, Stanelli quickly made a name for himself as a character actor. He often played ethnic stereotypes, such as Italian or Russian immigrants, but he also had the ability to play more complex roles.

He was a versatile and talented performer who left his mark on Hollywood during the golden age of cinema.</p><p>Despite his success in the entertainment industry, Stanelli faced significant obstacles and discrimination as a result of his multicultural background. He often struggled to find roles that accurately represented his ethnic background, and he was frequently typecast in roles that relied on broad stereotypes and caricatures. Additionally, he faced discrimination due to his Jewish heritage and was forced to change his surname to Stanelli to avoid anti-Semitic backlash.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Stanelli remained a dedicated and passionate performer throughout his career. He continued to push the boundaries of representation in film and music, and he inspired countless young performers with his innovative and ambitious approach to performance. Today, he continues to be remembered as a pioneering figure in the entertainment industry, whose legacy has inspired generations of performers to pursue their dreams and break down barriers of discrimination and prejudice.</p><p>Stanelli was known for his unique look, with his slicked-back hair and strongly defined facial features. His distinctive appearance often helped him stand out on screen, and he used it to great effect in roles that required him to play tough or menacing characters. Despite his success as an actor, however, Stanelli continued to see himself as a musician first and foremost. He once stated in an interview that he felt he was "an actor by chance, but a musician by natural inclination."</p><p>One of Stanelli's most notable film roles was in the 1936 comedy My Man Godfrey, starring William Powell and Carole Lombard. Stanelli played Carlo, the family's Italian chauffeur who dreams of one day starting his own restaurant. In a memorable scene, Carlo serenades the heroine (played by Lombard) with a mandolin, singing a romantic Italian song as she gazes at him smitten.</p><p>Throughout his career, Stanelli worked with some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including the Marx Brothers, Clark Gable, and Barbara Stanwyck. He was also known for his collaborations with director Orson Welles, appearing in two of his films: The Lady from Shanghai and Touch of Evil. In The Lady from Shanghai, Stanelli not only acted but also composed the film's score, using his musical talents to help create the film's suspenseful and dreamlike atmosphere.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced as a result of his ethnicity and background, Stanelli remained dedicated to his craft and to breaking down barriers in the entertainment industry. He once said in an interview, "I want to be remembered as someone who tried to do his best, who tried to do good work, who tried to be a decent human being."</p><p></p><p>

					</p><p>He served as a captain in the British Army during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and was awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery in the Siege of Lucknow. After retiring from the military, Boulger became involved in politics and was elected to the Irish Parliament in 1885. He was a strong advocate for Irish Home Rule and worked closely with Charles Stewart Parnell. Boulger also wrote several books, including a memoir of his experiences in India. Despite his successful military and political careers, he faced personal tragedy when his wife and two of his children died in a house fire in 1888.</p><p>In addition to his military and political careers and his writing, Boulger was also an accomplished athlete. He was a skilled horseman and won several races as a jockey, and he also competed in amateur boxing matches. Boulger was known for his strong sense of duty and his fierce loyalty to his country and causes, even when it cost him personal relationships and financial stability. Despite his accomplishments, however, he remained relatively unknown outside of Ireland until the publication of his memoirs in the early 20th century, which helped to secure his place in Irish history as a hero and a champion of Irish independence.</p><p>Boulger's military career began at an early age when he joined the British Army at the age of 18. He quickly rose through the ranks due to his dedication and discipline, eventually becoming an officer in the Bengal Horse Artillery. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Boulger was stationed in Lucknow, where he played a key role in defending the city against the rebels. He was wounded multiple times during the siege, but refused to leave his post and continued to lead his troops with valor until the end.</p><p>After retiring from the military, Boulger turned his attention to politics. He was a firm believer in Irish Home Rule and devoted his life to promoting the cause. He joined the Irish Parliamentary Party and served as its treasurer for many years. Boulger worked closely with Parnell, who led the movement for Irish independence, and was a key figure in the party's efforts to secure a greater degree of self-rule for Ireland.</p><p>In addition to his political and military accomplishments, Boulger was also an avid sportsman. He was a skilled horseman and competed in horse races across Ireland and England, often winning prestigious events such as the Grand National. He was also a passionate amateur boxer and participated in many matches throughout his life.</p><p>Despite facing personal tragedies and setbacks, Boulger remained steadfast in his beliefs and continued to fight for Irish independence until his death in 1900. He left an enduring legacy as a hero and a champion of Irish freedom, and his contributions to Irish history remain celebrated to this day.</p><p>Boulger's life was not without controversy, however. His involvement in the Irish Parliamentary Party was called into question when it was revealed that he had privately expressed doubts about Parnell's leadership. Boulger was accused of undermining the party's efforts to achieve Home Rule, and some questioned his loyalty to the cause. Nevertheless, Boulger remained influential within the party and continued to fight for Irish independence until his death.</p><p>In addition to his political and military pursuits, Boulger was also a passionate scholar of history and literature. He was fluent in several languages, including French, German, and Arabic, and was known for his extensive knowledge of Irish mythology and folklore. He published several works on these topics, including a study of ancient Irish poetry.</p><p>Today, Boulger is remembered as one of Ireland's most distinguished heroes. His courage and dedication during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and his tireless efforts on behalf of Irish independence have earned him a place in Irish history as a true patriot and champion of freedom.</p><p>Boulger's Victoria Cross, which he earned during the Siege of Lucknow, is now on display at the Imperial War Museum in London. In addition to his military honors, Boulger was also awarded the Royal Humane Society's medal for bravery and the Turkish Crimean War medal for his service during the Crimean War.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Boulger's personal life was marked by tragedy. In addition to the loss of his wife and two children in the house fire, several of his other children died young. Boulger also suffered from financial difficulties later in life due to his devotion to Irish Home Rule, which often required him to spend his own money to support the cause.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Boulger remained steadfast in his commitment to serving his country and fighting for Irish independence. His legacy continues to inspire generations of Irish patriots and his contributions to Irish history are remembered and celebrated to this day.</p><p></p><p>
