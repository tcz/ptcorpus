									</h1><p>Here are 1 famous musicians from Bangladesh died at 30:</p><h2>Ahmed Rajib Haider</h2><p><strong>Ahmed Rajib Haider</strong>
(April 5, 1982-February 15, 2013)


was
a Bangladeshi
personality.


					</p><p>He was known for his activism in promoting free speech and secularism in Bangladesh. Haider was a prominent blogger and a vocal critic of Islamist extremist groups. He played an important role in organizing protests against the conviction and death sentence of several leaders of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party for war crimes committed during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. However, Haider's activism brought him into the crosshairs of Islamist extremists, and he was brutally murdered in front of his house in Dhaka in 2013. The murder sparked widespread protests and condemnations from across the world, and brought attention to the rising threat of religious extremism in Bangladesh.</p><p>Prior to his death, Ahmed Rajib Haider was an architect by profession who had completed his Master's degree in architecture from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). He was also an avid writer and had a popular blog under the pseudonym 'Thaba Baba'. Through his blog, he actively advocated for free speech, human rights, and against religious extremism in Bangladesh. Haider had a strong presence on social media, particularly on Facebook, where he would share his opinions and engage in discussions with his followers. Despite receiving numerous death threats from Islamic extremist groups, he did not back down from his activism and continued to speak out against fundamentalism. Haider's murder caused a surge in the number of bloggers fleeing Bangladesh due to fear of being targeted by religious extremist groups. His legacy continues to inspire many in Bangladesh to stand up for their beliefs and advocate for the rights of all people.</p><p>Haider's murder also brought attention to the serious issue of cyber attacks against bloggers and activists in Bangladesh. Prior to his death, he had been targeted by a group of hackers who had infiltrated his Facebook account and posted derogatory messages. This cyber attack was just one of many that were being carried out against individuals who spoke out against religious extremism in the country. In the aftermath of Haider's murder, the government of Bangladesh came under heavy criticism for failing to protect its citizens from violence and for not doing more to combat religious extremism. The incident also led to renewed calls for stronger international action against groups that promote hatred and intolerance. Despite the tragedy of his untimely death, Ahmed Rajib Haider remains a prominent figure in Bangladesh's struggle for free speech and human rights, and his legacy continues to inspire others to speak out against bigotry and extremism.</p><p>Following Haider's murder, several people were arrested and charged with his killing. In December 2015, a special tribunal sentenced two members of the banned extremist group Ansarullah Bangla Team to death for their involvement in the murder. Four other men received prison sentences ranging from five years to life. The verdict was widely applauded for sending a strong message that violence against protesters and activists would not be tolerated in Bangladesh. However, human rights organizations criticized the trials for several irregularities, including allegations of torture and forced confessions of the accused. Despite these criticisms, Haider's murder remains a milestone event in Bangladesh's ongoing battle against religious extremism and the push for greater freedoms and democracy.</p><p></p><p>
