						musicians died when they were
						32
									</h1><p>Here are 4 famous musicians from Italy died at 32:</p><h2>Giuseppe Zangara</h2><p><strong>Giuseppe Zangara</strong>
(September 7, 1900		Ferruzzano-March 20, 1933			Union Correctional Institution)


was
an Italian
bricklayer.


					</p><p>Giuseppe Zangara gained notoriety for his attempted assassination of then-president-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 15, 1933. Zangara was targeting Roosevelt, but ended up wounding five people, including Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who eventually succumbed to his injuries. Zangara was quickly apprehended and sentenced to death. During his trial, Zangara claimed that he had been trying to kill any president, not just Roosevelt, and that he was motivated to do so by his chronic stomach pains. Despite widespread public sympathy for his suffering, Zangara was executed by electric chair less than a month after his arrest.</p><p>Giuseppe Zangara was born in a small village in Italy and immigrated to the United States in 1923. He settled in Patterson, New Jersey, where he worked as a bricklayer. Zangara struggled with poverty and was often unable to afford medical treatment for his chronic stomach pains. He believed that his suffering was the result of the capitalist system and became increasingly radicalized, leading to his assassination attempt on Roosevelt. </p><p>Zangara's actions highlighted the security vulnerabilities of political figures and led to the Secret Service's increased involvement in protecting presidents. Cermak's death resulted in changes to security protocols for political events. </p><p>Despite his short-lived notoriety, Zangara remains a relatively obscure figure in history. However, his actions serve as a reminder of how political violence can be fueled by personal struggles and beliefs.</p><p>Zangara's execution was witnessed by a reporter from the Chicago Tribune, who famously remarked that "nobody cheered, nobody prayed, nobody cried. There was only silence." Zangara's body was later returned to Italy, where his family was initially denied permission to bury him. Eventually, his body was buried in his hometown of Ferruzzano. The incident also led to a conspiracy theory that Cermak was the intended target and Roosevelt was an accidental victim, but this theory has been widely debunked. In addition to the increased security measures put in place after the incident, Zangara's attempted assassination also prompted a discussion about the need for healthcare reform in the United States. Today, Zangara is often remembered as a tragic figure whose actions were driven by desperation and illness.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of capital punishment.

(January 13, 1836		Naples-February 21, 1868			Florence)


was
an Italian
personality.


					</p><p>Giuseppe Abbati was an Italian painter associated with the Macchiaioli movement. He was a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence and his style was influenced by Realism, Impressionism, and the works of the Dutch painter, Jacob Maris. Abbati was known for his landscapes, portraits, and history paintings. He traveled extensively and often depicted scenes from his travels. His work was exhibited at the Paris Salon and the International Exhibition of Berlin. Despite his short life, Abbati was a significant figure in 19th-century Italian art.</p><p>In addition to his painting career, Giuseppe Abbati was also a writer and art critic. He contributed to several art publications, including "Il Politecnico" and "L'Arte Italiana." Abbati was a central figure in the Macchiaioli movement, which was a group of artists who rejected the traditional academic style of painting and chose to work outdoors in natural light. He was also friends with the Italian painter Giovanni Fattori, who was another prominent member of the Macchiaioli movement. Abbati's work can be seen in several museums throughout Italy, including the Uffizi Gallery in Florence and the Museo Civico in Pisa. Despite his short career, he left an indelible mark on Italian art and continues to be celebrated for his contributions to the Macchiaioli movement.</p><p>During his lifetime, Giuseppe Abbati was regarded as a talented and innovative artist who produced some of the most significant artworks of the 19th century. His contribution to the Macchiaioli movement was instrumental in changing the course of Italian art, as the movement paved the way for modernism in the country. He was also known for his skill as a teacher and trained several artists who went on to become famous in their own right.</p><p>Abbati's early works were characterized by a deep interest in Realism, and he often painted landscapes and scenes of everyday life. However, during his travels to Paris and the Netherlands, his style evolved, and he began to experiment with Impressionism. This can be seen in his later works, which were marked by a more fluid and expressive style.</p><p>Despite his achievements, Abbati's life was cut short due to an unfortunate incident. In 1868, he was bitten by a dog and contracted rabies, which led to his untimely death at the age of 32. Nevertheless, his legacy lived on, and he continues to be remembered as one of Italy's most important painters and art critics.</p><p></p><p>
