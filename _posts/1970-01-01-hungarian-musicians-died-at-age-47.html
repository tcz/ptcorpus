(July 1, 1818		Buda-August 13, 1865			Vienna)

	
		also known as Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis

	
was
a Hungarian
physician and scientist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his discovery of the medical procedure that is now known as handwashing. Semmelweis was one of the pioneers of antiseptic procedures and his work greatly improved the hygiene of hospitals and medical facilities. His observations of the high mortality rates of childbirth in hospitals led him to research the causes of puerperal fever. Semmelweis’ theories were not immediately accepted by the medical community and he faced significant challenges in getting his work recognized. Despite this, his legacy has lived on and his contributions to the field of medicine have saved countless lives. He died at the age of 47 in a mental institution, where he was wrongly committed after his colleagues rejected his work.</p><p>Semmelweis graduated from the University of Vienna with a degree in medicine in 1844. After completing his studies, he began working at the Vienna General Hospital where he observed the high mortality rates of women due to puerperal fever. He conducted numerous experiments and made observations, which eventually led him to conclude that puerperal fever was caused by the transfer of infectious material from a healthcare worker's hands to a patient's body. He implemented strict handwashing protocols for physicians and medical students, which led to a significant reduction in mortality rates. Despite his success, Semmelweis faced ridicule and opposition from the medical community, who were slow to accept his findings. It wasn't until after his death that his ideas became widely accepted and integrated into medical hygiene practices. Semmelweis has since been recognized as a pioneer in the field of antiseptic procedures, saving countless lives with his contributions to medicine.</p><p>Semmelweis's work also had a significant impact on the development of germ theory, which led to the development of modern medical practices. Prior to his discoveries, it was not widely recognized that medical procedures could actually transmit infectious diseases. Semmelweis's hand-washing protocol was a simple and effective solution to a problem that had puzzled medical professionals for centuries. Today, Semmelweis is widely recognized as a hero in the medical field, and his legacy continues through the work of the many healthcare professionals who strive to keep themselves and their patients safe from infection. His life and accomplishments are a testament to the power of medical research and dedication to improving public health.</p><p>In addition to his work in promoting hand hygiene and antiseptic procedures, Semmelweis also made significant contributions to the understanding of childbirth and the female reproductive system. He was one of the first physicians to recognize the importance of hygiene and cleanliness during childbirth, and his work helped to reduce mortality rates for both mothers and infants. Semmelweis also introduced the use of forceps during delivery, which greatly improved the safety of childbirth. He also conducted research on the causes of syphilis, and through his work, he was able to develop a more effective treatment for the disease.</p><p>Despite his many contributions to medicine and public health, Semmelweis faced significant challenges throughout his career. He was often criticized and ridiculed by his colleagues, and his ideas were initially met with skepticism and disbelief. His mental health suffered as a result of the stress and pressure he faced, and he ultimately died in a mental institution. Today, Semmelweis is remembered as a brilliant and innovative physician whose work has saved countless lives and revolutionized the field of medicine.</p><p></p><p>

(September 13, 1898		Budapest-March 29, 1946			Budapest)


was
a Hungarian
politician.


					</p><p>László Baky was a member of the fascist Arrow Cross Party and served as the Interior Minister during World War II when Hungary was under Nazi occupation. He was responsible for many of the atrocities committed by the Arrow Cross regime, including the deportation of Hungarian Jews to concentration camps. After the war, Baky was arrested and tried for war crimes. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging, which was carried out on March 29, 1946.</p><p>During his time as Interior Minister, Baky was known for his brutal tactics and played a key role in the Arrow Cross Party's rise to power. He played a role in suppressing opposition parties and censoring the media. In collaboration with the Nazis, he oversaw the deportation of over 400,000 Hungarian Jews to concentration camps, where the vast majority were killed. Baky himself was an anti-Semite and often used anti-Semitic rhetoric in his speeches.</p><p>After Hungary was liberated by the Soviet Union in 1945, Baky was arrested and charged with war crimes along with other high-ranking members of the Arrow Cross Party. He was tried and found guilty by a Hungarian court, along with other prominent figures such as Ferenc Szálasi, the leader of the Arrow Cross Party. Baky was executed on March 29, 1946, along with two other high-ranking members of the Arrow Cross Party, Gábor Vajna and József Gera. Their executions were carried out in front of a large crowd in Budapest as a warning to others who might contemplate similar actions.</p><p>Baky's actions during World War II will always be remembered as some of the most egregious and horrific crimes committed by any leader in Hungary's history. Despite his brutal tactics and extremist views, Baky remained a staunch fascist until the end of his life, refusing to acknowledge the atrocities he committed. His trial and execution represented a turning point for Hungary, as the country began to come to terms with its role in the Holocaust and the brutal legacy of far-right politics. Today, Baky is seen as a cautionary tale, a reminder of the dangers of fascism and extremism, and a symbol of the resilience of democracy and human rights.</p><p>Baky's political career began in the 1930s when he joined the pro-Nazi Hungarian National Socialist Party. He rose quickly through the ranks, becoming a member of the national assembly in 1939. During this time, he developed a reputation as a hardliner and was often involved in physical altercations with opposition politicians.</p><p>After the German invasion of Hungary in 1944, Baky joined the Arrow Cross Party and was appointed as interior minister by Ferenc Szálasi, who had been installed as the country's leader. As interior minister, Baky oversaw the establishment of pro-Nazi organizations and paramilitary groups, as well as the implementation of anti-Semitic laws and policies.</p><p>One of Baky's most notorious actions was his role in the so-called "Arrow Cross reign of terror," during which thousands of Jews and other minorities were rounded up and executed in the streets of Budapest. Baky was also responsible for the forced deportation of Hungarian Jews to concentration camps, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>Despite his crimes, Baky remained unrepentant to the end. In his final statement before his execution, he declared that he was a loyal servant of his country and that he had acted in accordance with his convictions. His legacy remains deeply controversial in Hungary, where some far-right groups continue to venerate him as a hero.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by hanging.

He quickly made a name for himself on stage and in Hollywood, appearing in films such as "The Mark of Zorro" and "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm".

Today, Bromberg is remembered not only for his contributions to the performing arts, but also for his humanitarian efforts and activism during a tumultuous period in history.</p><p>After Bromberg's death, his widow Marie successfully sued the University of California for medical malpractice, alleging that its negligence had contributed to his death. She claimed that Bromberg had been receiving treatment for a liver ailment at the university hospital, and that his health had been further compromised after he was given an incorrect injection. The case became a cause célèbre and was widely covered by the media, as it raised questions about the quality of medical care provided by university hospitals. The incident also led to changes in the way that medical staff were trained and supervised, with a greater emphasis placed on accountability and patient safety. Bromberg's legacy continues to be celebrated in the performing arts, and he is remembered as a versatile actor and a champion of social justice.</p><p></p><p>
