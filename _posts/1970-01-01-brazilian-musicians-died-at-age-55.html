His work led to the development of new treatments and prevention strategies for these illnesses.</p><p>In addition to his research, Chagas was also a dedicated public health activist.

His research and advocacy have made a significant impact on public health both in Brazil and around the world.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and medical contributions, Carlos Chagas also played an important role in Brazilian politics. He served as the director of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, a leading public health research institution in Brazil, and as a member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences. Chagas was also an outspoken critic of the discrimination and inequality faced by Indigenous people in Brazil. He advocated for their rights and helped establish the Indian Protection Service in 1910, which aimed to protect the interests and wellbeing of Indigenous communities. Today, the Carlos Chagas Medal is given out annually by the Brazilian National Academy of Medicine to recognize outstanding contributions in the field of tropical medicine.
