(July 12, 1923		La Plata-July 29, 2000			Buenos Aires)

	
		a.k.a. Rene Favaloro or Dr. René Favaloro

	
was
an Argentine
physician, scientist and surgeon.


					</p><p>René Favaloro is mostly known for creating the Favaloro Foundation, a non-profit organization that provided free medical care to those in need. Before creating the foundation, Favaloro founded the Favaloro University in Buenos Aires, where he worked as a professor of surgery. He was a pioneer in heart surgery and made several important contributions to the field, including the development of the technique of aortocoronary bypass surgery, also known as coronary artery bypass surgery. In addition to his work in medicine, Favaloro was a strong advocate for social justice and was critical of the economic policies of the Argentine government, which eventually led to the financial struggles of his foundation. His death drew attention to the need for greater support for non-profit organizations and healthcare in Argentina.</p><p>René Favaloro was born in a small town near La Plata, Argentina. He was the son of Italian immigrants who had come to Argentina in search of a better life. After completing his medical degree at the National University of La Plata, Favaloro worked as a rural doctor in the Argentine countryside. He then moved to Buenos Aires, where he specialized in cardiology and went on to study heart surgery at the prestigious Cleveland Clinic in the United States.</p><p>Upon returning to Argentina, Favaloro founded the Favaloro Foundation in 1992, which quickly became renowned for its innovative approach to healthcare. The Foundation was intended to be financially self-sustainable, but the Argentine economic crisis of the late 1990s led to its financial collapse. Favaloro made a last-ditch plea to the Argentine government for support but was denied, leading to his decision to take his own life at the age of 77.</p><p>Favaloro's legacy lives on through his contributions to medical science and his commitment to helping those in need. The Favaloro Foundation still operates today, providing medical care and research opportunities to the Argentine community. Favaloro's life and work remain an inspiration to many in the healthcare community and beyond.</p><p>Favaloro had a strong passion for education and believed that every person should have access to higher education regardless of their financial situation. He implemented free education initiatives at his university and often provided scholarships to students in need. Favaloro was also an author and published several books on cardiology and heart surgery. In addition to his work in medicine, Favaloro was a skilled pilot and enjoyed flying small planes in his spare time. He was also an avid sports fan and supporter of the Argentine football team, Boca Juniors. Favaloro received numerous awards and honors throughout his career, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom from former US President Bill Clinton in 1996.</p><p>Despite Favaloro's achievements in medicine and healthcare, he was known for his humility and compassion for others. He treated all of his patients with kindness and respect, regardless of their social status or financial resources. Favaloro's commitment to social justice extended beyond the healthcare field; he was also an advocate for environmental conservation and spoke out against deforestation in Argentina. In addition, he was a critic of corruption within the government and medical industry. Favaloro's suicide was a tragic loss to the medical community and the Argentine people, but his legacy continues to inspire generations of healthcare professionals and advocates for human rights.</p><p>After Favaloro's death, tributes poured in from all over the world, and he was widely mourned in Argentina as a hero and champion of the people. The Argentine government declared three days of national mourning in his honor, and tens of thousands of people attended his funeral in Buenos Aires. In 2003, the Argentine government issued a postage stamp in Favaloro's honor, and in 2013, the city of La Plata unveiled a statue of him in recognition of his contributions to medicine and social justice. </p><p>Favaloro's life and work have been the subject of several books, documentaries, and films, including the documentary "El Camino de San René" (The Road of Saint René), which tells the story of his life and work. His legacy continues to influence the medical community in Argentina and around the world, and the Favaloro Foundation remains a testament to his ongoing commitment to social justice and healthcare for all.</p><p></p><p>

an Argentine
writer and journalist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his contributions to education in Argentina, serving as the seventh president of the country from 1868-1874.

He also founded the National Library and National University of San Juan. As a writer and journalist, Sarmiento was a vocal opponent of the Juan Manuel de Rosas regime, and his critical writings helped to advance the ideas of liberalism and democracy. Sarmiento was a key figure in Argentine intellectual and cultural life during the 19th century and his legacy continues to influence Argentine politics and society to this day.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to education and literature, Sarmiento was also involved in politics. He played a key role in the modernization of Argentina during his presidency, promoting infrastructure projects such as railway construction and communication networks. Sarmiento also pursued diplomatic relations with other countries in South America and was a strong advocate for regional cooperation. After leaving office, he continued to be active in politics as a senator and ambassador to the United States. Sarmiento is remembered as a major figure in the development of modern Argentina and his legacy has had a lasting impact on the country's cultural and intellectual life. A number of important institutions, including schools, libraries, and universities, bear his name today.</p><p>Sarmiento was born in a family of modest means and he faced numerous obstacles in his early life. His father died when he was only six years old, and he was forced to work as a rural laborer to make ends meet. However, he had a passion for learning and received his education through unconventional means, such as reading books and attending a makeshift school. Sarmiento's dedication to education grew as he entered adulthood and he became a firm believer that education was the key to national progress.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to Argentina, Sarmiento was well-respected internationally.

His works continue to be studied by scholars and students alike and are regarded as some of the most important works in Argentine literature.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Sarmiento faced opposition and criticism during his presidency. His policies, which often prioritized modernization and economic growth over social welfare, were not universally well-received. Nevertheless, his legacy as a champion of education and progressive values has endured and he is revered as a national hero in Argentina.</p><p>Sarmiento was also a passionate advocate for women's rights and gender equality, a position that was ahead of its time. He believed that educating women was essential to achieving social progress and actively encouraged the education of girls, which was uncommon in Argentina during the 19th century. His efforts paved the way for the advancement of women's rights in Argentina and his ideas continue to inspire feminist movements in the country today.</p><p>In his later years, Sarmiento suffered from health problems and political isolation, but he never lost his commitment to public service and intellectual pursuits. He continued to write and publish, and his contributions to Argentine culture and politics were celebrated even after his death. Today, there are numerous monuments and memorials dedicated to him throughout Argentina, including the National Museum of Historical Studies, which was founded in his honor.</p><p>Sarmiento's impact on education went beyond Argentina, as his ideas and methods were adopted by other countries in Latin America. He also advocated for the rights of indigenous peoples and their integration into society, and wrote extensively on the subject. Sarmiento was a passionate promoter of science and technology, and he believed that they were essential for the progress of society. He founded the Department of Physical and Natural Sciences at the National University of Buenos Aires, and encouraged the development of the country's scientific and technological infrastructure.</p><p>Sarmiento's personal life was marked by tragedy and adversity. He lost two of his children to illness, and his wife died in a shipwreck while traveling to join him in Europe. He also faced political persecution and exile during his lifetime. Despite these challenges, Sarmiento remained committed to his vision of a modern and progressive Argentina, and his legacy continues to be celebrated in the country today. Sarmiento's contributions to education, literature, politics, and social progress have made him a towering figure in Argentine history and one of the most important intellectual and cultural figures in Latin America.</p><p></p><p>

(June 1, 1874		Buenos Aires-February 10, 1952)


was
an Argentine
writer.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the most important figures in Argentine and Latin American literature, despite having only published a small number of works during his lifetime. Fernández was known for his innovative and experimental writing style, which often explored themes of identity, memory, and time. He was also a notable teacher and mentor to many younger writers who went on to become major figures in the Latin American literary scene, including Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares. Despite his influence on Argentine literature, Fernández was largely unknown outside of literary circles until after his death, when his work began to receive more widespread recognition and critical attention.</p><p>Fernández grew up in a politically and culturally vibrant household. His father was a lawyer and journalist who helped found the Radical Civic Union party, and his mother was a prominent feminist and activist for women's rights. These early influences would play a significant role in shaping Fernández's worldview and literary interests. His first work, a novel titled "Museum of Eterna's Novel," was a sprawling, unfinished manuscript that he worked on for most of his adult life. It would eventually be published posthumously and is now considered one of the most important works of avant-garde literature in the Spanish language. Despite his relatively small body of published work, Fernández's legacy looms large over the Latin American literary tradition. His close friendship with Borges, in particular, cemented his place as an important literary figure in Argentina and beyond.</p><p>In addition to his literary pursuits, Macedonio Fernández was also known for his eccentric and idiosyncratic behavior. He was known to often walk around Buenos Aires with a mattress on his back, claiming that he was "carrying his dreams with him." He was also notoriously reclusive, often refusing to leave his apartment for months at a time. Despite these quirks, he was a deeply respected figure in the literary community and his writings and teachings continued to have a profound impact on subsequent generations of writers. Today, he is remembered as one of the great literary pioneers of the 20th century and his works are still widely studied and celebrated throughout Latin America and beyond.</p><p>Fernández's writing style was marked by its avant-garde approach, and he was known for his unique use of language and structure. His fiction often blurred the lines between reality and fiction, and he frequently incorporated elements of humor and absurdity into his work. Like many writers of his time, he was heavily influenced by European literary movements such as Surrealism and Dadaism. Despite his experimental approach to writing, Fernández was also deeply interested in philosophy and theology, and his works often explored questions of existence, selfhood, and the nature of reality. He was particularly fascinated by the concept of time and its relationship to memory, and this theme recurs throughout much of his writing. Throughout his life, Fernández remained a prolific writer and thinker, even though much of his work remained unpublished until after his death. His legacy continues to inspire writers and readers around the world.</p><p>Fernández's influence on the Latin American literary scene was not only limited to his work as a writer, but also as a teacher and mentor. He taught at several universities throughout his career, and many of his students went on to achieve literary success in their own right. Among his most notable pupils were Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares, both of whom became lifelong friends and collaborators. Fernández's teachings were known for their emphasis on experimentation and creative freedom, and he encouraged his students to think outside the traditional bounds of literature. His influence on Borges, in particular, was especially significant, and the two writers often engaged in lengthy philosophical discussions about literature, existence, and the nature of reality.</p><p>Despite his contributions to the literary world, Fernández remained relatively unknown outside of literary circles until after his death. It wasn't until the 1960s and 70s that his work began to receive the critical attention it deserved, and he is now widely acknowledged as one of the most important writers of the 20th century. His writing has been praised for its innovative structure, its rich explorations of identity and memory, and its unique blend of humor and philosophy. His legacy continues to inspire contemporary writers and thinkers, and his influence on the development of Latin American literature remains as significant today as it was during his lifetime.</p><p></p><p>
