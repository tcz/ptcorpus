(April 24, 1906		Brooklyn-January 3, 1946			HM Prison Wandsworth)

	
		a.k.a. Lord Haw Haw or Joyce, William

	
was
an American
politician.


					</p><p>William Joyce was actually a British politician who was born in Brooklyn, New York. He was a prominent figure in the British Union of Fascists, ultimately becoming one of their most senior leaders. During World War II, he delivered propaganda speeches over the radio for Nazi Germany, earning him the infamous nickname of "Lord Haw Haw." He was arrested by British authorities after the war and charged with high treason. Joyce was found guilty and later hanged for his crimes at HM Prison Wandsworth in 1946.</p><p>Joyce was the son of a naturalized American citizen and a British mother. He spent most of his early life studying in the UK, where he eventually became a member of the British Union of Fascists. Joyce was a gifted speaker and his voice soon became familiar to the British public through his broadcasts on Nazi radio. He is often remembered for his broadcasts, which attempted to undermine British morale by calling them "the defeated" and promising that Germany would win the war. Despite his American birth, the British government considered him to be a traitor, as Joyce had voluntarily taken on German citizenship and broadcasted propaganda that was harmful to Britain. Joyce was tried, found guilty and hanged in one of the last executions to take place at the prison.</p><p></p><p>
