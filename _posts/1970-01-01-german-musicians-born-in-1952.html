was
a German
, .


						</p><p>woman who underwent Catholic exorcism rites during the year before her death. She was diagnosed with epileptic psychosis, and the priest Ernst Alt, who reported that he had witnessed paranormal activity during the exorcism, was later tried and convicted of negligent homicide. The case attracted media and public attention and inspired the 2005 film The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Michel is survived by her parents and three sisters, and her grave became a pilgrimage site for believers in demonic possession and exorcism.</p><p>Anneliese Michel was born into a devoutly Catholic family and attended a school run by nuns. She suffered a seizure at the age of 16 and was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. In the years that followed, despite medical treatment, Michel's condition worsened and she began experiencing hallucinations and hearing voices. She became convinced that she was possessed by demons and sought help from the Catholic Church.</p><p>After unsuccessful attempts to cure Michel with medical treatment and psychiatric care, the Church granted permission for exorcism rites to be performed. The exorcisms were carried out over a period of several months in 1975-76, and during this time Michel's health deteriorated rapidly. She stopped eating, became emaciated and weak, and finally died of starvation and dehydration.</p><p>The subsequent trial of the Catholic priest who conducted the exorcisms, along with Michel's parents, attracted widespread attention and raised questions about the role of the Church in cases of mental illness. Michel's story has since been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries. Despite the controversy surrounding the case, her family and many believers continue to see her as a martyr and a symbol of faith.</p><p></p><p>
