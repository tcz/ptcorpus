He was arrested and exiled to Siberia in 1862 for his involvement in revolutionary activities, but was released in 1865 due to ill health.</p><p>Nalbandian's legacy lives on in his literary works and his contributions to the Armenian national identity. He is widely celebrated as a hero of Armenian history and culture.</p><p>During his time studying in St. Petersburg, Mikael Nalbandian was involved in the Free Society of Russian Armenians, a group that sought to promote Armenian culture and independence.

His contributions to the Armenian national identity were also significant, as he helped to create a sense of pride and unity among Armenians during a time when they were struggling for independence and recognition. </p><p>In addition to his literary and political activities, Nalbandian was also an accomplished linguist. He spoke several languages fluently, including Armenian, Russian, French, and Italian. This linguistic versatility allowed him to translate a wide range of literary works into Armenian, and also helped him to communicate with foreign scholars and diplomats who were interested in Armenian culture and politics.</p><p>Despite his relatively short life, Mikael Nalbandian left a lasting legacy that continues to inspire and influence Armenians today.
