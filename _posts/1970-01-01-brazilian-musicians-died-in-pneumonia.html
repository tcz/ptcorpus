						Paulo Vanzolini was not only a talented musician, but also a respected scientist. He earned a degree in Zoology from the University of São Paulo and worked as a professor and researcher for many years. He was particularly known for his research on snakes, and even discovered a species of snake that was later named after him. Despite his passion for science, music remained a constant in his life, and he continued to write and perform samba until his death in 2013. Some of his most famous compositions include "Ronda" and "Volta Por Cima," which have been covered by many other Brazilian artists. In recognition of his contributions to music and science, he was awarded the Order of Cultural Merit by the Brazilian government in 2005.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=3202067" title="Wikipedia article about Paulo Vanzolini">Paulo Vanzolini on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/japanese-musicians-born-in-1971.html' title='Japanese musicians born in 1971'><strong>Japanese musicians born in 1971</strong> List of the top 50 Japanese  music stars who died in who were born in 1971</a></li><li><a href='/greek-musicians-died-in-brain-tumor.html' title='Greek musicians died in Brain tumor'><strong>Greek musicians died in Brain tumor</strong> List of the top 2 Greek music stars who died in Brain tumor</a></li><li><a href='/french-musicians-died-in-cystic-fibrosis.html' title='French musicians died in Cystic fibrosis'><strong>French musicians died in Cystic fibrosis</strong> List of the top 1 French music stars who died in Cystic fibrosis</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/british-musicians-died-in-pulmonary-embolism.html' title='British musicians died in Pulmonary embolism'><strong>British musicians died in Pulmonary embolism</strong> List of the top 1 British music stars who died in Pulmonary embolism</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actors-died-in-respiratory-failure.html' title='Indian actors died in Respiratory failure'><strong>Indian actors died in Respiratory failure</strong> List of the top 3 Indian actors who died in Respiratory failure</a></li><li><a href='/chinese-musicians-born-in-1981.html' title='Chinese musicians born in 1981'><strong>Chinese musicians born in 1981</strong> List of the top 13 Chinese  music stars who died in who were born in 1981</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
