Wayans attended Murry Bergtraum High School in Manhattan, where he excelled in sports and theatre. He later attended Tuskegee University on an athletic scholarship but dropped out after one year to pursue his passion for stand-up comedy.</p><p>Wayans began his career as a stand-up comedian in the early 1980s and quickly gained popularity for his sharp wit and controversial humor. He made his television debut in 1985 on the sketch comedy series "Saturday Night Live", but was fired after only a few episodes due to creative differences with the show's producers.</p><p>Despite this setback, Wayans went on to create some of the most memorable characters on "In Living Color," including Blaine Edwards, Anton Jackson, and the "Men on Film" duo. He also wrote and starred in the hit comedy film "Major Payne" in 1995.</p><p>Wayans’s career has not been without controversy.

The couple divorced in 2000. He then married his girlfriend, Charity Duplechan, in 2016 after over a decade of being together. In addition to his charity work and activism, Wayans is also an avid golfer and has participated in a number of celebrity golf tournaments.</p><p>Despite his numerous accomplishments, Wayans remains modest about his success, often attributing it to the support of his family and his unwavering work ethic. He continues to work in the entertainment industry, with several upcoming projects in the works, and is widely regarded as one of the most influential and talented comedians of his generation.</p><p></p><p>
