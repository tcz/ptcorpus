(October 7, 1878		Paris-February 1, 1945			Bergen-Belsen concentration camp)

	
		also known as Alfred-Georges Gressent

	
was
a French
journalist, politician and writer.


					</p><p>Valois was a founding member of the French fascist movement, the Faisceau, which was later absorbed by the much larger and more well-known far-right movement, the Front National. He was known for his controversial political views and his support of corporatism, which emphasized the importance of labor in industrial production. Valois was also a prolific writer, penning a number of books and articles on politics and economics throughout his career. Despite his embrace of fascism, Valois was not immune to the brutalities of the Nazi regime and he was eventually arrested and sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where he died in 1945.</p><p>Prior to his involvement in the French fascist movement, Georges Valois had a successful career as a journalist, serving as the editor of a number of conservative newspapers in France. He was also a founding member of the influential literary movement, Action Française, which advocated for the restoration of the monarchy in France. Valois' political views shifted towards fascism in the 1920s, leading him to found the Faisceau in 1925. Despite not being a member of the Faisceau's paramilitary wing, Valois was implicated in a number of violent incidents associated with the group's activities. In 1936, he attempted to distance himself from the movement by founding a new political party, the Republican Social Party, which emphasized his support for corporatism and his opposition to both communism and liberalism. However, this party failed to achieve any significant political success and Valois' political career effectively ended with the outbreak of World War II.</p><p>Valois' political views were complex and often controversial. Although he initially supported a restoration of the French monarchy, he later became disillusioned with this idea and instead embraced fascist ideology. His belief in corporatism was particularly influential, and he argued that the traditional class struggle between labor and capital could be overcome by greater collaboration between workers and employers. Despite this, Valois' ideas were often criticized for their authoritarianism and their perceived opposition to individual freedoms.</p><p>In addition to his political activities, Valois was a prolific writer and commentator. He wrote for a number of newspapers and journals throughout his career, including the influential journal L'Action Française. He also authored a number of books, including the influential work "Fascisme Français", which laid out his vision for a French fascist state.</p><p>Valois' political views and activities were controversial throughout his lifetime and continue to be the subject of debate and discussion today. Despite his rejection of traditional political labels, he is widely considered to be one of the early pioneers of French fascism and a significant figure in the history of right-wing politics in France.</p><p>After his death, some of Valois' works were republished and gained a cult following among far-right groups in France and beyond. Despite this, Valois' legacy remains contentious and is often debated within academic and political circles. Some scholars argue that Valois' ideas were ahead of their time, and that he was simply misunderstood by his contemporaries. Others, however, argue that his beliefs in authoritarianism and a specific brand of corporatism were inherently flawed and dangerous. Regardless of one's opinion of Georges Valois, his life and work continue to be an important part of the complex and multi-faceted history of right-wing politics and fascism in France.</p><p></p><p>

was
a French
philosopher.


					</p><p>Montesquieu was best known for his book "The Spirit of Laws" which was published in 1748. In this work, he discussed the concept of separation of powers, which was later adopted in the United States Constitution. Montesquieu's ideas on political and social systems heavily influenced the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. He was a member of the French Academy of Sciences and the Bordeaux Parlement, and he also wrote several novels and essays on various subjects such as Persian letters, the growth of societies and more. Montesquieu is considered one of the most important political philosophers of the Enlightenment era.</p><p>Throughout his life, Montesquieu traveled extensively and gained a deep understanding of different cultures and social systems. He spent several years in England, where he was inspired by the British political system and the way it balanced power. His work "The Spirit of Laws" not only discussed the separation of powers, but also examined different types of governments and their advantages and disadvantages. Montesquieu believed that the ideal government was one in which power was distributed among different branches, creating checks and balances. </p><p>Montesquieu was not only a philosopher but also a social commentator. His work "Persian Letters" satirized the French political and social systems through the eyes of two Persian travellers. He also wrote about slavery, criticizing the enslavement of Africans and calling for abolition. </p><p>Montesquieu's influence can be seen in the American Constitution and the founding of the United States. His ideas were also influential in the French Revolution, although he did not live to see it. Montesquieu's legacy continues to inspire philosophers and thinkers today.</p><p>Montesquieu was born into a wealthy family of nobility and was educated in law at the University of Bordeaux. He inherited the title of Baron de La Brède and Montesquieu from his uncle in 1716.

This work was widely popular and helped establish his reputation as a writer and philosopher. In addition to his philosophical and literary pursuits, Montesquieu was also involved in politics, serving as a judge in the Bordeaux Parlement. Despite several attempts, he was never able to gain a significant political position. Montesquieu's ideas on the separation of powers and the role of government in society continue to influence political theory and practice to this day.</p><p>Montesquieu's influence on political philosophy extended beyond Europe and impacted the world. During the 19th century, his ideas were influential in the development of constitutional government in Latin America. In the United States, his theories were employed by the founding fathers in drafting the Constitution, specifically in the implementation of the checks and balances system among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government. Furthermore, Montesquieu's advocacy for individual liberties and his criticism of despotic regimes resonated with thinkers like Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, who postulated that government should protect individual rights and liberties. Montesquieu's legacy continued to inspire thinkers in the 20th century, including Hannah Arendt, who incorporated his theories in her critiques of totalitarianism. Overall, Montesquieu's groundbreaking theories on the separation of powers and the importance of balance in governance have been crucial in shaping modern democratic institutions globally.</p><p></p><p>

(July 14, 1816		Ville-d&#039;Avray-October 13, 1882			Turin)

	
		also known as Arthur comte de Gobineau or Joseph-Arthur, Count de Gobineau

	
was
a French
novelist and diplomat.


					</p><p>However, he is primarily known today for his works in the field of anthropology, particularly his theory of the "Aryan master race" and the view that the mixing of races leads to the decline of civilizations. His most famous work, "An Essay on the Inequality of Human Races," had a significant impact on racial thinking in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and was widely cited by white supremacists, fascists, and Nazi ideologues. Despite his controversial views, Gobineau was a respected figure in his own time, and served as a diplomat in several European capitals, including Tehran, Rio de Janeiro, and Stockholm. He remains a subject of interest and debate among scholars of race and racism to this day.</p><p>Gobineau was born into a wealthy aristocratic family and was well-versed in the culture and traditions of Europe's noble class. His experiences traveling throughout the world as a diplomat inspired his interest in anthropology and led him to develop his theories on race and civilization. Aside from his controversial racial ideas, Gobineau was also a prolific writer and published several novels, most notably "Les Pléiades" and "Madame Irmine," which were well-received in their time. He was a member of the prestigious French Academy, and his writings on art and literature were highly regarded by his contemporaries. Gobineau's legacy is complex, and while his ideas have been widely discredited, his impact on the development of racial thought and its wider historical context continue to be discussed and debated today.</p><p>In addition to his influential theories on race and civilization, Arthur de Gobineau was also known for his political views. He was a staunch conservative and monarchist, advocating for the preservation of the aristocratic system in Europe. He believed that the middle and working classes were incapable of governing themselves and that only the nobility was fit to rule. Gobineau's political beliefs were reflected in his diplomatic career, where he often clashed with his superiors and sought to advance his own interests over those of his country. Despite his controversial and often divisive views, Gobineau was seen as a talented and dedicated diplomat, and his writings on art, literature, and politics continue to be studied and debated by scholars today.</p><p>Gobineau's controversial racial theories were a product of his time, and reflected a widespread belief in European society that certain races were inherently superior to others. His arguments were based on a flawed understanding of biology, and ignored significant cultural and historical factors in the development of civilizations. However, his influence on the development of racial thought cannot be denied, and his work has been studied and debated by scholars from a wide range of disciplines.Gobineau's political views were also a significant part of his legacy. He believed that the decline of European civilization was caused by the erosion of the traditional aristocratic system, and that the rise of democracy and capitalism would lead to the collapse of the continent's political and social order. His vision of a Europe ruled by the aristocracy and guided by traditional values remains a controversial subject of debate today, and his influence on the development of conservative and nationalist movements in Europe and beyond is still felt to this day.</p><p></p><p>

He was a vocal opponent of the death penalty and worked to reform the criminal justice system in France. He also supported the rights of Jews and other minorities, and his views on tolerance and equality were ahead of his time.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Mérimée was known for his humility and his tendency to avoid the spotlight. He was admired by his peers for his wit and intellect, and he had a close circle of friends that included some of the most important writers and artists of his time. He died in 1870 at the age of 66, leaving behind a legacy as one of France's greatest literary and cultural figures.</p><p></p><p>

(October 26, 1742		Trie-Château-September 29, 1809)

	
		also known as Charles Francois Dupuis

	
was
a French
scientist.


					</p><p>He was particularly interested in astronomy and mathematics, studying under Joseph-Louis Lagrange in Turin before returning to France to become a professor of ancient history. Dupuis was known for his controversial theories about the origins of religion, in which he used his knowledge of astronomy to argue that many religious myths and symbols were based on astrological events. His best-known work is "Origine de tous les cultes, ou, Religion universelle", which was published in 1794 and caused significant controversy at the time. Despite his unorthodox ideas, Dupuis was respected as a scholar and became a member of the prestigious Institut de France.</p><p>Dupuis was born into a family of modest means and started his career as a teacher of mathematics at a military school. He became interested in astronomy after attending a lecture by the renowned astronomer Jacques Cassini. He went on to write several papers on astronomy, including one on the transit of Venus, which earned him a prize from the Académie des Sciences.</p><p>Despite his success in astronomy, Dupuis felt a pull towards ancient history, and he eventually abandoned his scientific work to become a professor of ancient history at the Collège de France. It was during this time that he developed his controversial theories on religion, which he believed to be nothing more than a collection of myths and symbols based on astronomical phenomena.</p><p>His work "Origine de tous les cultes, ou, Religion universelle" drew attention from both critics and supporters, with some praising its visionary insight and others condemning it as blasphemy. Despite the controversy, Dupuis continued to develop his ideas on the origins of religion, earning him a place as a member of the prestigious Institut de France.</p><p>In his later years, Dupuis continued to write and publish works on ancient history and astronomy. He died in 1809, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering thinker whose ideas challenged traditional beliefs about religion and its role in society.</p><p>Throughout his career, Dupuis made significant contributions to the fields of astronomy and ancient history. He was a member of the Académie des Sciences and received numerous honors and awards for his work.</p><p>In addition to his controversial theories on religion, Dupuis also made important scientific discoveries. He was one of the first scientists to propose the idea of a planet beyond Uranus, which led to the discovery of Neptune. He also developed a method for calculating the distances between stars, which helped to advance the field of astrometry.</p><p>Dupuis was known for his rigorous research methods and his dedication to exploring new ideas. Despite facing significant opposition to his theories, he remained committed to his work and continued to publish groundbreaking research throughout his career.</p><p>Today, Dupuis is remembered as a pioneering figure in the fields of astronomy and ancient history. His theories on the origins of religion continue to be debated, and his scientific discoveries continue to influence the way that we understand the universe.</p><p>In addition to his work in astronomy and ancient history, Charles-François Dupuis was also known for his active involvement in the French Revolution. He was a member of the radical Jacobin Club and supported the secularization of French society. He even proposed a new calendar, known as the Republican Calendar, which would replace the traditional Gregorian calendar with a more rational and scientific system. While the Republican Calendar was eventually adopted by the French government, it was abolished in 1806 after the fall of Napoleon. Nonetheless, Dupuis' contributions to the revolutionary movement earned him a place in history as a political thinker and activist.</p><p></p><p>
