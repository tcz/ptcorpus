							Sirpa Lane began her acting career in the late 1960s, appearing in a number of European films with erotic and controversial themes. Her most famous role came in 1974, when she starred in the French-Italian co-production "The Beast." The film, directed by Walerian Borowczyk, caused a scandal due to its explicit content and sexual themes, but is now considered a cult classic. </p><p>Lane continued to work in film throughout the 1970s and 80s, primarily in Europe, appearing in films such as "Diary of a Nymphomaniac" and "The Fruit is Ripe." However, after a few unsuccessful attempts to break into Hollywood, she retired from acting in the early 1990s. </p><p>Sadly, Lane's life was cut short by illness. She contracted HIV in the late 1980s, and after struggling with the disease for several years, passed away on her 53rd birthday in 1999 on the Spanish island of Formentera.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=35562967" title="Wikipedia article about Sirpa Lane">Sirpa Lane on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/indian-musicians-died-at-age-23.html' title='Indian musicians died at age 23'><strong>Indian musicians died at age 23</strong> List of the top 4 Indian music stars who died when they were 23</a></li><li><a href='/italian-actresses-died-in-colorectal-cancer.html' title='Italian actresses died in Colorectal cancer'><strong>Italian actresses died in Colorectal cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Italian actresses who died in Colorectal cancer</a></li><li><a href='/american-musicians-died-at-age-79.html' title='American musicians died at age 79'><strong>American musicians died at age 79</strong> List of the top 21 American music stars who died when they were 79</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/jamaican-musicians-died-at-age-39.html' title='Jamaican musicians died at age 39'><strong>Jamaican musicians died at age 39</strong> List of the top 3 Jamaican music stars who died when they were 39</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-actresses-died-at-age-50.html' title='Austrian actresses died at age 50'><strong>Austrian actresses died at age 50</strong> List of the top 1 Austrian actresses who died when they were 50</a></li><li><a href='/hongkongese-musicians-died-at-age-35.html' title='Hongkongese musicians died at age 35'><strong>Hongkongese musicians died at age 35</strong> List of the top 1 Hongkongese music stars who died when they were 35</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
