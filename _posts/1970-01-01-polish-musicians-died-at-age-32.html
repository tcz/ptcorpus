(July 12, 1929-July 2, 1962)


was
a Polish
writer.


					</p><p>Jan Długosz was a Polish writer and historian, known for his monumental historical work, "Annales seu cronici incliti Regni Poloniae" (Annals or Chronicles of the illustrious Kingdom of Poland). Born in Brzeźnica, Poland in 1415, Długosz studied at the Kraków Academy, where he later became a professor. He served as a diplomat for the Polish king and was also a prominent member of the Catholic Church, eventually becoming the Bishop of Lwów. Długosz's chronicle, which spans from the legendary founding of Poland to the reign of King Casimir IV Jagiellon, is considered one of the most important works of Polish literature and historical writing. It provides a detailed account of the political, social, and cultural developments of medieval Poland and is a valuable primary source for modern historians. Despite Długosz's early death in 1480, his work continued to be influential, inspiring numerous later chroniclers and shaping the Polish national identity.</p><p>Additionally, Jan Długosz was known for his patronage of the arts and his extensive collection of books, which included works in Latin, Polish, and other languages. He was a major advocate for Latin as the language of intellectual discourse, but he also recognized the importance of vernacular languages in literature and culture. Długosz's work was not without controversy, however, as some criticized his tendency to glorify the Polish monarchy and downplay the contributions of other political and religious groups. Despite these criticisms, Długosz remains an important figure in Polish history and literature, and his work continues to be studied and celebrated to this day.</p><p></p><p>

She continued to resist and organize in the camp, even participating in a brief uprising in October 1944.
