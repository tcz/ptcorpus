(June 25, 1884-June 25, 1917)

	
		also known as Geza Gyoni

	
was
a Hungarian
writer.


					</p><p>He was born in Budapest, Hungary, and studied law and humanities at the University of Budapest. He published his first collection of poems, "A világ öröme" (The Joy of the World), in 1908, which was well received by the public and critics. Over the next few years, Gyóni established himself as an important figure in the Hungarian literary scene, and he contributed to various literary magazines and newspapers.</p><p>In addition to his poetry, Gyóni also wrote plays and prose works, including "Az én időm" (My Time), a collection of autobiographical essays. He was known for his vivid and evocative writing style, which often explored themes of love, death, and the natural world. His works were influenced by the Symbolist movement and the French fin de siècle literature.</p><p>Tragically, Gyóni died at the young age of 33, from complications caused by tuberculosis. Despite his short life, he left a significant mark on Hungarian literature, and his works continue to be read and studied today.</p><p>One of Gyóni's most famous works is the novel "A néma levente" (The Silent Levente), which was published posthumously in 1918. It tells the story of a young man named Levente who loses his ability to speak and becomes isolated from society. The novel is considered a masterpiece of Hungarian modernist literature and has been translated into multiple languages.</p><p>Gyóni was also involved in politics and was a part of the radical socialist movement in Hungary. He was a vocal critic of the government and the social injustices of his time. This activism is reflected in his literary works, which often have a political undercurrent.</p><p>In honor of Gyóni's contributions to Hungarian literature, several literary awards have been established in his name. The Géza Gyóni Prize is awarded every other year to Hungarian writers who have made significant contributions to modernist literature. The Géza Gyóni Scholarship is also awarded to young writers who show promise in continuing Gyóni's legacy.</p><p>Gyóni was also passionate about translating works from other languages into Hungarian. He translated works by French poets such as Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud into Hungarian, and his translations were highly regarded by his peers. He believed that translating literature was a way to enrich Hungarian culture and bring new ideas to the country.Gyóni's personal life was also marked by tragedy. He lost his mother at a young age, and he struggled to maintain relationships with women throughout his life. In 1913, he married Ilona Harmos, but their marriage was short-lived due to Gyóni's declining health. Despite these personal struggles, he remained committed to his writing and continued to produce work until his death.Gyóni's legacy continues to influence Hungarian literature and culture today. His powerful writing style and political activism have inspired many Hungarian writers, and his translation work has contributed to the growth of Hungarian literature as a whole. He remains an important figure in Hungarian literary history and his works continue to be celebrated by readers and scholars alike.</p><p></p><p>
