He dedicated his career to uncovering the ancient history of Ireland and his contributions to the field of archaeology continue to be recognized and celebrated today.</p><p>Raftery's work was instrumental in changing perceptions of the Irish Iron Age and Early Medieval period from being considered a "Dark Age" to one of a sophisticated and vibrant society.

Raftery's expertise in Celtic archaeology was highly sought after, leading him to act as a consultant on various historical films and documentaries. He also contributed to the development of archaeological exhibitions and museums in Ireland, including the National Museum of Ireland where his research is still referenced by scholars today. Raftery's impact on the field of Irish archaeology was recognized posthumously with the establishment of the Barry Raftery Memorial Lecture Series, an annual event that invites renowned archaeologists to speak on topics related to Celtic archaeology. Raftery's passion for uncovering Ireland's rich past remains an inspiration to scholars and enthusiasts alike.</p><p></p><p>
