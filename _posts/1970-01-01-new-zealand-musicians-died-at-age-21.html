(June 27, 1918		Hastings-June 7, 1940			Échemines)


was
a New Zealand
personality.


					</p><p>He was a fighter pilot and a leading ace of the Royal Air Force during World War II. Kain served in the Battle of France, where he achieved his first kills, and later flew in the Battle of Britain. He was credited with a total of 16 enemy aircraft destroyed, making him one of New Zealand's most successful fighter pilots of the war. Kain tragically died in a flying accident in France, just a few months before the Battle of Britain commenced. Despite his short career, he was widely respected and regarded for his skill and bravery in the air.</p><p>Kain was born in Hastings, New Zealand, and attended Christ's College in Christchurch before joining the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 1936. He was selected for pilot training and later transferred to the Royal Air Force in 1937. He was posted to No. 73 Squadron in France in 1939 and achieved his first victory in May 1940, shooting down a Messerschmitt Bf 109.</p><p>Kain quickly became known for his aggressive and fearless flying style, often leading attacks on enemy targets. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service in the Battle of France. After the fall of France, Kain continued to fly with No. 73 Squadron in the Battle of Britain, where he added to his tally of victories.</p><p>On June 7, 1940, Kain was flying his Hurricane fighter over France when his engine failed. He attempted to make an emergency landing, but his aircraft crashed and he was killed. Kain was buried in Échemines, France, and was posthumously awarded a second Distinguished Flying Cross.</p><p>Kain's legacy as one of New Zealand's greatest fighter pilots of World War II has been commemorated through various memorials, including a statue in his hometown of Hastings and a road named after him at the Royal Air Force Museum in London.</p><p>Kain's contributions to the war effort were also recognised by the Royal Air Force, which named a flight simulator after him at their training center in Cranwell. Additionally, a book about Kain's life, titled "Kiwi Air Ace: The Story of Wing Commander Edgar James Kain, DFC," was published in 2008 by Ian Mackersey. </p><p>Kain's family also played a significant role in New Zealand's aviation history. His brother, William "Bill" Kain, was a navigator for Air New Zealand and was tragically killed in the crash of TE901, also known as the Mount Erebus disaster, in 1979. Kain's nephew, Glen Watt, became a commercial pilot and served as president of the New Zealand Airline Pilots' Association. </p><p>Kain's legacy continues to inspire young New Zealanders to pursue careers in aviation and the military. In 2018, on the 100th anniversary of Kain's birth, a commemorative flyover was conducted over Hastings in his honor, with vintage warplanes taking to the skies to pay tribute to one of New Zealand's most celebrated war heroes.</p><p></p><p>
