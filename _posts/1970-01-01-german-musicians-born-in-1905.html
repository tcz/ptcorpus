was
a German
professional boxer, actor and businessperson.


						</p><p>Schmeling was one of the most famous boxers of the 20th century, having won both the heavyweight championship of the world and an Olympic gold medal in boxing for Germany. He is largely remembered for his two fights against Joe Louis, where he won the first match in a major upset but was defeated in a highly publicized rematch. </p><p>Outside of the ring, Schmeling was a controversial figure owing to his association with the Nazi party in Germany. However, he was later known for his efforts to protect and support two Jewish children during the Holocaust, and for his friendship with Joe Louis despite their differences in nationality and race. </p><p>After retiring from boxing, Schmeling worked as a businessperson and became a successful Coca-Cola executive in Germany. He was also involved in acting, and appeared in several films both in Germany and in the United States. Schmeling passed away at the age of 99 at his home in Wenzendorf, Germany.</p><p>Schmeling began his boxing career in 1924 and quickly rose to fame, winning the European heavyweight title in 1928.

He held the title until 1932 when he lost to Sharkey in a controversial rematch.</p><p>Schmeling's association with the Nazi party began in 1933 when he was introduced to Adolf Hitler. Despite claims that he was a member of the party, Schmeling always maintained that he was not a political person and only attended events when he was invited. However, his image suffered when he was featured in Nazi propaganda films and he was widely criticized for fighting for Germany during World War II.</p><p>Despite his controversial past, Schmeling was admired for his bravery during his two fights against Joe Louis. In their first match in 1936, Schmeling defeated Louis in a 12-round knockout, which made him a national hero in Germany. However, in their highly anticipated rematch in 1938, Louis defeated Schmeling in just two minutes, solidifying his position as one of the greatest boxers of all time.</p><p>Schmeling's bravery extended beyond the ring, however. In 1938, he helped Jewish children escape persecution in Germany and supported their education and well-being throughout World War II. After the war, Schmeling and Louis became close friends and remained so until Louis' death in 1981.</p><p>Schmeling's legacy as one of boxing's greatest champions remains intact to this day. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992 and was recognized for his contributions to boxing and society as a whole.</p><p>Schmeling was born in the small village of Klein Luckow in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. He grew up in a poor family and began boxing as a teenager to make some money. He quickly developed a talent for the sport and embarked on a professional career in 1924.</p><p>Schmeling's success in the ring brought him fame and fortune, but he was also known for his charm and good looks. He became a popular figure in Germany and was admired by both men and women.</p><p>In addition to his achievements in boxing, Schmeling was also an accomplished pilot. He learned to fly in the 1920s and later joined the Luftwaffe, the German air force, during World War II. He flew numerous missions over Europe and was eventually shot down over Tunisia in 1943. He survived the crash and spent several years as a prisoner of war before being released in 1945.</p><p>After the war, Schmeling returned to Germany and resumed his career as a businessman. He became involved with Coca-Cola and helped to establish the company's operations in Germany. He also appeared in several films, including "The Young Rajah" (1922) and "Max Schmeling vs. Joe Louis" (1938).</p><p>Schmeling's reputation was tarnished by his association with the Nazi party, but he was later recognized for his humanitarian efforts during the Holocaust. He supported Jewish children and helped them escape persecution, putting his own safety at risk in the process.</p><p>Schmeling remained active in the boxing world even after retiring from the ring. He trained and managed several fighters, including Rudi Lubbers and Gerrie Coetzee. He also worked as a commentator for German television, providing insights and analysis on boxing matches.</p><p>Schmeling was married to Anny Ondra, a Czech actress, from 1933 until her death in 1987. He then married a German actress, Ursula Gadow, in 1995. The couple remained together until Schmeling's death in 2005 at the age of 99.</p><p>Schmeling's contributions to boxing and humanity were recognized throughout his life and after his passing. He was awarded the German Order of Merit in 1970 and was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003. In 2004, he was named an honorary citizen of Wenzendorf, the town where he lived for many years. Schmeling was known for his humility and generosity, and he donated much of his wealth to charitable causes.</p><p>Despite his controversial past, Schmeling's legacy remains as one of the greatest boxers in history, and as a kind and compassionate human being. His story is a testament to the fact that even those who fall into difficult circumstances can rise above and make a positive impact on the world.</p><p></p><p>
