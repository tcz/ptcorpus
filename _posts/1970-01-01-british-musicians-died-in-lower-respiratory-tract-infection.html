						</p><p>John Mills was one of Britain's most beloved actors, having appeared in over 120 films during his long career. He began acting in 1929 and became a star in the 1940s with roles in films such as "This Happy Breed" and "Great Expectations". Mills won an Academy Award for his role in the film "Ryan's Daughter" in 1970 and was knighted in 1976. He appeared in a range of films throughout his career, from war dramas to comedies, and was known for his ability to bring depth and humanity to his roles. In addition to his successful acting career, Mills was also a dedicated supporter of charities, including Save the Children and the NSPCC. After his death at the age of 97, he was remembered as a true legend of British cinema.</p><p>Mills originally wanted to join the Royal Navy but was denied entry due to a problem with his hearing. This led him to pursue acting instead, and he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He made his stage debut in 1929 and his film debut in 1932. Mills served in the British Army during World War II, and his experiences influenced his later roles as soldiers in films such as "Ice Cold in Alex" and "The Colditz Story".</p><p>In addition to his work on screen, Mills was also an accomplished stage actor, appearing in numerous productions in the West End and on Broadway. His notable stage work includes "Ross" and "The Good Companions". Mills also wrote his own memoir, "Up in the Clouds, Gentlemen Please", which was published in 1980.</p><p>Mills was married to playwright Mary Hayley Bell from 1941 until her death in 2005. Their daughter, Hayley Mills, became a successful actress in her own right. Mills was known for his down-to-earth charm and his dedication to his family and career. He remained active in the film industry well into his nineties, and his final film appearance was in "Bright Young Things" in 2003.</p><p>Despite his successful career, Mills faced some personal struggles. In the 1960s, he battled depression and alcoholism, which he attributed to the pressure of being a public figure. He sought treatment and was able to overcome these challenges, later becoming an advocate for mental health awareness. Mills also faced criticism for his decision to continue acting in controversial films such as "Oh! What a Lovely War" and "The Big Sleep" in the 1960s and 1970s, which some saw as not befitting his status as a respected actor. Nevertheless, Mills remained a beloved figure in British cinema, and his contribution to the industry was recognized with numerous awards and honors throughout his life.</p><p></p><p>
