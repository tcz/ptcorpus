						</p><p>Actually, Edson Chagas is not an actor or cinematographer but a contemporary visual artist from Angola. He was born on May 7, 1977 in Luanda, Angola. Chagas gained international recognition after his participation in the 55th Venice Biennale in 2013, where he won the Golden Lion for best national participation with his work entitled "Luanda, Encyclopedic City". He is known for his conceptual photography, installations, and videos that explore themes of identity, colonization, globalization, and urbanism. His works have been exhibited in several prominent art institutions and events worldwide, such as the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art and Documenta 14.</p><p>Chagas started his artistic career as a photojournalist in Angola before moving to Brazil in 2000. He studied at the Antonio Carlos Jobim School of Music, where he took courses in audiovisual production and visual arts. He later moved to London, where he earned a Master of Arts in Photography from the University of Arts London in 2007.</p><p>Chagas has been highly influential in the contemporary African art scene, and his work continues to inspire new generations of artists. His works often challenge contemporary attitudes and notions about the history and current situation of Africa, offering new perspectives and interpretation of the continent and its people.</p><p>Aside from his artistic practice, Chagas has also been involved in cultural diplomacy and advocacy, working closely with cultural organizations and institutions to help promote African art and artists on the global stage. In 2019, he was appointed as the curator for the Angolan pavilion at the Venice Biennale, where he showcased the works of several young Angolan artists.</p><p>Chagas' works have been praised for their innovative and thought-provoking approach, as well as their ability to engage with audiences from diverse backgrounds. His most celebrated work, "Luanda, Encyclopedic City", is a series of photographs that depict everyday life in the Angolan capital city of Luanda, highlighting the city's cultural and architectural diversity. The work challenges traditional notions of a city's identity and suggests that Luanda, and by extension all cities, are multifaceted and constantly evolving.</p><p>In addition to his Golden Lion win at the Venice Biennale, Chagas has won numerous other awards and accolades for his work, including the Discovery Award at Rencontres de Bamako, the Bamako Photography Encounters in Mali in 2011, and the BES Photo Award in Portugal in 2009.</p><p>Chagas continues to create new works and has recently been exploring the relationship between audience and artwork. He has been experimenting with interactive installations and performances that encourage viewer participation and engagement.</p><p>Overall, Edson Chagas has made a significant contribution to the contemporary art world, particularly in the areas of African art and conceptual photography. His work challenges viewers to question their preconceptions about identity, culture, and society, and has inspired many artists to explore similar themes in their own work.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/indian-actors-died-at-age-48.html' title='Indian actors died at age 48'><strong>Indian actors died at age 48</strong> List of the top 5 Indian actors who died when they were 48</a></li><li><a href='/chilean-actors-died-in-1972.html' title='Chilean actors died in 1972'><strong>Chilean actors died in 1972</strong> List of the top 2 Chilean actors who died in 1972</a></li><li><a href='/south-korean-actors-died-at-age-48.html' title='South Korean actors died at age 48'><strong>South Korean actors died at age 48</strong> List of the top 1 South Korean actors who died when they were 48</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-indigestion.html' title='American actors died in Indigestion'><strong>American actors died in Indigestion</strong> List of the top 1 American actors who died in Indigestion</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actors-died-in-1957.html' title='Indian actors died in 1957'><strong>Indian actors died in 1957</strong> List of the top 3 Indian actors who died in 1957</a></li><li><a href='/belgian-actors-died-in-stroke.html' title='Belgian actors died in Stroke'><strong>Belgian actors died in Stroke</strong> List of the top 1 Belgian actors who died in Stroke</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
