(January 23, 1967		Havana-September 11, 1999			Havana)


was
a Cuban
painter.


					</p><p>She is best known for her innovative art style that blended the traditions of the Afro-Cuban religion and Western modernism. Ayón trained at the Instituto Superior de Arte in Havana, where she earned her degree in printmaking. She gained national recognition for her prints and drawings in the early 1990s and began incorporating elements of the Afro-Cuban myth of the Abakuá into her work. Ayón's art often featured the Abakuá's founding figures, the Ekpe and Ireme societies, and their complex belief systems. In 1993, she co-founded the Estudio Experimental de Gráfica workshop, where she worked with other artists to create new techniques and methods for printmaking. Despite her untimely death at the age of 32, Ayón's legacy lives on through her powerful artworks, which has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world.</p><p>Ayón was the subject of several solo exhibitions in Cuba and internationally, including at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana and the Fowler Museum at UCLA. Her works have also been included in group exhibitions at prestigious institutions such as the Venice Biennale and the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. In addition to her contributions to the art world, Ayón was a member of the Union of Writers and Artists of Cuba and was posthumously awarded the National Prize for Visual Arts in 2001. Her impact on the art world has inspired numerous artists to incorporate Afro-Cuban traditions into their own artwork.</p><p>Belkis Ayón's works have been described as haunting, powerful, and enigmatic. Her unique style blended elements of printmaking, drawing, and painting, and often featured mysterious, shadowy figures inspired by the Abakuá myth. The Abakuá religion, which originated in Cuba among enslaved Africans, was highly secretive and forbidden for many years. Ayón's art helped to bring the Abakuá myth and culture into the public eye, while also confronting issues such as oppression, isolation, and identity. Her works continue to be studied by art historians, scholars of Afro-Cuban culture, and fans of contemporary art alike. In addition to her artistic achievements, Ayón was also remembered for her dedication to mentoring younger artists, and her commitment to advocating for greater recognition of Cuban art on the global stage. Today, she is considered one of the most important Cuban artists of the 20th century.</p><p>Belkis Ayón took an interest in the Abakuá religion at a young age, when she overheard her father speaking of his initiation into the male-only society. Her fascination with the religion only grew from there, and she began learning everything she could about its rituals and beliefs. Ayón's art was heavily influenced by the Abakuá's complex mythology, which she saw as a rich source of inspiration for exploring themes of power, sacrifice, and identity. Her striking black-and-white prints and drawings employed deep symbolism and intricate patterns, reflecting the complexity and depth of the Abakuá world. Ayón's legacy has continued to inspire new generations of artists, particularly within the Afro-Cuban community, who see her artwork as a way to connect with their cultural heritage and affirm their identity. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in her work, with major exhibitions and retrospectives on her career taking place in museums and galleries around the world. Through her art, Ayón has become an important voice in contemporary Cuban culture, and a testament to the enduring power of artistic vision and imagination.</p><p>Despite her short career, Belkis Ayón's impact on the art world has been significant. Her unique fusion of Afro-Cuban religion and modernism has inspired artists not only in Cuba, but around the world. Ayón's art has also helped to raise awareness of the Afro-Cuban culture and traditions, which had been largely ignored or marginalized for many years. Her legacy has been celebrated with posthumous retrospectives at institutions such as the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach, California, the Wilfredo Lam Center in Havana, and the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto. In addition, her work has been featured in several books and catalogs, including "Belkis Ayón: Nkame," which was published in conjunction with a major traveling exhibition of her work in the United States. Today, Ayón remains an influential figure in the Cuban art world, and her art continues to inspire and challenge audiences around the world.</p><p></p><p>
