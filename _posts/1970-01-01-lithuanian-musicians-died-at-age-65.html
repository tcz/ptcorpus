film director, screenwriter and film producer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work as a founding member of the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers, which was created in 1919 in order to challenge the monopoly that the major Hollywood studios had on the film industry. Abramson directed more than 100 films during his career and was known for his innovative camera techniques and use of special effects. He started his career in film in 1909 as a producer and director of short films, and later directed feature films in both the silent and sound eras. Abramson was also a pioneer in the use of synchronized sound in film, with his 1922 film "Are You Listening?" being one of the first to feature synchronized sound effects. Despite these important contributions to the film industry, Abramson's work has largely been overlooked by film historians, and his films are not widely available today.</p><p></p><p>
