		children,
		Elbert Hubbard II, Sanford Hubbard, Ralph Hubbard, Catherine Bryan and Miriam Elberta Hubbard.

						</p><p>Elbert Hubbard was an influential figure in the late 19th and early 20th century American arts and crafts movement. He founded the Roycroft artisan community in East Aurora, New York, which produced a wide range of handmade goods including books, furniture, and metalwork. Hubbard was also a prolific writer, publishing numerous essays and articles in his magazine, The Philistine, as well as several books on topics such as business, philosophy, and personal development. His most famous work is likely his essay “A Message to Garcia,” which celebrates the virtues of initiative and perseverance in the face of adversity. Hubbard was aboard the RMS Lusitania when it was sunk by a German submarine in May of 1915, and he lost his life in the disaster.</p><p>Hubbard was a highly sought-after public speaker and lecturer during his lifetime, and he often gave talks on topics such as business ethics, creativity, and spirituality. He was known for his wit and his ability to captivate audiences with his storytelling. Additionally, Hubbard was a staunch advocate for women's rights, and he spoke out against the societal norms of his time that restricted women from pursuing their own ambitions and interests. Today, Hubbard's legacy lives on through the work of the Roycroft community, which still produces handcrafted items in East Aurora, and through his influential writings that continue to inspire readers around the world.</p><p>In addition to his work as a writer and philosopher, Elbert Hubbard was also involved in politics. He ran for Congress in 1906 as an independent candidate but was defeated. Hubbard was a strong believer in individualism and self-reliance, and his writings often reflected these values. He was also a proponent of the Arts and Crafts movement, which emphasized the importance of craftsmanship and traditional skills. </p><p>Hubbard was married to Alice Moore Hubbard, who was also a writer and active member of the Roycroft community.

Rockefeller. His works remain popular today, with his message of self-determination and individualism resonating with readers around the world.</p><p>After Hubbard's death, the Roycroft community continued to thrive under the guidance of his successor, Elbert Hubbard II. However, the community eventually fell into decline in the 1920s, and much of its property was sold off. In the 1970s, efforts were made to revive the Roycroft community, and today it is once again a vibrant center for arts and crafts in the United States. Hubbard's writings have also continued to be influential in the years since his death, with many of his essays and articles still widely read and studied today. In addition to "A Message to Garcia," some of his other notable works include "The Mintage," "The Fraud of Feminism," and "Little Journeys to the Homes of Good Men and Great."

In 1985, he was banned from entering Israel altogether. Kahane returned to the United States and continued to advocate for his beliefs until his death in 1990.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Kahane's ideas continue to inspire far-right groups in both the United States and Israel.</p><p>Kahane's assassination in 1990 in New York City remains unsolved, with no one ever charged for the murder. In addition to his political and religious views, Kahane was also a prolific writer, publishing numerous books on Judaism and Zionism. His most well-known works include "They Must Go" and "Uncomfortable Questions for Comfortable Jews." Despite his extremist views, Kahane had a significant following among some Jewish communities, particularly those in the United States who felt a strong sense of insecurity and vulnerability in the face of anti-Semitism. However, his views and actions remain deeply divisive, with many viewing his brand of religious nationalism as anathema to the principles of democracy and human rights.</p><p>Kahane's legacy continues to be debated to this day, with some far-right groups in Israel and the United States continuing to promote his views and ideology. However, his extremist and racist beliefs have been widely condemned by mainstream Jewish organizations and leaders. Many argue that Kahane's divisive and violent rhetoric only serves to exacerbate tensions between Jews and Arabs in Israel, and that his vision of an exclusively Jewish state is both impractical and immoral. Despite this, Kahane's ideas have continued to resonate with a small but vocal minority of supporters, who see him as a champion of the Jewish people in a hostile world. Regardless of one's views on Kahane, there is no denying that his life and legacy remain a complex and contentious issue in both Jewish and political circles.</p><p></p><p>

(January 15, 1892		Dublin-July 21, 1950			North Hollywood)

	
		also known as Reginald Ingram Montgomery Hitchcock or Rex Hitchcock

	
was
an American
writer, film director, screenwriter, actor and film producer.


					</p><p>He was born in Dublin, Ireland and moved to the United States in 1911. Ingram began his career as an actor in silent films before transitioning to directing in the 1920s. He is best known for his work on the films "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" (1921), "The Prisoner of Zenda" (1922), and "Scaramouche" (1923). Ingram was considered a master of the epic film genre and his films often featured extravagant sets and costumes. He was also known for his commitment to casting actors of color in prominent roles, making him a pioneer in promoting racial diversity in Hollywood. Despite his success during the silent era, Ingram's career declined with the advent of sound in the late 1920s. He continued to work in the film industry through the 1940s, but his later films were not as successful. Ingram died in North Hollywood in 1950 at the age of 58.</p><p>Ingram was a self-taught filmmaker who was known for his exacting standards and attention to detail. He was highly respected by his peers in the industry and was known to be a mentor to other directors, such as Michael Powell, who would go on to direct classics like "Black Narcissus" and "The Red Shoes". Ingram was also a prolific writer, penning several novels and screenplays throughout his career. Despite his success and critical acclaim, Ingram has been largely forgotten by modern audiences, with many of his films lost or in a state of disrepair. However, his contributions to the film industry have not been forgotten, and he is remembered as a pioneering filmmaker who pushed boundaries in terms of racial diversity and representation on screen.</p><p>Ingram was also known for his collaboration with his wife, actress Alice Terry. The two met on the set of "The Prisoner of Zenda" and went on to work together on many films throughout the 1920s. Terry often starred in Ingram's films and was known for her beauty and talent as an actress. Together, they formed a powerful creative partnership that contributed greatly to the success of their films. In addition to his work in Hollywood, Ingram also spent time in Europe filming and directing several films, including "The Magician" (1926) and "Baroud" (1932). Despite facing discrimination and prejudice as a person of color in the film industry, Ingram remained committed to promoting diversity and representation on screen. He was a trailblazer in this regard and paved the way for future generations of filmmakers to pursue similar goals. Today, Ingram's legacy is being rediscovered and celebrated, with renewed interest in his work and contributions to the film industry.</p><p>One of the reasons Ingram's films were so praised for their extravagant sets and costumes was his background in stage design. Before moving to the US, he worked as a stage designer in England and Ireland, which gave him a keen eye for visual storytelling. This background also led him to experiment with new techniques and technologies, such as using matte paintings to create illusions of massive sets and landscapes. Additionally, Ingram was known to be a demanding director who often pushed his cast and crew to their limits. He believed in creating an immersive and authentic experience for audiences, which meant going to great lengths to ensure historical accuracy and attention to detail.</p><p>Despite facing racism and discrimination throughout his career, Ingram was determined to use the power of storytelling to promote equality and social justice. In addition to his work on screen, he was an active member of the NAACP and contributed to several civil rights organizations. His films often challenged stereotypes and celebrated the beauty and dignity of all people, regardless of race or ethnicity. Ingram's dedication to promoting diversity and representation on screen made him a true pioneer in the industry, and his legacy continues to inspire filmmakers today.</p><p></p><p>
