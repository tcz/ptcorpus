				<h1>
											Turkish
						music stars died at age
						40
									</h1><p>Here are 3 famous musicians from Turkey died at 40:</p><h2>Abdullah Çatlı</h2><p><strong>Abdullah Çatlı</strong>
(June 1, 1956		Nevşehir Province-November 3, 1996			Susurluk)


was
a Turkish
personality.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Gökçen Çatlı and Selcen Çatlı.

						</p><p>However, Abdullah Çatlı was not just any ordinary citizen of Turkey. He was a notorious criminal and a prominent figure in the country's underworld during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Çatlı was the founder and leader of the Grey Wolves, a far-right Turkish nationalist organization that was involved in numerous violent activities, including bombings, assassinations, and drug trafficking.</p><p>In addition to his criminal activities, Çatlı was also known to have close ties to several high-ranking officials in the Turkish government and intelligence community. The revelation of these connections sparked a major scandal in Turkey when Çatlı was killed in a car accident along with a police chief and a legislator in what would later be known as the Susurluk incident.</p><p>The Susurluk scandal exposed the deep-rooted corruption and collaboration between the state and organized crime in Turkey, and it remains one of the most significant moments in the country's recent history. Today, many in Turkey still view Çatlı as a symbol of the nation's troubled past and the need for greater transparency and accountability in government.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in traffic collision.

a Turkish
politician.

		Mahpeyker Enver Hanımsultan, Turkan Enver Hanımsultan and Ali Enver Beyefendi.

						</p><p>Enver Pasha was one of the prominent leaders of the Young Turk Revolution and played a significant role in the formation of the Ottoman Empire's modern army. He served as a military officer during World War I, and was appointed as the Ottoman Empire's Minister of War in 1914. During his tenure, he oversaw the Ottoman Empire's involvement in the war and was responsible for several military campaigns.</p><p>However, Enver Pasha's military campaigns were unsuccessful, resulting in significant losses for the Ottoman Empire. He was also accused of committing war crimes, particularly against the Armenian population. Enver Pasha was one of the principal architects of the Armenian Genocide, which resulted in the deaths of over a million Armenians.</p><p>Following the Ottoman Empire's defeat in World War I, Enver Pasha fled to Germany and later to Soviet Russia. He attempted to form an army to fight against the new Turkish government, but his efforts failed, and he was eventually killed in a battle with Bolshevik forces in 1922. Today, he remains a controversial figure, with some regarding him as a national hero and others as a war criminal.</p><p></p><p>
