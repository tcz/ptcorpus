									</h1><p>Here are 1 famous musicians from Honduras died before 35:</p><h2>James Carney</h2><p><strong>James Carney</strong>
(April 5, 2015		Chicago-April 5, 1983			Honduras)


was
a Honduran
priest.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work as a human rights advocate and social activist during a time of political turmoil in Honduras. Carney arrived in Honduras as a Maryknoll missionary in 1961, and quickly became involved in efforts to support peasant farmers and other marginalized communities in the country. He later joined the guerrilla forces fighting against the Honduran government, and is believed to have died during a confrontation with the military on April 5, 1983. Despite his controversial and sometimes risky work, Carney is remembered as a champion of social justice and a tireless advocate for the poor and oppressed. His legacy continues to inspire activists and humanitarians around the world.</p><p>Carney was born in Chicago in 1924 and grew up in a devout Catholic family. He attended the University of Notre Dame and entered the seminary after graduation. In 1954, he was ordained as a priest and joined the Maryknoll order, which specializes in missionary work in developing countries.</p><p>After his arrival in Honduras, Carney became a vocal critic of the oppressive government regime and its treatment of the poor and marginalized. He worked alongside peasant farmers to establish co-ops and other grassroots organizations aimed at improving their living conditions. He was also a vocal opponent of American military intervention in Central America, which he saw as damaging to the region's democratic aspirations.</p><p>Carney's decision to join the guerrilla forces was hotly debated among his fellow missionaries and human rights advocates, but he remained steadfast in his commitment to social justice. His death was a significant blow to the cause, but his legacy has continued to inspire generations of activists fighting for justice and equality in Honduras and beyond.</p><p>Carney's decision to join the guerrilla forces was not made lightly, but rather as a result of his growing frustration with the Honduran government's brutal treatment of marginalized populations. He believed that armed struggle was necessary to achieve meaningful change and worked closely with the Honduran resistance to plan and execute guerrilla operations. In the years leading up to his death, Carney became increasingly involved in the resistance movement and eventually became one of its leaders.</p><p>Carney's death was a profound loss not only for the resistance movement but also for the broader human rights community in Honduras and around the world. His tireless advocacy for justice and commitment to fighting for the rights of the poor and oppressed inspired countless others to take up the cause of social justice. To this day, he remains a celebrated symbol of resistance and a beacon of hope for those fighting for progressive change in Honduras and beyond.</p><p>Despite the controversial and sometimes dangerous nature of his work, Carney was widely respected and admired both in Honduras and abroad. He received numerous awards and honors during his lifetime, including the Gandhi Peace Award in 1983, which was awarded posthumously. His story has been the subject of several books and documentaries, including "Father Roy: Inside the School of Assassins," which explores his involvement in the resistance movement.</p><p>Carney's legacy continues to inspire those who believe in the power of social justice and the importance of fighting for the rights of marginalized communities. His work in Honduras serves as a reminder that even in the face of great adversity, it is possible to make a difference and effect change.</p><p></p><p>
