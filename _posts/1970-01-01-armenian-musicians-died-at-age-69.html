He served as a member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and was active in various cultural organizations. Although he initially supported the policies of Joseph Stalin, Simonov became disillusioned with Stalinism in the aftermath of the Great Purge and the repression of Soviet intellectuals.</p><p>Simonov's legacy endures in the world of theatre, both in Russia and beyond. The Vakhtangov Theatre, where he served as artistic director, continues to stage productions based on his original concepts and designs. Simonov's ideas about the importance of ensemble acting, theatrical experimentation, and the preservation of cultural heritage continue to influence theatre practitioners around the world.</p><p></p><p>
