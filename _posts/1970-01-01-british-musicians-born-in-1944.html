His parents were Jewish refugees who had fled Germany during the Holocaust.

Kennedy's presidential campaign in 1968 and later served as a campaign aide to Ohio Senator George McGovern. He was elected to the Cincinnati City Council in 1971 and later became the city's mayor from 1977 to 1978.</p><p>In 1997, Springer made a foray into politics once again, running for the U.S. Senate from Ohio as a Democrat but ultimately losing the race to Republican Senator Mike DeWine.</p><p>Springer has also been active in philanthropy and has supported many causes, including children's charities and cancer research. He has worked closely with the Muscular Dystrophy Association and in 2018 was awarded the MDA's Lifetime Achievement Award.</p><p>Despite his many endeavors, Jerry Springer will likely always be most remembered for his controversial talk show and its often outrageous content.
