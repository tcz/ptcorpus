(February 25, 1834		Sutton Forest-April 28, 1872			Sutton Forest)


was
an Australian
writer and novelist.


					</p><p>Atkinson was one of the first female Australian born authors to achieve considerable recognition in her lifetime. Her writings focused mostly on the Australian landscapes, flora and fauna, and she was an accomplished artist and naturalist. Atkinson was also a key figure in the women's rights movement in Australia, and advocated for greater female access to education and the right to vote. She published several books and articles, including her most well-known work, "Gertrude the Emigrant," which depicts the struggles of an English woman trying to adapt to life in the Australian bush. Her contributions to Australian literature and culture are still celebrated today, and she is regarded as a pioneer in both fiction writing and environmental conservation.</p><p>Atkinson was born into a wealthy family, and her father was a prominent pastoralist and attorney in New South Wales. She was homeschooled by her mother and grew up with a deep love and appreciation for nature, spending much of her childhood exploring the forests and rivers around Sutton Forest. At a young age, Atkinson began writing for newspapers and magazines, and by her early twenties, she had become a respected nature writer in her own right.</p><p>In addition to her literary pursuits, Atkinson was also involved in the political and social issues of the day. She was an active Methodist and helped establish the first local chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Throughout her life, she spoke out about the need for women's rights in Australia, and worked tirelessly to improve access to education and job opportunities for women.</p><p>Despite her many accomplishments, Atkinson's life was cut short at the age of 38. She suffered from poor health for much of her life, and died of heart failure in her family home in Sutton Forest. Today, she is remembered as an important figure in Australian history and culture, and her legacy continues to inspire writers, artists, and advocates for social justice.</p><p></p><p>
						She died as a result of cardiovascular disease.

She also wrote several novels and short stories, including 'The River and the Tree' and 'The Death of a Noblewoman.'</p><p>Despite her success as a writer, Rankin struggled with a longstanding alcohol addiction. She passed away in 1979 at the age of 38 due to complications from cirrhosis of the liver. However, her legacy endures through her literature, which continues to be read and performed worldwide.</p><p>In addition to her writing career, Jennifer Rankin was also an active participant in the feminist movement. She co-founded the Women's Theatre Group in London, an organization that aimed to give voice to women's experiences and perspectives through theatre. Rankin's feminist activism also influenced her writing, with many of her works exploring the struggles and aspirations of women.</p><p>Throughout her life, Rankin was recognized for her literary achievements. In 1969, she was awarded the John Whiting Award for emerging playwrights. She was also a recipient of the British Arts Council Bursary and the Peggy Ramsay Playwriting Fellowship.</p><p>Jennifer Rankin's contributions to literature and theatre continue to be celebrated today. Her works have been adapted into film and television, and her plays are still performed by theatre companies around the world.

(December 21, 1959		Australia-April 5, 1998)


was
an Australian
coach.


					</p><p>He was best known for his work in rugby league, coaching several teams to success in both Australia and England. McRae began his coaching career in the late 1980s as an assistant with the Parramatta Eels before taking on head coaching roles with the Western Suburbs Magpies, South Sydney Rabbitohs, and St Helens in England.</p><p>In 2001, the Shaun McRae Medal was established in his honor, which is awarded to the man of the match in the annual City vs Country Origin rugby league match in Australia. His legacy in the sport continues to be celebrated by fans and colleagues alike.</p><p>McRae was born in Kaputa, Zambia, and grew up in South Australia. He was a talented player in his youth, but suffered a serious knee injury that ended his playing career prematurely. He then turned his attention to coaching and quickly made a name for himself as a dynamic and innovative strategist.</p><p>During his tenure with the St Helens team in England, McRae won the Super League Grand Final twice and also led the team to victory in the Challenge Cup. He was widely regarded as one of the most successful and respected coaches in the sport.</p><p>McRae was tragically killed in a car accident in 1998 at the age of 38. His death was a huge loss to the rugby league community, and he is remembered as much for his character and leadership as for his coaching talents. The Shaun McRae Trophy, which is awarded annually to the winner of the St Helens vs Hull FC match, is another testament to his enduring legacy.</p><p></p><p>
