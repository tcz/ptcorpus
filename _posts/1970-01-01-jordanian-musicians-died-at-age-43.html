					</p><p>Wasfi al-Tal served as Prime Minister of Jordan twice, first from 1962 to 1963 and then from 1965 to 1970. He was also a key figure in the Arab world, serving as the Secretary-General of the Arab League from 1970 until his assassination in 1971. Al-Tal was known for his strong support of Arab unity and his efforts to address the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. His assassination by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) shocked the world and further destabilized the already tense political situation in the Middle East. Despite his controversial policies, Al-Tal is still remembered as a prominent Arab leader and a national hero in Jordan.</p><p>Wasfi al-Tal was born on April 5th, 1919, in Irbid, Jordan, to a prominent political family. He received his early education in Jordan and later attended the American University of Beirut, where he earned a degree in law.</p><p>After graduation, al-Tal returned to Jordan and began his political career, holding various government positions before being appointed as Prime Minister in 1962. During his tenure as Prime Minister, al-Tal implemented a number of economic and social reforms, including the establishment of a National Social Security Fund and the expansion of education and health services.</p><p>In 1967, the Arab-Israeli conflict reached a boiling point with the Six-Day War, in which Jordan suffered a crushing defeat. Al-Tal resigned as Prime Minister in the wake of the conflict, but returned to the post in 1965.</p><p>As Secretary-General of the Arab League, al-Tal worked tirelessly to promote Arab unity and to find a solution to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. His efforts were cut short, however, when he was assassinated in Cairo on November 28th, 1971, by members of the PFLP.</p><p>Al-Talâ€™s legacy lives on in Jordan, where he is remembered as a courageous leader who dedicated his life to the betterment of his country and the Arab world at large.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Wasfi al-Tal was also a prominent military officer, rising to the rank of Major General in the Jordanian Army. He played a key role in the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948, 1956, and 1967, and was a fierce advocate for Arab military cooperation and modernization. </p><p>Al-Tal was also known for his charismatic personality and his ability to connect with people from different walks of life. He was a popular figure in Jordan, and his funeral was attended by tens of thousands of mourners.</p><p>After his death, al-Tal was posthumously awarded the Grand Collar of the Order of the Nile by the Egyptian government, and the Jordanian government named a major street in Amman after him. In 2003, he was also honored with a commemorative stamp issued by the Jordanian Postal Service.</p><p></p><p>
