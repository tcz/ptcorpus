(September 15, 1866		Brussels-January 12, 1930			Marseille)


was
a Belgian
personality.


					</p><p>Henry de Groux was a painter and sculptor, associated with both the Symbolist and the Expressionist movements. He was born into an aristocratic family and began his studies in art in Brussels. In his early career, he was strongly influenced by the works of Rembrandt and Delacroix, but later developed his own unique style characterized by bold, energetic brushstrokes, intense colors, and a focus on emotional expression.</p><p>De Groux was actively involved in the art world of his time and was associated with other prominent artists such as Vincent van Gogh and Edvard Munch. He was also a keen observer of politics and society, and his work often addressed themes such as injustice, poverty, and the cruel aspects of human behavior.</p><p>In addition to his painting and sculpture, de Groux was also an accomplished writer, and published works on art theory and criticism throughout his career. Despite his prolific artistic output, de Groux struggled financially throughout his life, and was largely unrecognized until after his death. Today, he is regarded as one of the most important Belgian artists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p><p>De Groux's style of painting evolved over the course of his career, from his early realistic works to his later abstract and expressionist pieces. He also experimented with different media, such as watercolors and lithographs. In the mid-1890s, he moved to Paris, where he joined the group of artists known as Les XX, which included the likes of James Ensor and Georges Seurat.</p><p>In 1900, de Groux traveled to Morocco, where he was struck by the vibrant colors and culture of the country. This experience had a significant impact on his work, leading him to incorporate more exotic and oriental elements into his paintings. He also became increasingly interested in spiritualism and esotericism, and these themes began to appear in his art.</p><p>Despite his struggles with poverty, de Groux continued to produce art until his death in 1930. His work has been exhibited in galleries and museums throughout Europe, and is held in the collections of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, among others.</p><p>In addition to his art and writings, Henry de Groux was also known for his outspoken nature and his involvement in political and social causes. He was a vocal critic of the Catholic Church and its influence on Belgian society, and was a supporter of the women's suffrage movement and the labor movement. He also participated in political protests and was arrested several times for his activities.</p><p>Despite his controversial views and his struggles with poverty, de Groux was admired by many for his dedication to his art and his unwavering commitment to his beliefs. He is remembered as a deeply passionate and talented artist who left a lasting impact on the world of art and culture.</p><p></p><p>

(February 28, 1911		Lier, Belgium-March 4, 1974			Leuven)


was
a Belgian
scientist and philosopher.


					</p><p>He was a key figure in the study of the works of philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, and is perhaps best known for his efforts in preserving Wittgenstein's manuscripts and unpublished writings. Van Breda spent several years organizing and editing Wittgenstein's notes and manuscripts, and eventually published the Nachlass, a collection of Wittgenstein's previously unpublished works. Van Breda's work on Wittgenstein's Nachlass was a major contribution to the understanding of Wittgenstein's philosophy, and helped establish him as one of the most significant philosophers of the 20th century. In addition to his work on Wittgenstein, Van Breda also made important contributions to the field of phenomenology, and is credited with bringing the works of philosopher Edmund Husserl to the attention of the wider academic community.</p><p>Van Breda completed his PhD in Philosophy at the Catholic University of Leuven in 1938, and after the Second World War, he founded the Husserl Archives at the same university. The archives contain the complete works of Edmund Husserl, and were originally founded to preserve and promote the work of Husserl, who was a mentor and influence on Van Breda's own philosophical work. As well as his work on Wittgenstein and phenomenology, Van Breda had a deep interest in the philosophy of science, particularly the philosophy of mathematics, and published several papers on these topics. He was a respected and influential figure in the world of contemporary philosophy, and his work is still studied and cited by scholars today.</p><p>Van Breda was born in Lier, Belgium, in 1911. He grew up in a Catholic family, and was educated at a Jesuit school in Turnhout. After completing his secondary education, he went on to study philosophy and theology at the Catholic University of Leuven, where he was introduced to the works of Edmund Husserl. He completed his doctorate in philosophy in 1938, with a thesis on the phenomenology of time consciousness.</p><p>During the Second World War, Van Breda worked as a resistance fighter, and was imprisoned by the Nazis in 1943. He spent three years in various concentration camps, including Dachau, before being liberated by American forces in 1945.</p><p>After the war, Van Breda returned to Leuven and founded the Husserl Archives. He began collecting and organizing Husserl's manuscripts, correspondence, and other writings, with the aim of preserving Husserl's legacy and promoting his work. The archives quickly became a major center of research and scholarship in the field of phenomenology, and attracted scholars from around the world.</p><p>In addition to his work on Husserl and Wittgenstein, Van Breda also made important contributions to the philosophy of science. He was a staunch defender of the idea that scientific theories are not necessarily descriptive of the world, but are rather frameworks for understanding it. He believed that the philosophy of science was intimately connected to the philosophy of language, and that a proper understanding of language was essential for a proper understanding of science.</p><p>Van Breda's work on Wittgenstein and Husserl helped establish him as one of the leading figures in 20th-century philosophy. He was a highly respected and influential scholar, and his work continues to shape the way we think about language, science, and the nature of human experience. Van Breda died in Leuven in 1974, leaving behind a rich legacy of philosophical inquiry and scholarship.</p><p></p><p>

He later became one of the leaders of the Belgian symbolist movement, which rejected the naturalistic approach of the academic art of the time and sought to express the spiritual and subconscious aspects of human experience through highly stylized and diverse forms of art.</p><p>Khnopff's art was also influenced by his interest in literature, philosophy, and mysticism, and he often incorporated these themes into his works. His famous painting, "The Caress," for example, depicts a woman caressing a statue, which has been interpreted as a symbol of the human desire for ideal beauty and the inability to attain it.</p><p>Khnopff was also an important figure in the Art Nouveau movement and designed furniture, interiors, and decorative objects that were characterized by their sinuous lines, their use of organic forms, and their incorporation of natural motifs such as flowers and butterflies.</p><p>Today, Khnopff's works are held in major collections around the world, including the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, the Tate Gallery in London, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. His influence on Symbolism, Art Nouveau and the development of modern art in Europe continues to be celebrated today.</p><p>Khnopff was born into a wealthy family, which allowed him to pursue his artistic interests without financial constraints. He traveled extensively throughout Europe, studying the art of various cultures and refining his own style. In addition to painting, he also wrote poetry and essays on art.</p><p>Throughout his career, Khnopff maintained a strong reputation as an artist, exhibiting his works in major galleries and winning numerous awards and honors. He was a member of various artistic societies, including Les XX and La Libre Esthétique, and was highly regarded by his peers.</p><p>Despite his success, Khnopff was known for his reclusive and introverted personality. He rarely gave interviews and preferred to let his art speak for itself. He lived a solitary life in his Brussels home, which he designed and decorated to reflect his artistic vision.</p><p>Khnopff's legacy continues to inspire artists and art enthusiasts around the world, with his works still being lauded for their innovative use of symbolism, composition, and mood.</p><p></p><p>
