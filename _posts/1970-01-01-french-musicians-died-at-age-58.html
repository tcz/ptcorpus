		a.k.a. Dr. Alfred Moquin-Tandon

	
was
a French
naturalist, physician and writer.


					</p><p>He studied medicine in Montpellier and became a professor of natural history at the University of Poitiers. Moquin-Tandon published several influential books on zoology and botany, including "Elements of Terrestrial Zoology" and "History of Nature". He was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1855 for his contributions to science. Moquin-Tandon was also a member of the French Academy of Sciences and played a significant role in the development of paleontology as a scientific discipline.</p><p>In addition to his works on zoology and botany, Moquin-Tandon was also a prominent figure in parasitology. He made significant contributions to the understanding of the life cycles and behaviors of various parasites and his work on the subject was highly regarded. Moquin-Tandon was also an avid collector of natural specimens and amassed an extensive collection of shells, fossils, and other specimens throughout his lifetime.</p><p>Moquin-Tandon's legacy in the field of natural history and science in general is significant, and he is remembered as a pioneering figure in the study of many different aspects of the natural world. His works continue to be studied and referenced today by researchers and scientists around the world.</p><p>Moquin-Tandon was born into a family of physicians and was influenced by his father's interest in natural history from a young age. He began collecting and studying insects as a child and later expanded his interests to include other areas of natural science. After completing his medical studies, Moquin-Tandon worked as a physician for a brief period before turning his attention to teaching and research in natural history. </p><p>In addition to his scientific contributions, Moquin-Tandon was also involved in the political and social issues of his time. He was an active supporter of the French Revolution of 1848 and served as a member of the Constituent Assembly. Moquin-Tandon also advocated for the importance of science education and was instrumental in the founding of several scientific institutions, including the Société des Sciences Naturelles de la Charente-Inférieure.</p><p>Despite his significant contributions to science, Moquin-Tandon's work was not without controversy. He often found himself in disagreement with other prominent naturalists of his time, particularly with regard to the classification of species. Moquin-Tandon also faced criticism for his support of Lamarckian evolution, a theory that was largely discredited in the decades following his death.</p><p>Despite these controversies, Moquin-Tandon's contributions to the study of natural history and science continue to be recognized and celebrated today. His dedication to the pursuit of knowledge and his contributions to the development of numerous scientific disciplines have left a lasting impact on the field of natural history and on the scientific community as a whole.</p><p></p><p>

(December 25, 1753-July 22, 1812)


was
a French
politician.


					</p><p>Louis-Alexandre de Launay, comte d'Antraigues, was born on December 25, 1753, in Carpentras, France. He was a diplomat and politician who served as an agent for the Bourbon royal family during the French Revolution. Launay was a vocal opponent of the revolutionary government and went into exile in various European countries, where he continued to work to restore the French monarchy. </p><p>In addition to his political activities, Launay was a prolific writer, authoring works on history, politics, and literature. He was a close friend of many prominent figures of his time, including the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.</p><p>On July 22, 1812, Launay was assassinated in the town of Riga, Russia, by a man named Johann Gabriel Duvivier. The motives for the assassination are unclear, but some historians have suggested that it may have been related to Launay's involvement in a conspiracy to overthrow Napoleon Bonaparte.</p><p>Launay began his career as a diplomat in the 1770s, serving in various European countries. In 1789, he was appointed as the French ambassador to Naples by King Louis XVI, but was recalled to France after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1792. He then became involved in anti-revolutionary activities and was appointed as an agent for the Bourbon royal family. Launay worked to gather support for the exiled French monarchy and organized several failed attempts to overthrow the French government.</p><p>During his time in exile, Launay wrote extensively on political and historical topics, publishing several books and essays. He was also a prominent figure in European intellectual circles, and was friends with many notable writers and thinkers of the time, including the Marquis de Sade and the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder.</p><p>Launay's assassination was a shock to many of his friends and colleagues. Although the motives behind the killing remain unclear, some historians believe that it may have been related to his involvement in a failed plot to assassinate Napoleon Bonaparte. Despite his controversial political beliefs, Launay is remembered as a talented writer and a key figure in the anti-revolutionary movement of his time.</p><p>Launay's wife, Catherine-Julie-Melchior, also played a prominent role in the French Revolution. She was an influential salon hostess and used her social connections to help her husband's political activities. After his assassination, she continued to work for the restoration of the French monarchy and supported various plots against Napoleon. Catherine-Julie-Melchior outlived her husband by several decades and died in 1836 at the age of 88.</p><p>Launay's literary works include a history of Naples, several political essays, and a play. He also wrote a memoir titled "Mémoires du Comte de Launay," which was published posthumously in 1822. In the memoir, Launay recounted his experiences as a diplomat and his involvement in anti-revolutionary activities. The book is considered a valuable primary source for historians studying the French Revolution.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Launay's legacy is clouded by his association with the Bourbon royal family and his opposition to the French Revolution. Some historians view him as a reactionary figure who sought to turn back the clock on the progress made during the Enlightenment. Others see him as a tragic figure who was caught up in the tumultuous events of his time and became a victim of political violence.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in assassination.

(December 12, 1821		Rouen-May 8, 1880			Canteleu)

	
		otherwise known as Flaubert

	
was
a French
writer, novelist and playwright.


					</p><p>Flaubert is considered one of the most influential writers in Western literature, known for his realistic portrayal of complex characters and intricate narrative style. His best-known work, Madame Bovary, was initially heavily criticized for its explicit depiction of adultery and immorality but is now celebrated as a masterpiece of the 19th century French realism movement. Flaubert's other notable works include Salammbô, Sentimental Education, and The Temptation of Saint Anthony. He was a member of the French Academy and had a significant impact on later writers such as Franz Kafka and Marcel Proust. Flaubert was famously devoted to the craft of writing, often spending years perfecting his prose, and once remarked, "I am a man of forty, but I have not grown up yet."</p><p>Flaubert was born into a wealthy family and received a classical education, which heavily influenced his writing style. Despite his success as a writer, Flaubert often struggled with depression and feelings of loneliness, which he explored in his personal correspondence and journals. He also had several romantic relationships, including one with the writer Louise Colet, which inspired some of his work.</p><p>Flaubert was known for his meticulous attention to detail and his desire for accuracy in his writing. He famously traveled to Egypt in the 1850s to research Salammbô, spending several months exploring ancient ruins and historical sites. He also corresponded with experts in various fields to ensure the accuracy of his writing, which was considered groundbreaking at the time.</p><p>Flaubert's influence on literature continues to be felt today, and many of his works are still considered essential reading for anyone interested in the development of the novel as a literary form. His commitment to realism and his exploration of complex psychological themes paved the way for later writers such as Virginia Woolf and James Joyce, making him one of the most important literary figures of the 19th century.</p><p>Flaubert's writing style, characterized by its attention to detail and meticulous use of language, had a significant impact on the development of modern literature. He is credited with popularizing the use of free indirect discourse, a narrative technique that allows the reader to experience a character's thoughts and feelings through the use of indirect language. This technique has since become a staple of modern fiction.</p><p>Aside from his literary achievements, Flaubert was also a political activist and supporter of democracy. He was involved in several political movements during his lifetime, including the Revolution of 1848 and the Paris Commune of 1871.</p><p>Flaubert's personal life was marked by tragedy, including the deaths of several family members, friends, and lovers. His father died when he was young, and his sister Caroline died shortly after giving birth to a child. He also witnessed the suicide of his close friend, the poet Louis Bouilhet, and the death of his beloved niece, Caroline Commanville. These events had a profound impact on his writing, and themes of loss and grief are often explored in his works.</p><p>Despite his personal struggles, Flaubert remained dedicated to his craft throughout his life. He once remarked, "Writing is a dog's life, but the only life worth living," and his commitment to his art is evident in the enduring influence of his works on literature and culture.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by cerebral hemorrhage.

(January 27, 1735		Geneva-December 8, 1793			Paris)

	
		a.k.a. Etienne Claviere

	
was
a French
politician and banker.


					</p><p>Étienne Clavière was a prominent figure in the French Revolution, advocating for democratic and liberal reforms to the government and society as a whole. He played a key role in establishing the Bank of France in 1793, and was appointed as France's first Minister of Finance that same year. Despite his significant contributions to the revolutionary cause, Clavière's political stance made him a target among the radical Jacobin faction that came to power, ultimately leading to his arrest and eventual suicide while in custody.</p><p>Prior to his involvement in politics, Étienne Clavière worked as a merchant and banker. He made a name for himself in the business world, becoming a successful merchant in Switzerland and eventually moving to France to work for a banking firm. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled financier and used his expertise to help fund the revolutionary cause. </p><p>Clavière was a firm supporter of the abolition of slavery and the establishment of equal rights for all citizens regardless of class or race. He was also a vocal advocate for a more representative democracy and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. Despite his progressive ideals, Clavière's involvement in politics ultimately led to his downfall. </p><p>After being imprisoned by the Jacobins, Clavière wrote a letter to his wife explaining that he had chosen to take his own life rather than face an uncertain future as a prisoner. His death was a tragic loss for those who supported his vision of a more just and equitable society.</p><p>Clavière's contributions to the financial systems of both Switzerland and France were highly significant. He played a key role in the establishment of the Société des Amis des Noirs (Society of the Friends of the Blacks), which sought to abolish slavery throughout France's colonies. He wrote extensively on issues of economics and politics, publishing works such as "De la richesse nationale" ("On National Wealth") and "De la liberté du commerce des grains" ("On the Freedom of Trade in Grain"). Clavière was also instrumental in the creation of the French assignat, a type of paper currency used during the Revolution. His work in economics and finance helped to shape the policies and institutions of post-Revolutionary France. Despite his tragic end, Étienne Clavière remains an important and influential figure in the history of the French Revolution and the development of modern economic thought.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of suicide.

(June 10, 1819		Ornans-December 31, 1877			La Tour-de-Peilz)


was
a French
artist, painter and visual artist.


					</p><p>Courbet was a leading figure in the Realist movement, which rejected the idealized depictions of traditional art in favor of portraying the world as it truly was. He is known for his provocative and often controversial paintings, depicting ordinary people and everyday scenes with a frank and unflinching realism. His most famous works include "The Stonebreakers," "A Burial at Ornans," and "The Origin of the World." Courbet's art and bold opinions made him a polarizing figure in his time, and he was even briefly imprisoned for his role in the Paris Commune of 1871. Today, he is widely recognized as a pioneer of modern art and a key figure in the development of realism as an artistic style.</p><p>Courbet was born into a wealthy family and showed an early interest in art, which led him to move to Paris to pursue his studies. Despite facing criticism from the art establishment, Courbet continued to paint scenes of everyday life and gained a reputation for his rebellious attitude towards traditional art. His work was often rejected by the Salon, the official art exhibition of the French Academy, which only heightened his reputation as a controversial figure.</p><p>In addition to his artistic achievements, Courbet was also known for his political activism. He supported socialist causes and was a vocal critic of the French government and the bourgeoisie. His participation in the Paris Commune, an uprising that sought to establish a socialist government in France, led to his brief imprisonment and exile to Switzerland.</p><p>Despite his tumultuous life, Courbet left an enduring legacy as an artist who challenged the conventions of his time and paved the way for the development of modern art. His influence can be seen in the works of later artists such as Édouard Manet and Vincent van Gogh.</p><p>One of Courbet's earliest and most significant works was "The Stonebreakers," which depicts two laborers breaking rocks on a country road. The painting, which was completed in 1849, was seen as a bold departure from the idealized depictions of rural life that were popular at the time. Instead, Courbet portrayed the harsh realities of manual labor with unflinching realism. This painting, along with "A Burial at Ornans," earned Courbet critical acclaim and cemented his reputation as a leader of the Realist movement.</p><p>In addition to his oil paintings, Courbet was also a prolific draftsman and printmaker. He frequently created lithographs and etchings of his paintings, which allowed his work to reach a wider audience. He also experimented with unconventional materials, such as tar and gravel, in his paintings.</p><p>Courbet's legacy was not without controversy, however. His painting "The Origin of the World," a graphic depiction of female genitalia, has been the subject of censorship and controversy since its creation in 1866. The painting is now housed in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and has become a symbol of Courbet's provocative and boundary-pushing art.</p><p>Despite facing rejection and criticism in his lifetime, Courbet remained committed to his vision of art as a reflection of reality. His passionate and often confrontational approach to art and politics ensured that his legacy would endure for generations to come.</p><p></p><p>

(March 27, 1952		Paris-February 3, 2011			Paris)

	
		a.k.a. Marie Schneider, Marie Christine Gélin or Marie Christine Schneider

	
was
a French
actor.


					</p><p>Maria Schneider was known for her role in the controversial film "Last Tango in Paris" (1972), directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, where she starred alongside Marlon Brando. She began her acting career at the age of 19, and went on to work with other notable directors such as Michelangelo Antonioni and Jacques Rouffio. Despite her success, Schneider publicly reported struggles with drug addiction, depression, and sexual assault. Later in life, she became an advocate for mental health, substance abuse treatment, and the #MeToo movement. She was awarded the "Chevalier" (Knight) of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Minister of Culture in 2008 for her contributions to the arts.</p><p>Throughout her career, Maria Schneider appeared in over two dozen feature films, including "The Passenger" (1975) and "The Garden of Delights" (1977). In addition to acting, she also worked as a model and musician, releasing her debut album "Maria Schneider and the Orchestra" in 1994. As an advocate for mental health and addiction treatment, she shared her personal experiences with addiction and therapy openly in interviews and on talk shows. She also spoke out about the trauma she experienced during the filming of "Last Tango in Paris", particularly during a controversial rape scene with Brando which she claimed was not scripted and left her feeling violated. Despite the difficulty of her personal experiences, Schneider's work as an actor and activist continue to inspire and influence artists and advocates today.</p><p>Schneider was born into a family of artists; her mother was a bookshop owner and her father was a French actor Daniel Gélin. She grew up in Paris and attended drama school at age 15. Despite her family's disapproval, she dropped out of school and pursued an acting career. In 1970, at age 18, Schneider was discovered by director Roger Vadim and cast in her first film, "Madly". It was Vadim who introduced her to Bertolucci, who then cast her in "Last Tango in Paris". </p><p>Following the success of "Last Tango in Paris," Schneider struggled with the sudden fame and attention. She turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with her depression and addiction, which eventually led to her being labeled a "difficult" actress to work with. She continued to act in films throughout the 1970s and 1980s, but her substance abuse issues began to affect her career. In the mid-1980s, Schneider entered rehab and successfully overcame her addiction.</p><p>After completing rehab, Schneider continued to act in films, but also became involved in activism. She worked with organizations that focused on addiction treatment and mental health, and spoke out about the importance of seeking help for these issues. She also became a vocal advocate for the #MeToo movement, using her own experiences to raise awareness about sexual assault and the abuse of power in the entertainment industry.</p><p>In her personal life, Schneider was known for her love of music and often played the guitar and sang. She released two albums, "Maria Schneider and the Orchestra" in 1994 and "Insomni C.D." in 2009. She also continued to act in films until her death in 2011, at the age of 58, due to cancer.  Overall, Maria Schneider left a lasting impact on the film industry and the fight for mental health and substance abuse treatment.</p><p></p><p>

(March 13, 1593		Vic-sur-Seille-January 30, 1652			Lunéville)


was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>He was a Baroque painter who is known for his use of chiaroscuro, a technique in which light and shadow are contrasted to create a dramatic effect. La Tour's style was influenced by Caravaggio and he often depicted religious subjects with an emphasis on the physiognomy and emotional states of his subjects. Despite his talent, La Tour's work was largely forgotten until the 20th century when it was rediscovered and he was recognized as one of the great painters of the 17th century. Today, his paintings are highly sought after and can be found in major museums around the world.</p><p>La Tour was born in the small town of Vic-sur-Seille in Lorraine, France. He was the oldest son of a baker and he initially trained as a painter in his hometown. Later on, he studied under a Dutch painter, Daniel Dumonstier, in Paris. Although he spent most of his life in Lorraine, La Tour's exact whereabouts during certain periods are unclear. For example, there is a gap in the records between 1621 and 1627 when he may have been abroad, possibly in Italy.</p><p>La Tour's most famous works include "The Cheat with the Ace of Clubs", "The Penitent Magdalene", and "The Newborn Christ". Many of his paintings feature characters illuminated by a single source of light, which adds to the dramatic effect of his work. He often worked on small canvases, which was unusual for the time, but may have been a practical necessity as he was based in a relatively remote part of France.</p><p>Despite his success during his lifetime, La Tour's reputation waned after his death and by the 19th century he was largely forgotten. However, in the 20th century, his works were rediscovered and he was recognized as one of the great painters of the 17th century.

(September 27, 1507		Montpellier-July 30, 1566			Réalmont)


was
a French
physician and naturalist.


					</p><p>Rondelet was a prominent figure in the scientific community during the Renaissance period, who made significant contributions to the field of marine biology. He worked as a professor of medicine at the University of Montpellier, where he taught anatomy, surgery and botany. Rondelet's most notable work, "Libri de piscibus marinis," is considered one of the earliest and most thorough publications on fish anatomy and classification. He was also known for his research on sea monsters and the medicinal properties of marine life. In addition to his scientific pursuits, Rondelet was an accomplished linguist, proficient in Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic. His translations of scientific works from these languages contributed greatly to the dissemination of knowledge throughout Europe. Rondelet's legacy lives on in the many species of marine life named after him, including the Rondeletia, a genus of marine fish.</p><p>Rondelet was born in Montpellier in 1507, where he spent his early life before moving to Paris to study medicine. He received his medical degree from the University of Paris before returning to Montpellier to practice medicine and teach at the university. Rondelet was highly respected by his colleagues and was often consulted by the French monarchy on matters related to science and medicine. Throughout his career, he published numerous works on biology, zoology, and medicine, cementing his reputation as a leading authority in the field.</p><p>Rondelet also had a keen interest in botany and collected many specimens of plants from around Europe. His botanical studies resulted in the publication of the "De la nature des plantes," a work that describes the characteristics and attributes of various plants. Rondelet was also a pioneer in the use of microscopy for scientific study, using it to examine specimens of marine life and identify new species.</p><p>During his career, Rondelet mentored several notable scientists, including the famous French botanist Pierre Richer de Belleval. Rondelet’s influence on the scientific community was immense, and his works continued to be studied long after his death. He passed away in 1566 in Réalmont, France, after contracting dysentery during a trip to see his son.</p><p>Rondelet's impact on the field of marine biology was significant, and his work paved the way for future scientific advancements. His classification system for fish, in particular, was instrumental in the development of modern taxonomy. Rondelet's research was not limited to marine life, however, and he conducted studies on a diverse range of subjects, including the structure and function of the human body. His expertise in both medicine and natural history allowed him to make important connections between these two fields. Rondelet's contributions to science were honored during his lifetime, and he received numerous awards and accolades from his peers. Despite his many accomplishments, Rondelet remained humble and dedicated to his work until the end of his life. Today, he is remembered as one of the great scientists of the Renaissance period, whose legacy continues to inspire new generations of researchers and scholars.</p><p></p><p>

(March 22, 1834		Montauban-July 21, 1892			Sèvres)


was
a French
novelist.


					</p><p>Born into a family of artists, Léon Cladel was initially trained to be a painter, but he soon discovered his passion for writing. He published his first novel, "Ompdrailles, le tombeau des lutteurs" in 1879, which received critical acclaim and established him as a successful writer. He went on to write several other novels, including "Le Bouscassié" and "Histoire de Giscard d'Estaing", which further established his reputation as an important figure in the French literary scene.</p><p>In addition to his works of fiction, Cladel also wrote essays and theatrical works. He was known for his vivid and descriptive writing style, which often explored the darker aspects of human nature. Although his work was widely read during his lifetime, he fell out of favor in the years following his death, but has recently experienced a resurgence of interest among literary scholars and enthusiasts.</p><p>Cladel was a leading figure in the literary movement known as Naturalism, which emerged in France during the 19th century. The movement sought to portray a realistic and objective portrayal of French society, often focusing on the lives of the working class. Cladel's works explored the lives of peasants and other marginalized groups, while also probing the depths of human emotion and suffering.</p><p>In addition to his literary work, Cladel was also an active participant in the political and cultural life of his time. He was associated with the anarchist movement and was a close friend of the painter Gustave Courbet, who shared his commitment to social justice and radical politics.</p><p>Cladel's legacy as a writer and cultural figure continues to be debated by scholars and critics today. Some see him as a pioneering figure in French literature, while others view his work as deeply problematic and out of step with contemporary values. Nonetheless, there is no denying that his contributions to the world of literature were significant, and his work remains an important part of the French literary canon.</p><p>Despite his success as a writer, Léon Cladel faced significant personal struggles throughout his life. He suffered from poor physical and mental health, and was plagued by financial difficulties. His upbringing in a family of artists also contributed to a sense of instability and insecurity, as he struggled to establish his own identity as a writer in the shadow of his more famous relatives.</p><p>Cladel's work was admired by many of his contemporaries, including the novelist Émile Zola, who praised him for his "lyricism and intensity" in depicting the lives of ordinary people. However, as the literary climate in France began to shift in the late 19th century, Cladel's style fell out of fashion, and he was largely forgotten by the literary establishment.</p><p>In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Cladel's work, particularly among scholars of Naturalism and other 19th-century literary movements. His novels and essays continue to be studied for their insight into the social and cultural landscape of France during this period, and for their exploration of the human psyche in all its complexity and darkness. Despite the challenges he faced during his lifetime, Léon Cladel remains a singular and enduring presence in the history of French literature.</p><p></p><p>
