His legacy lives on with the discovery of several new species of animals and plants that he identified during his expeditions, many of which have been named in his honor. In commemoration of his work, the Royal Society of London awarded him the Gold Medal in 1904, a year after his death.</p><p>Fea's interest in exploration and nature began at a young age, and he later pursued his passion by attending the University of Turin, where he received a degree in natural sciences. He then began his career as a zoologist, working as a researcher for the Museum of Zoology in Turin. Fea's first major expedition was in 1879 when he explored the Albanian coastline and the interior of the country, collecting and studying animal specimens. In 1880, he joined an expedition to Congo organized by the International Association of the Congo, where he researched and cataloged numerous plant and animal species.</p><p>In 1885, Fea embarked on his third expedition, this time to Guinea, where he collected over 60 mammal and bird specimens, including some that were entirely new to science.

Many of his works were lost or destroyed over time, and some of his paintings were even misattributed to other artists. However, recent scholarship has shed new light on his life and artistic achievements, and he is now recognized as one of the most important painters of the Italian Renaissance.</p><p>Ortolano's works continue to inspire contemporary artists and art lovers alike, and his influence can be seen in the still life paintings of artists like Giorgio Morandi and Paul Cézanne.
