(April 5, 2015-April 5, 1980)


was
a South African
personality.


					</p><p>Makoma Modjadji was known as the Rain Queen, an important cultural figure in the Balobedu tribe of South Africa. She was the first woman to hold the title of Rain Queen, a position hereditary in her family for over 200 years. As Rain Queen, it was believed that she had the power to control the clouds and bring rain to the region. Modjadji was respected not only for her mystical abilities but also for her leadership and wise counsel. She was a strong advocate for the rights of her people and worked to unite the tribes of the region. Modjadji's legacy as the Rain Queen continues to this day, with her successors continuing her traditions and responsibilities. She is remembered as a powerful and influential figure in South African history.</p><p>Modjadji was born into a family of royalty as the daughter of Rain Queen Mokope Modjadji. She inherited the title at the age of 25 after the death of her mother in 1943. During her reign, Modjadji maintained the tribe's cultural practices and was known for leading a secluded life in the Modjadji Reserve. Despite the isolated lifestyle, she had a substantial impact on the political and social landscape in South Africa. She worked to preserve the customs and traditions of her people and was a key figure in the eventual recognition of the Balobedu tribe by the South African government in 1972. Modjadji was also involved in various community development projects, including the establishment of a hospital and schools in her region. Her remarkable legacy as the Rain Queen continues to inspire generations of South Africans, especially women, who look up to her as a symbol of strength, wisdom, and leadership.</p><p>Throughout her life, Makoma Modjadji faced many challenges and obstacles, including opposition from some members of her own tribe who were skeptical of her abilities as Rain Queen. However, she remained steadfast in her beliefs and continued to lead her people with courage and determination. Her influence extended beyond the boundaries of her tribe, as she was respected and admired by people from various cultures and backgrounds.</p><p>In addition to her mystical powers, Modjadji was also known for her knowledge of medicinal plants and their healing properties. She used her expertise to treat members of her community and was credited with saving many lives. She was also a skilled weaver and was known for creating intricate baskets and other woven items.</p><p>Despite her many accomplishments, Makoma Modjadji remained humble and dedicated to her people throughout her life. She passed away on April 5, 1980, but her legacy as the Rain Queen continues to live on. She is remembered as a courageous and visionary leader who used her powers for the betterment of her community and the world around her.</p><p>In 1951, Makoma Modjadji met with South African President Daniel Malan to discuss the classification of the Balobedu tribe as a Bantu homeland, and she was a vocal advocate for the rights of her people. She also played a role in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, using her position as a cultural leader to promote unity and resistance against the oppressive regime. Modjadji's influence extended beyond her lifetime, as she was posthumously awarded the Order of the Baobab by the South African government in 2005 for her contributions to her community and the country. Today, her Rain Queen successors continue to maintain the tribe's traditions and cultural practices, and the royal court remains an important institution in South African society. Makoma Modjadji's life and legacy serve as a powerful inspiration for generations of women and cultural leaders around the world.</p><p></p><p>
