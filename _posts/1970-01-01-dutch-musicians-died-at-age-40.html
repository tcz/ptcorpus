(September 30, 1899		Zeist-June 21, 1940)


was
a Dutch
writer.


					</p><p>Marsman was a poet and writer who played a key role in the Dutch literary movement known as the "jong-proza" in the 1920s, and was associated with the avant-garde magazine "De Vrije Bladen." His work was characterized by its use of symbolism and expressionist language, and included collections of poetry such as "Verzen" (1923) and "Tempel en Kruis" (1939).</p><p>In addition to his literary career, Marsman was also a prominent cultural critic and journalist, contributing to numerous publications including the "Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant" and "Het Vaderland." He was an outspoken advocate for modernism in the arts and argued for a break from traditional forms and conventions.</p><p>Marsman's life was cut short when he drowned in the English Channel during World War II, while attempting to flee the German invasion of France in 1940. Despite his relatively short career, his impact on Dutch literary and cultural history was significant, and he remains widely respected and celebrated to this day.</p><p>Marsman was also known for his political activism, particularly his opposition to fascism and Nazism. In his writing, he spoke out against the rise of authoritarianism and warned of the dangers of extreme nationalism.

His literary contributions and political activism continue to be celebrated as an important part of Dutch cultural heritage.</p><p>Marsman's family moved frequently during his childhood, as his father, who was a businessman, was often transferred to different locations.

After completing his studies in law and Dutch language and literature, he worked briefly as an advertising copywriter before dedicating himself to his literary career.</p><p>Marsman's literary style was deeply influenced by his travels to Italy and Spain in the 1920s, during which he became enamored with the landscapes and cultures of these countries. He incorporated many Mediterranean themes and motifs into his poetry, including classical mythology, Catholicism, and bullfighting. His use of symbolism and allusion was innovative for its time and helped to define the Dutch modernist movement.</p><p>In addition to his poetry and cultural criticism, Marsman also wrote a number of plays and novels, though these are less well-known than his poetry. He was an active member of the Dutch literary community and maintained close friendships with many other prominent writers and intellectuals, including Menno ter Braak, E. du Perron, and Simon Vestdijk.</p><p>Marsman's death at the age of 40 was a profound loss to the Dutch literary and cultural scene, and his legacy has only grown in the years since.

(April 5, 1480		Kimswerd-October 18, 1520			Sneek)


was
a Dutch
pirate.


					</p><p>Donia is also known as "Grutte Pier" in Frisian or "Grote Pier" in Dutch, meaning "Big Pier" in English. He was a farmer and a rebel leader who fought against the Saxon and Hollandic invaders in the Netherlands during the 16th century. Donia was known for his strength and bravery, and he gathered a group of rebels and pirates to fight for the independence of the Frisian people. With his group, he sank dozens of ships, captured towns, and killed hundreds of soldiers during his raids. His most famous battle was the Battle of Zuiderzee, in which he defeated a fleet of Dutch ships. Donia died of natural causes in 1520 and is still celebrated as a folk hero in the Frisian region of the Netherlands.</p><p>Donia was born into a wealthy farming family in the province of Friesland in the Netherlands. He was a large and powerful man, standing at over seven feet tall, and was said to possess enormous strength. Donia became known as a skilled and formidable fighter during his youth, and he was appointed as a captain of the local militia at the age of 23.</p><p>When the Saxons and Hollandic forces invaded Friesland in the early 16th century, Donia led a rebellion against their rule. He became an outlaw and began raiding enemy ships that traveled along the coast. Donia's exploits made him a legend, and he soon became the leader of a group of pirates who fought against the Dutch navy and troops.</p><p>Donia's most famous battle was the Battle of Zuiderzee in 1517. He led a fleet of 20 ships and defeated a much larger Dutch fleet of 70 ships. Donia's tactics were unconventional and effective. He piled his ships with flammable materials and sailed them into the middle of the Dutch fleet, setting them alight and causing chaos and confusion. The Dutch ships were unable to respond, and Donia's fleet was able to attack and destroy them.</p><p>Despite his success, Donia's rebellion was ultimately unsuccessful. He died in 1520, but his legacy as a folk hero and symbol of Frisian independence has endured. Today, the Frisian people still celebrate Pier Gerlofs Donia's life and legend, and he is remembered as a brave and fearsome warrior who fought for his people's freedom.</p><p>Donia's legacy has been commemorated in various forms. One of the most notable tributes to him is a bronze statue erected in his honor in Sneek, Netherlands. The statue depicts Donia holding a sword and standing on a pile of defeated enemies. He is shown as a powerful and imposing figure, befitting his reputation as a warrior.</p><p>In addition to his military prowess, Donia is also remembered for his sense of justice. Legend has it that he once settled a dispute between two farmers by picking up a cow and dividing it in half, giving each farmer his fair share. This story is often told to illustrate Donia's sense of fairness and the respect that he held for the law.</p><p>Throughout his life, Donia remained committed to the cause of Frisian independence, even in the face of overwhelming opposition. Today, he is celebrated as a symbol of the resilience and bravery of the Frisian people, and his story continues to inspire generations of Dutch and Frisian citizens.</p><p></p><p>
