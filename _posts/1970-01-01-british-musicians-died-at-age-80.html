(September 8, 1886		Matfield-September 1, 1967			Heytesbury)

	
		also known as Siegfried Loraine Sassoon or Sassoon, Siegfried

	
was
a British
poet, writer and memoirist.


					</p><p>He first gained popularity for his poems during World War I, often criticizing the war effort and the government's handling of it. Sassoon was a decorated soldier, having served in the military for four years during the war. However, after witnessing the horrors of war firsthand, he became an advocate for peace and was one of the key figures in the anti-war movement. After the war, Sassoon continued to write poetry and novels, many of which were influenced by his experiences during the war. He was also a mentor to other young writers, including Wilfred Owen. In his later years, Sassoon became known for his autobiographical works, including the three-volume Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man. He was awarded the Order of Merit in 1958 and continued to write until his death in 1967.</p><p>Sassoon was born into a wealthy family and was educated at Marlborough College and Cambridge University. He initially pursued a career in law, but his love for literature and poetry led him to abandon his legal studies and pursue writing full-time.</p><p>During World War I, Sassoon served as an officer in the British Army and was awarded the Military Cross for his bravery. However, his experiences in the war left him deeply disillusioned and traumatized. He became determined to speak out against the senseless violence and suffering of war.</p><p>In 1917, Sassoon wrote what is perhaps his most famous poem, "The General", which harshly criticized the military leadership for their indifference to the suffering of soldiers. He also famously refused to return to active duty and instead wrote a letter to his commanding officer declaring his opposition to the war. This act of defiance earned him public attention and admiration, but also led to his being sent to a military hospital to be treated for "shell shock".</p><p>After the war, Sassoon continued to write poetry, as well as novels, biographies, and memoirs. He became a close friend and mentor to the poet Wilfred Owen, who was tragically killed in action just one week before the Armistice was signed in 1918.</p><p>Sassoon's works are known for their powerful anti-war message, as well as their vivid depiction of the lived experiences of soldiers during World War I. Along with poets like Wilfred Owen and Rupert Brooke, he helped to shape the public's understanding of the war and its impact on those who fought in it.</p><p>Today, Sassoon is considered one of the greatest British poets of the 20th century, known for his passionate advocacy for peace and his refusal to remain silent about the horrors he witnessed during the war.</p><p></p><p>

Marks's expertise in cryptography was sought after by the film industry, where he worked as a consultant and screenwriter, writing the script for the acclaimed film "Peeping Tom". He was also a successful playwright, his most famous work being "The End of the Game". Despite his many accomplishments, Marks was known to be a very private person who shied away from the public eye.</p><p>After the war, Leo Marks continued his work in cryptography and even set up his own encryption company. He also wrote several books on the subject, including "Between Silk and Cyanide: A Code Maker's War 1941-1945", which detailed his experiences during WWII. </p><p>Apart from his success in the field of cryptography, Marks was also a talented writer and poet. He wrote several plays and was known for his humorous and satirical style. One of his most famous works was the play "The Big Knife", which was later adapted into a film. Despite his success as a playwright, Marks remained modest about his accomplishments and rarely spoke about his work. </p><p>Leo Marks was awarded the OBE (Order of the British Empire) in 2000 for his services to the country during WWII.

(November 26, 1862		Budapest-October 26, 1943			Kabul)

	
		a.k.a. Marc Aurel Stein or Sir Aurel Stein

	
was
a British
archaeologist.


					</p><p>He was known for his expeditions and discoveries in Central Asia, particularly in the areas that are now modern-day China, Pakistan, and Iran. Stein began his career as a professor of Sanskrit at the University of Cambridge before becoming interested in archaeology. He went on several expeditions, including four to Central Asia, between 1900 and 1930. </p><p>Stein is best known for his discovery of the Diamond Sutra, a Buddhist text dated to AD 868, which is the oldest printed text in the world. He also found other important treasures such as a copy of the Heart Sutra, Tangut script, and many other manuscripts, paintings, and textiles. </p><p>In addition to his archaeological work, Stein was also a skilled linguist and wrote many books and articles about his expeditions and discoveries. He was knighted in 1912 for his contributions to British scholarship and was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Founder's Gold Medal in 1922. Despite having retired in 1933, Stein continued to be engaged in archaeology until his death in 1943.</p><p>Stein's expeditions were not without controversy, as he often removed many artifacts and manuscripts from their original locations, which led to accusations of looting. However, he claimed that he was rescuing them from possible destruction, as many of the sites he explored were facing threats of damage or destruction due to political turmoil and environmental factors. Stein's legacy continues to shape the field of archaeology and his discoveries are important for understanding the cultural and historical connections between the East and the West. Today, many of the artifacts he collected are housed in museums around the world, including the British Museum, the National Museum in New Delhi, and the National Museum of Oriental Art in Rome.</p><p></p><p>

was
a British
personality.

He climbed the ranks quickly, serving in Europe and the Caribbean before being sent to North America. In addition to his military duties, Amherst was also an accomplished artist and collector of natural specimens. He was a fellow of the Royal Society and corresponded with other scientists and intellectuals of his time.</p><p>Amherst's views on Native Americans have been the subject of much criticism, with some arguing that his policies were genocidal. However, it is important to note that his tactics were not unique at the time and were part of a broader pattern of European colonialism. In recent years, there has been renewed attention on Amherst's legacy, with some calling for his name to be removed from public spaces and institutions.</p><p>Despite these controversies, Amherst remains an important figure in British military history, and his contributions to the nation's victories in the Seven Years' War cannot be overlooked. His strategic brilliance helped turn the tide of the conflict and secure British dominance in North America.</p><p></p><p>

(February 10, 1920		London-March 26, 2000			South Northamptonshire)

	
		also known as Alexander Comfort or Dr. Alex Comfort

	
was
a British
physician, writer, gerontologist and author.


					</p><p>He was noted for his research on aging, biology of aging, and psychological and social aspects of aging. Comfort authored over 50 books, including several novels and volumes of poetry, but he is perhaps best known for his 1972 book, "The Joy of Sex," which became a bestseller and a cultural phenomenon. In addition to his writing, Comfort was an anarchist and pacifist who advocated for social justice and nuclear disarmament. He spent his later years in seclusion on a farm in England, where he continued to write and study the science of aging until his death in 2000.</p><p>Comfort was born in London to a Jewish family that valued education and intellectual pursuits. He attended prestigious schools and later obtained his medical degree from the University of Cambridge. During World War II, he served as a conscientious objector and worked in hospitals and as a medical examiner for the British government. </p><p>After the war, Comfort became increasingly interested in social and political issues. He wrote about his anarchist and pacifist beliefs in his books and became involved in various political campaigns. In the 1950s, he was blacklisted in the United States for his socialist views and was refused entry into the country.</p><p>Comfort's research on aging and the biology of aging was groundbreaking and earned him international recognition. He believed that aging was a natural process that should be studied and understood, rather than feared and avoided. He advocated for improving the quality of life for elderly people and encouraging them to stay active and engaged in their communities.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding "The Joy of Sex," Comfort considered it one of his least significant works. He believed that it was important to destigmatize sex and promote sexual education, but he also felt that the book had overshadowed his other accomplishments.</p><p>In addition to his writing and activism, Comfort was a skilled pianist and composer. He was also a devoted husband to his wife, Jane, who was an artist and fellow radical. Together, they raised a family and shared a lifelong commitment to social justice and personal freedom.</p><p></p><p>
