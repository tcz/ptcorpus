						</p><p>Flanders is best known for his partnership with Donald Swann, with whom he wrote and performed comedic songs, most famously "The Hippopotamus Song (Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud)". He also wrote a number of plays, including "The Mating Game" and "A Piece of Cake". Flanders began his career in the Army during World War II, before moving on to work in radio and then television. He passed away at the age of 53 due to a brain hemorrhage while on holiday in Wales. Despite his relatively short career, Flanders left behind a lasting legacy in British comedy and entertainment.</p><p>Flanders was born into a family of writers and journalists, and he initially pursued a career in journalism himself. However, his interest in performing led him to join the Army's entertainment division during World War II, where he first met Swann. The two began collaborating on comedic songs and sketches, which they eventually performed on stage and in various media.</p><p>In addition to his work with Swann, Flanders also wrote and performed solo projects, including a one-man show based on the life of Oscar Wilde. He also wrote and appeared in several films and TV shows, including the British comedy series "At Last the 1948 Show".</p><p>Flanders was known for his clever wordplay and sharp wit, and his comedic songs and sketches often satirized British society and politics. He was awarded a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in 1973 for his contributions to the arts.</p><p>After his death, Flanders' daughter Stephanie became a prominent journalist and broadcaster, serving as the BBC's economics editor and later as head of economics at Bloomberg News. His other daughter, Laura, is a progressive political commentator and talk show host in the United States.</p><p>Flanders was diagnosed with polio at the age of 21, which resulted in him having to use crutches for the rest of his life. Despite this, he continued to perform and even incorporated his disability into his comedy sketches. He was known for his irreverent sense of humor and his ability to make audiences laugh at themselves and their own prejudices.</p><p>In addition to his work in comedy, Flanders was an active member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and was involved in various other political causes throughout his life. He was a supporter of the Labour Party and campaigned for their candidates during elections.</p><p>Flanders' legacy continues to be felt in British comedy and entertainment today. His partnership with Swann is still celebrated for its clever wordplay and satirical humor, and his solo work continues to inspire new generations of performers. Flanders is remembered as a talented writer, performer, and social commentator who left an indelible mark on British culture.</p><p>Flanders and Swann's most famous song, "The Hippopotamus Song (Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud)", was first performed in 1957 and quickly became a hit in the UK and beyond. Other popular comedic songs by the duo include "The Gasman Cometh" and "The Gnu Song", both of which showcased Flanders' knack for wordplay and Swann's musical talents.</p><p>In addition to his work in comedy and entertainment, Flanders was also an accomplished writer of plays and musicals. "The Mating Game", which he co-wrote with Donald Swann, was a hit on London's West End in the 1960s, while "A Piece of Cake" was a popular radio play that was later adapted for television.</p><p>Flanders is also remembered for his contributions to the world of vocal harmony singing. He was a member of a small, informal group called The Ivy League, which included other notable British performers such as John Dankworth and Cleo Laine.</p><p>Despite his success and popularity as a performer and writer, Flanders was known for his humility and lack of ego. He once famously said, "If people leave a performance saying, 'What a wonderful show', to each other, and not knowing the names of the performers, then I have done my job."</p><p></p><p>
