									</h1><p>Here are 13 famous musicians from Poland died at 41:</p><h2>Jerzy Kukuczka</h2><p><strong>Jerzy Kukuczka</strong>
(March 24, 1948		Katowice-October 24, 1989			Lhotse)


was
a Polish
mountaineer.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Maciej Kukuczka and Wojciech Kukuczka.

						</p><p>Jerzy Kukuczka is considered one of the greatest mountaineers of all time, having climbed all fourteen peaks over 8,000 meters, including two ascents of Mount Everest, without the use of supplemental oxygen. He is known for his daring and innovative climbing style, as well as his willingness to take risks in pursuit of his goals. Kukuczka began his mountaineering career in the early 1970s and quickly gained a reputation as a talented and determined climber. Over the course of his career, he set several speed records, including an ascent of the south face of Lhotse in just 24 hours. Despite his many accomplishments, Kukuczka's life was tragically cut short when he fell to his death during a solo climb of Lhotse's south face in 1989.</p><p>Kukuczka was born in the coal-mining region of Silesia, Poland, and worked as a firefighter before focusing on mountaineering full-time. He was a member of the Polish Mountaineering Association and spent much of his early climbing career in the Tatra Mountains. In addition to his mountaineering pursuits, Kukuczka was also an accomplished author, penning several books about his climbing experiences, including "My Vertical World: Climbing the 8000-Metre Peaks" and "Art of Freedom."</p><p>Kukuczka's contributions to the sport of mountain climbing were vast and significant. He was a pioneer in the use of lightweight equipment, such as down jackets and sleeping bags, which allowed climbers to move more quickly and efficiently in high-altitude environments. He also developed innovative climbing techniques, such as the "alpine style" of climbing, which involved scaling mountains with minimal equipment and support.</p><p>Kukuczka's legacy continues to inspire generations of mountaineers around the world. In recognition of his many achievements, the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation created the "Jerzy Kukuczka Mountain Award" in 1995, which is given annually to exceptional climbers who exhibit Kukuczka's spirit of innovation and risk-taking.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of mountaineering.
