He spent the majority of his club career with West Ham United, where he played over 500 games and won the FA Cup in 1964 and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965. </p><p>Moore's crowning achievement, however, came in 1966 when he captained the England national team to victory in the World Cup on home soil. His performance in the final against West Germany is considered one of the greatest individual displays in the history of the tournament. Moore earned a total of 108 caps for England, representing his country at three World Cups (1962, 1966, and 1970) and one European Championship (1968). </p><p>Following his retirement from playing, Moore had a brief and unsuccessful stint as a manager, coaching the lower league clubs Oxford City and Southend United. He remained heavily involved in football through punditry work for television and radio, and was widely respected for his insight and analysis. </p><p>Moore's legacy has endured long after his death, with statues and memorials dedicated to him across the country, and the Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK established in his honour. In 1996, he was posthumously awarded a knighthood, in recognition of his outstanding services to football.</p><p>Moore's talent on the field was recognized by some of the greatest players of his era, including Brazilian legend Pel√©, who famously swapped shirts with him following a match. In addition to his skills as a defender, Moore was admired for his leadership, sportsmanship, and gentlemanly conduct both on and off the pitch. He was known for his calm demeanor and ability to read the game, as well as his precise passing and expert tackling. Despite being a standout player, Moore remained humble throughout his career and was widely praised for his professional and courteous attitude.</p><p>Away from football, Moore was known for his stylish dress sense and was a popular figure in the London social scene. He was married twice, first to Tina Dean in 1962 and later to Stephanie Parlane in 1991. Moore's death at the age of 51 was met with widespread sadness and tributes from the footballing community and beyond.

was
a British
economist and scientist.


					
			
		He had
		four
		children,
		Osman Ricardo, David Ricardo, Mortimer Ricardo and Sarah Ricardo-Porter.

						</p><p>Ricardo is widely recognized as one of the most influential economic thinkers of the 19th century. He is best known for his theories on comparative advantage, which argue that countries should specialize in producing goods in which they have a comparative advantage and trade with other countries for goods in which they have a comparative disadvantage. In addition, Ricardo was a strong advocate for free trade and opposed protectionist policies. He made a fortune as a stockbroker and used his wealth to support political causes, including the abolition of the slave trade and Catholic emancipation. Ricardo's works include "The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation" and "On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation". He died of an infection at the age of 51.</p><p></p><p>Ricardo's economic theories had a profound impact on the development of classical economics and were later embraced by neoclassical economists. He was a member of Parliament representing the borough of Portarlington in Ireland from 1819 to 1823. Ricardo was also a founder of the political movement known as the Bullionist movement, which advocated that paper money should be backed by gold reserves. He was known for his extensive correspondence with other economists of his time, including Thomas Malthus and James Mill. In addition to his economic and political contributions, Ricardo was a fellow of the Royal Society and made significant contributions to the science of geology. His legacy continues to influence economic theory and policy to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(September 1, 1864		Sandycove-August 3, 1916			HM Prison Pentonville)


was
a British
personality.


					</p><p>Roger Casement was a renowned Irish nationalist, diplomat, and human rights activist who is best known for his efforts to end human rights abuses in the Congo Free State and the Amazonian rubber industry. He was also a key figure in the Easter Rising of 1916, which sought to establish an independent Irish Republic.</p><p>Casement began his career as a British Consul and worked in Africa, where he reported on the atrocities committed by King Leopold II of Belgium in the Congo. This led to an investigation and the publication of his famous report titled "The Congo Report", which exposed the brutal treatment of Congolese slaves.</p><p>Later, Casement became involved in investigating the exploitation of Amazonian rubber workers. His work there exposed the inhumane treatment that rubber industry employees faced, which led to the formation of the Putumayo Commission to investigate the abuses.</p><p>Casement eventually turned his attention to Irish nationalism and became a member of the Irish Volunteers, which sought to gain independence for Ireland from British rule. He was one of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising, but after being captured and convicted of treason, he was executed by hanging in HM Prison Pentonville in London.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Roger Casement is remembered for his tireless efforts to fight against exploitative and oppressive regimes, and his commitment to human rights makes him an important historical figure.</p><p>Casement's legacy continues to inspire political and human rights activists around the world. He has been honored posthumously in various ways, including the naming of schools, roads, and public buildings in his honor. In 1965, Casement's remains were repatriated to Ireland and he was given a state funeral, with his burial at Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin.His diaries, which were discovered after his death and contained details about his sexual encounters with men, sparked controversy, as homosexuality was a crime in the UK at the time. Today, some argue that he was unfairly targeted by authorities because of his sexuality, which has led to renewed interest in his life and work.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by hanging.

(November 9, 1922		Debrecen-February 2, 1974			London)


was
a British
philosopher.


					</p><p>He is best known for his contributions to the philosophy of science and mathematics, particularly for his concept of the 'research programme'. Lakatos was a fierce advocate of scientific realism and believed that scientific theories should be judged by their explanatory power and predictive success rather than their correspondence with reality. His notable works include "Proofs and Refutations", "The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes", and "Mathematics, Science and Epistemology". Lakatos was also a key figure in the development of the 'Budapest School' of philosophy, which sought to integrate Marxist thought with contemporary philosophy. He passed away from a heart attack at the age of 51, leaving behind a legacy that continues to influence philosophers and scientists alike.</p><p>Lakatos was born to a Jewish family in Hungary and grew up during a tumultuous time in Europe, marked by the rise of fascism and the onset of World War II. He initially hoped to pursue a career in mathematics, but was prevented from doing so by the war. Instead, he studied philosophy and sociology at the University of Debrecen, ultimately earning a PhD in philosophy from the same university.</p><p>In 1956, Lakatos fled Hungary for the United Kingdom after the Soviet Union invaded to suppress the Hungarian Revolution. He quickly established himself as a prominent philosopher of science, teaching at the London School of Economics and Political Science and developing a reputation as a brilliant and insightful thinker.</p><p>Lakatos was deeply committed to advancing the cause of scientific inquiry and was highly critical of what he saw as the dogmatic and ideologically-driven nature of many scientific theories. He believed that science is a highly creative and iterative process, in which theories are constantly challenged and revised in response to new evidence.</p><p>Despite his early death, Lakatos remains one of the most influential philosophers of science of the twentieth century, and his ideas continue to be widely discussed and debated in academic circles today.</p><p></p><p>
