was
a Bangladeshi
politician.


					
			
		He had
		three
		children,
		Shah Taj Imam Mirza, Enver Mirza and Humayum Mirza.

						</p><p>Iskander Mirza was the first President of Pakistan, serving from 1956 until his overthrow in 1958. Prior to this, he served as the Governor-General of Pakistan from 1955 to 1956. Mirza belonged to a politically prominent family, and his father was a member of the Bengal Legislative Council. He received his education in England and pursued a career in the Indian Civil Service before entering politics.</p><p>As President, Mirza declared martial law in 1958 and appointed General Ayub Khan as the new Prime Minister. However, he soon fell out with Ayub Khan and attempted to dismiss him. This led to a military coup, in which Ayub Khan seized power and Mirza was forced to resign. He subsequently went into exile in London, where he remained until his death in 1969.</p><p>Iskander Mirza played a significant role in the politics of Pakistan, particularly during the country's formative years. He was a member of the All India Muslim League and became one of the founding fathers of Pakistan. After the country gained independence in 1947, he was appointed as the Minister of the Interior in the government of Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan. During his tenure, he worked to improve law and order in the country and played an important role in the integration of the princely states into Pakistan.</p><p>Mirza was a proponent of the concept of "one-unit", which involved the merger of the four provinces of West Pakistan into a single administrative unit. This policy was controversial and eventually led to his downfall, as it alienated political leaders in East Pakistan, who felt they were being marginalized.</p><p>Despite his contribution to the early years of Pakistan's history, Iskander Mirza is often remembered for his role in the country's first military coup. The coup led to decades of military rule in Pakistan and had a profound impact on the country's political development.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Iskander Mirza was also a prolific writer and authored several books on world history and politics. He was fluent in several languages, including English, Urdu, Bengali and Persian. After his exile in London, Mirza remained politically active and continued to advocate for democracy in Pakistan. He founded the Pakistan Democratic Party, which aimed to bring together opposition forces against Ayub Khan's military rule. Mirza's influence on Pakistani politics is still debated today, with some considering him a visionary leader who was ahead of his time, while others view him as a power-hungry politician who contributed to the downfall of democracy in the country.</p><p>Iskander Mirza's family was well-known in British India and had a history of serving in the government. His grandfather, Abdul Latif Mirza, was the mayor of Calcutta and a member of the Bengal Legislative Council. Mirza's father, Fateh Ali Mirza, was a member of the Bengal Legislative Council as well. Iskander Mirza's early education was at the University of Calcutta, and he later went to England to study at the University of Cambridge. After completing his education, he joined the Indian Civil Service and served as a district magistrate in different parts of British India.</p><p>During World War II, Iskander Mirza served in the British Army and was appointed as a staff officer in the Indian Army. He resigned from the army after the war ended and returned to the Indian Civil Service. However, he soon became disillusioned with the British government's policies and became involved in the Indian independence movement. He joined the All India Muslim League, a political party that was advocating for the creation of a separate Muslim state in British India.</p><p>After Pakistan was founded in 1947, Iskander Mirza was appointed as the Minister of the Interior in the government of Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan. He played a key role in the integration of the princely states into Pakistan and worked to improve the country's law and order situation. Mirza's vision of creating a strong, centralized state with a powerful executive was controversial, and many politicians felt that it would lead to a concentration of power in the hands of the government. This conflict eventually led to Mirza's downfall and the end of democracy in Pakistan.</p><p></p><p>
