									</h1><p>Here are 26 famous musicians from the world died at 75:</p><h2>William Walden Rubey</h2><p><strong>William Walden Rubey</strong>
(December 19, 1898		Moberly-April 12, 1974			Santa Monica)


was
an American
geologist.


					</p><p>Rubey is best known for his contributions to the study of geothermal energy and plate tectonics. He obtained his undergraduate degree from the University of Missouri and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1923. He then served as a professor of geology at Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, and the University of Chicago. During his time at the University of Chicago, Rubey conducted research on the properties of rocks and minerals at high temperatures and pressures, which led him to propose the theory of plate tectonics. He also worked as a consultant for several energy companies and the Atomic Energy Commission to study the feasibility of using geothermal energy as a power source. In recognition of his contributions to the field of geology, Rubey was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1966.</p><p>Rubey's legacy also includes his research on nuclear explosions and their effects on the Earth's crust. He was involved in the Manhattan Project during World War II, which aimed to develop the first atomic bomb. Rubey's contributions to the project included studying the feasibility of using nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes, such as creating geothermal reservoirs or excavating minerals. Rubey also served as president of the Geological Society of America and the Seismological Society of America. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. After retiring from the University of Chicago in 1963, Rubey continued to conduct research and write scientific papers until his death in 1974.</p><p>Rubey's research on nuclear explosions led him to publish a highly influential paper in the scientific journal Science in 1951, in which he described how underground nuclear tests could be used to stimulate the flow of natural gas, oil and water from rock formations. This idea of "nuclear fracking" was eventually tested in the 1960s, but was never implemented on a large scale due to concerns about safety and radiation exposure.</p><p>Rubey was also a passionate advocate for science education and outreach. He believed that the public should be informed and engaged in scientific debates and decision-making processes, and he often gave talks and interviews to popular audiences. He authored several popular science books, including "The Earth's Story" (1957) and "The Changing Face of the Earth" (1960), which were widely read and praised for their clear and accurate explanations of complex geological concepts.</p><p>Today, Rubey is remembered as one of the greatest geologists of the 20th century, whose innovative ideas and discoveries revolutionized our understanding of the Earth's history and dynamics. His pioneering work on geothermal energy, plate tectonics, and nuclear explosions laid the foundation for many of the scientific and technological advancements that we take for granted today.</p><p></p><p>
