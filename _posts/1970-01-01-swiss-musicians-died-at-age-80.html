In 1971, he was invited to Israel by Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, to be honored as "Righteous Among the Nations" for his humanitarian efforts. Although he could not attend due to poor health, the honor brought attention to his story and led to a public petition for his pardon.

To this day, Grüninger is remembered as a symbol of selflessness and compassion in the face of oppression.</p><p>Despite being ostracized by his community after being fired from his position and being found guilty of official misconduct, Grüninger remained committed to his beliefs and continued to speak out against injustice.

The book was published posthumously in 1976.</p><p>Grüninger's actions also inspired future generations to stand up for what is right. In 2015, a group of Swiss citizens created the "Grüninger Movement" to honor his legacy and promote the values of compassion and humanity.</p><p>Today, Grüninger's memory is kept alive through various memorials and tributes, including a plaque in the Hefenhofen train station where many refugees were able to escape to safety thanks to his help. His story serves as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there are those who are willing to risk everything to stand up for what is right.</p><p></p><p>
