(July 30, 1944		La Serena, Chile-April 5, 1985)


was
a Chilean
personality.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work as a sculptor, painter, and filmmaker. Hodge studied at the School of Fine Arts at the University of Chile, where he honed his skills as an artist. He became an influential figure in Chilean art and his works explored themes of social commentary and political criticism, often with a surrealist twist. </p><p>Hodge also worked in film and is known for his experimental documentary "El Tiempo..." which captures life in the indigenous communities of northern Chile. Unfortunately, Hodge died at the young age of 40 in a car accident, cutting short a promising career. Nevertheless, his legacy continues to inspire Chilean artists to this day.</p><p>In addition to his artistic pursuits, Roberto Hodge was also a committed activist for social justice and human rights. He was an active member of the Socialist Party of Chile and often used his art to raise awareness about the plight of marginalized communities. Despite his premature death, Hodge's impact on Chilean art and culture is still felt today. In his memory, the Roberto Hodge Foundation was created to provide support for emerging artists and to promote the development of the arts in Chile. Hodge's work has been exhibited and celebrated throughout Chile and internationally as well, and his contributions to the fields of sculpture, painting, and film continue to be appreciated by art lovers everywhere.</p><p>Hodge's unique style often incorporated elements of fantasy and surrealism, which earned him a reputation as a visionary artist. He was heavily influenced by Chilean folk art and incorporated traditional motifs and themes into his works. Hodge's sculptures and paintings often featured distorted human figures or fantastical creatures, which he used to explore themes of identity, memory, and mythology.</p><p>In addition to his work as an artist and filmmaker, Hodge was also a respected art teacher. He taught at several universities and schools throughout Chile and was known for his dedication to his students, many of whom went on to become successful artists in their own right.</p><p>Hodge's contributions to the arts were recognized posthumously when he was awarded the National Art Prize of Chile in 1990. Today, his works can be found in museums and private collections throughout the world, and his legacy as one of Chile's most influential artists continues to be celebrated.</p><p>It should also be noted that Roberto Hodge was a key figure in the Chilean art scene during a time of great political turmoil. In the 1970s, Chile underwent a period of social and political upheaval, with the election of socialist President Salvador Allende and the subsequent military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet. Hodge was a vocal critic of the Pinochet regime and his art often reflected the oppressive nature of the dictatorship. He continued to create art that challenged the status quo even in the face of censorship and persecution.</p><p>Another aspect of Hodge's work was his close affiliation with the "Grupo de los 10" (Group of 10), a collective of artists dedicated to social and political change through their art. Hodge was a founding member of the group, which included other notable Chilean artists such as Carlos Altamirano, Carlos Leppe, and Lotty Rosenfeld.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Hodge's influence on Chilean art remains strong. His work continues to be exhibited and analyzed by scholars, and his dedication to social justice and artistic freedom continues to inspire generations of young artists.</p><p></p><p>
