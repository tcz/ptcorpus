a Russian
composer, film score composer, educator and pianist.


					</p><p>Kosenko was known for his unique and innovative approach to music.

Kosenko also composed music for several films, including "Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors," which is considered a masterpiece of Ukrainian cinema. Despite his success as a composer, Kosenko's life was marked by tragedy. He was arrested by the Soviet authorities in 1936 and charged with political offenses. He was imprisoned for two years and then sent to a labor camp in Siberia. Kosenko died in 1938 in Kiev following a stroke, likely caused by his harsh treatment in the labor camp.

He taught at the Lysenko Music School in Kiev and went on to become a professor at the Kiev Conservatory. Many of his students went on to become notable composers and performers in their own right.</p><p>Kosenko was a strong proponent of Ukrainian cultural and musical identity, and his work played an important role in the development of Ukrainian national music. However, his music was also influenced by broader European musical traditions, particularly those of the Romantic period.</p><p>Despite the hardships he faced in his later years, Kosenko remained committed to his art and continued to compose until his death. Today, he is remembered as one of Ukraine's most important composers and a key figure in the development of Ukrainian national music.</p><p></p><p>
