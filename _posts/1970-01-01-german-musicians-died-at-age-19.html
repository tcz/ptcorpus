personality.


					</p><p>Margot Frank was the older sister of Anne Frank, the famous diarist whose diary chronicles the life of her and her family during their time in hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam. Margot and her family had also fled from Germany to the Netherlands in 1933 to escape persecution from the Nazis. Margot and Anne were both eventually discovered and deported to concentration camps. Margot's death preceded that of Anne, who died a month later in the same camp. Their mother, Edith Frank, also died in Auschwitz. Margot's legacy lives on in her sister's diary and in the countless memoirs, films, and other works that tell the story of the Frank family's struggle for survival during the Holocaust.</p><p>Margot Frank was born in Frankfurt, Germany to Otto and Edith Frank. She was a quiet and studious girl who excelled academically. When the Nazis rose to power in Germany, the family moved to Amsterdam in search of safety. Margot attended a Montessori school and later a Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam. </p><p>During their time in hiding, Margot and Anne often disagreed and had sisterly arguments. However, they were still very close and looked out for one another. They both hoped to one day leave the annex and live a normal life. </p><p>Margot's personality and interests were not as well-known as Anne's because Margot's diary did not survive the war. However, the memories of those who knew her describe Margot as a quiet and gentle person who was kind to others. </p><p>Margot's tragic death at the age of 19 was a loss to her family and the world. However, her legacy continues to inspire people to remember the victims of the Holocaust and work towards a better world.</p><p>After Margot and Anne's arrest, they were first held in Westerbork transit camp before being sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. In October 1944, they were both selected for transport to Bergen-Belsen, where they were reunited with their friends from the annex, including Peter van Pels. Margot became ill with typhus in January 1945 and died in March. Her exact cause of death was never confirmed, but it is believed to have been either typhus or typhoid fever. Margot's untimely death was a devastating blow to her family, particularly to Anne, who was heartbroken by the loss of her beloved sister. Margot is buried in a mass grave at Bergen-Belsen, and her name is inscribed on the family's memorial stone in Bergen-Belsen Memorial park. Margot and Anne's story has continued to inspire people around the world to fight against intolerance and prejudice, and to work towards a more just and peaceful world.</p><p></p><p>
						She died in epidemic typhus.
