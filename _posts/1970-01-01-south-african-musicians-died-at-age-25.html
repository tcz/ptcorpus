(February 27, 1942-December 3, 1967			Observatory, Cape Town)


was
a South African
personality.


					</p><p>Denise Darvall is best known for being the donor of the heart that was transplanted into Louis Washkansky in 1967, which became the world's first successful human-to-human heart transplant. The surgery was performed by Christiaan Barnard and his team at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Darvall was tragically killed in a car accident while crossing a road with her father, and her family made the decision to donate her organs, which ultimately saved Washkansky's life. The success of the transplant made headlines around the world and revolutionized organ transplantation.</p><p>Denise Darvall was born in the town of Bathurst, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. She grew up in East London and had several interests including playing the piano and hockey. Following her father's job, the family moved to Cape Town in 1963. At the time of the accident, Darvall was working as a bank clerk and was engaged to be married.</p><p>After the success of the heart transplant, there was a surge in organ donation and transplantation research around the world. The procedure was not only ground-breaking, but it also raised ethical and philosophical questions about the nature of life and death. Darvall's family later established a trust fund that helped to advance medical research at various institutions.</p><p>Denise Darvall's legacy lives on as a selfless donor who saved the life of another. Today, her memory is celebrated by the medical community and continues to inspire others to consider organ donation.</p><p>In addition to her interests in music and sports, Denise Darvall was also known as an avid reader and a talented artist. She was described by her friends and family as kind and compassionate, with a love for helping others. Her decision to donate her organs was in line with her values of generosity and service to others. After her death, her heart was not the only organ donated - her kidneys and liver were also given to other patients in need. </p><p>The success of the heart transplant was not without controversy, however. Some critics raised concerns about the ethics of taking organs from a deceased person without their consent, or the possibility of donors being declared dead prematurely in order to harvest their organs. However, the procedure opened up new possibilities for saving lives and paved the way for further advancements in medical science. </p><p>In addition to the trust fund established in her honor, Denise Darvall's legacy has also been recognized in other ways.

		also known as Cornelius Gerhardus van Rooyen

	
was
a South African
personality.


					</p><p>He was born in 1946 in the Free State Province of South Africa. Van Rooyen was a notorious criminal and serial killer, who along with his accomplice, Joey Haarhoff, was responsible for the abduction and presumed murder of at least six young girls between 1988 and 1989. Van Rooyen and Haarhoff are believed to have lured the girls to their home in Johannesburg under the pretense of offering them work as models, before killing them and disposing of their bodies. </p><p>Van Rooyen and Haarhoff were eventually apprehended by police in 1990, but Van Rooyen committed suicide in his cell before he could be brought to trial. The case remains one of the most notorious crimes in South African history, and has been the subject of several books and documentaries.</p><p>Van Rooyen was born in the Free State Province of South Africa in 1946. He was raised in a strict Calvinist household and was one of eleven siblings. Van Rooyen trained as a teacher at a young age but turned to a life of crime. He had a history of sexual assault and had been in and out of prison before teaming up with Joey Haarhoff. The duo's killing spree lasted for just over a year, from 1988 to 1989. The search for the missing girls lasted for several years, and some of their bodies were found, but others have never been recovered. The police discovered pictures of the victims in various poses, some of which were naked, in Van Rooyen's residence. Van Rooyen was discovered dead in his cell in 1994, four years after his arrest. The cause of his death is still a mystery, but some speculate that it was a suicide while others believe he was murdered. To this day, the murders of Gert van Rooyen and Joey Haarhoff remain unsolved.</p><p>Despite the lack of a trial, Gert van Rooyen's crimes have remained in the public consciousness in South Africa, and have been the subject of numerous media investigations and criminal profiles. In recent years, a new wave of interest in the case has emerged with the release of the Netflix documentary series "The Keepers," which examines the unsolved murder of a Baltimore nun and the potential involvement of a local priest. The documentary draws parallels to van Rooyen's case, and has sparked renewed discussion of the crimes and their impact on South African society. Today, Gert van Rooyen is remembered as a monster by those who knew his victims and those who followed the case, serving as a stark reminder of the dangers of trusting strangers and the need for vigilance in the face of evil.</p><p></p><p>
