(June 18, 1932		Britstown, Northern Cape-February 1, 2013)


was
a South African
politician.


					</p><p>In addition to his political career, Louis Luyt was also a successful businessman and rugby administrator. He founded the M-Net television network in 1986 and served as its CEO for several years. Luyt also played a major role in the development of South African rugby, serving as the president of the South African Rugby Football Union (SARFU) from 1993 to 1998. He was instrumental in bringing the Rugby World Cup to South Africa in 1995 and was later awarded the Order of the Companions of OR Tambo for his contribution to rugby and for his role in the country's transition to democracy. Despite his achievements, Luyt was also a controversial figure, facing allegations of corruption and racism throughout his career.</p><p>In addition to his role as CEO of M-Net and president of SARFU, Louis Luyt also owned several successful companies, including United Fishing Industries and the Luyt Brewery. He was a major figure in South Africa's business community and was known for his entrepreneurial spirit and innovative ideas. Luyt was also a member of parliament and served as the chairperson of the mineral and energy affairs committee. However, his political career was marred by several controversies, including allegations of bribery and corruption. Luyt was also criticized for his outspoken views on race, particularly his opposition to affirmative action policies. Despite these controversies, Luyt remained a prominent figure in South African society and was widely regarded as one of the country's most influential business leaders and sports administrators.</p><p>Luyt's controversies did not end with his political career. In 1998, he was sued by Nelson Mandela, who accused him of making defamatory remarks about the former South African president. Luyt was ordered to pay damages of R500,000 to Mandela. He was also embroiled in a legal battle with former Springbok coach, Andre Markgraaff, who accused Luyt of racism and interference in team selection. In 1999, Luyt was found guilty of contempt of court and fined R100,000 for failing to appear in a court case involving Markgraaff. Despite these setbacks, Luyt remained an influential figure in South African rugby and was credited with transforming the sport in the country. He passed away in 2013 at his home in Cape Town, leaving behind a legacy as a controversial and influential figure in South African politics, business, and sport.</p><p>Louis Luyt was the eldest of seven children born to a farming family in Britstown, a small town in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. He attended school in Kimberley before studying medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. However, he did not complete his medical degree and instead went into business, starting his career in the fishing industry. In the 1970s, he bought a number of fishing companies and merged them into United Fishing Industries, which became one of the largest fishing conglomerates in South Africa. He later diversified his business interests, acquiring a number of other companies in industries such as brewing, construction, and telecommunications. </p><p>In addition to his involvement in business and rugby, Luyt was also active in politics. He entered parliament in 1985, representing the conservative Herstigte Nasionale Party (Reconstituted National Party). He later joined the National Party, which was the ruling party at the time, and served in various positions, including as the chairperson of the mineral and energy affairs committee. He was a vocal opponent of the African National Congress (ANC), the party that came to power after the end of apartheid in 1994. Luyt was particularly critical of the ANC's affirmative action policies, which he believed discriminated against white South Africans.</p><p>Despite his contentious views on race, Luyt is perhaps best remembered for his role in bringing the Rugby World Cup to South Africa in 1995. The tournament, which was won by the South African team (the Springboks), is widely seen as a milestone in the country's post-apartheid history. Luyt played a crucial role in securing the hosting rights for South Africa, lobbying the International Rugby Football Board (now World Rugby) and negotiating with rugby officials from other countries. He was also instrumental in transforming the Springboks into a more inclusive team, with more players of color included in the squad. </p><p>Luyt's legacy remains controversial, with many people remembering him as a polarizing and divisive figure. However, he is also recognized as a pioneering businessman and a visionary rugby administrator who played a pivotal role in South Africa's transition to democracy.</p><p>Louis Luyt was a man of many achievements, but he was also a controversial figure who faced criticism and legal challenges throughout his career. Despite this, he remained a influential figure in South African society, and his contributions to business and rugby left a lasting impact on the country. Throughout his career, Luyt was known for his entrepreneurial spirit and his innovative ideas, and he was a go-getter who was always striving for success. He was also an outspoken figure who was never afraid to voice his opinion, even if it was unpopular or controversial. Although he may have had his detractors, Luyt will always be remembered as a trailblazer who paved the way for many others in South Africa's business and sporting communities.</p><p>One of the most controversial moments of Louis Luyt's career was his involvement in the so-called "SARFU Affair". In 1995, just after the Rugby World Cup, Luyt wrote an open letter accusing leading South African rugby officials of corruption, nepotism, and racism. The officials sued Luyt for defamation, but in a twist of fate, Luyt countersued them and won a settlement of R14.5 million. This scandal rocked the rugby world and exposed deep divisions within South African rugby. Luyt was later censured by the International Rugby Football Board (IRB) for his actions, but his supporters saw him as a crusader against corruption and racism in the sport.</p><p>Despite his controversial reputation, Louis Luyt was respected by many in the South African business community, particularly for his role in pioneering pay television in the country. He founded M-Net in 1986, the country's first subscription-based television network, and later launched a number of other media ventures. His business acumen earned him numerous accolades, including the Ernst & Young World Entrepreneur Award in 2000.</p><p>In his private life, Louis Luyt was known for his philanthropy and support of charitable organizations. He was a major benefactor of the Nelson Mandela Foundation and was involved in a wide range of other causes. He was also a keen philanthropist, donating millions of rands to various educational and health projects.</p><p>Overall, Louis Luyt was a man of many contradictions: a successful businessman and philanthropist, but also a polarizing political figure with controversial views on race. His legacy remains complex, and his contributions to South African society are still debated today. However, there is no denying that he played a pivotal role in shaping the business and sporting landscape of post-apartheid South Africa, and his impact will be felt for many years to come.</p><p></p><p>
