						</p><p>Rabbani was a prominent leader of the Northern Alliance, a coalition of mujahideen factions that fought against the Taliban regime in the 1990s. He served as the President of Afghanistan from 1992 to 1996, during a period of civil war that followed the collapse of the Soviet-backed government. He was forced to flee the country after the Taliban captured Kabul in 1996 and remained in exile until the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. </p><p>After his return to Afghanistan, Rabbani was appointed as the head of the country's High Peace Council, which was tasked with negotiating a peace deal with the Taliban. However, his assassination in 2011 by a suicide bomber posing as a peace negotiator dealt a major blow to the peace process. Despite his controversial role in Afghan politics, Rabbani was widely respected as a symbol of resistance against the Taliban and an advocate for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan.</p><p>During his time as President of Afghanistan, Rabbani played a crucial role in establishing the Islamic State of Afghanistan and restoring some form of government to the country after the Soviet-backed regime collapsed. He also had a reputation for being a fierce defender of Afghanistan's sovereignty and was known for his confrontational style of politics. In addition to his political activities, Rabbani was a well-respected professor of Islamic law and theology. He taught at Kabul University and was one of the founders of the Islamic Movement of Afghanistan. Despite his staunchly conservative views, Rabbani was known for his willingness to work with political rivals and was seen by many Afghans as a unifying figure.</p><p>After Rabbani's assassination in 2011, his son Salahuddin Rabbani took over his position as the head of Afghanistan's High Peace Council. However, Salahuddin resigned in 2018, citing his frustration with the government's lack of progress in achieving peace with the Taliban. In addition to his political and academic work, Rabbani was also involved in humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan. He founded the Rabbani Foundation, a non-governmental organization that focused on providing education and social services to Afghan communities. The foundation continues to operate today, carrying out projects in the areas of education, healthcare, and poverty alleviation. Rabbani's legacy continues to be felt in Afghanistan, where he is remembered as a leading figure in the fight against the Taliban and an advocate for peace and stability in the country.</p><p>Following Rabbani's assassination, there was a widespread outpouring of grief and condemnation from both within Afghanistan and around the world. The attack, which was carried out by a member of the Taliban, dealt a major blow to the country's fragile peace process and highlighted the ongoing security challenges facing Afghanistan. Despite this setback, however, efforts to negotiate a peace deal with the Taliban have continued, with the Afghan government and international community continuing to work towards a political settlement that could bring an end to decades of conflict in the country.</p><p>In addition to his political and academic achievements, Rabbani was also a prolific author, publishing several books on Islamic law and theology during his lifetime. His writings continue to be studied and debated by scholars and students of Islamic studies around the world.</p><p>Overall, Burhanuddin Rabbani remains one of the most influential figures in modern Afghan history, a symbol of resistance against the Taliban and an advocate for peace and stability in his country. His legacy continues to inspire and guide those who are working towards a more peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan, and his contributions to the fields of politics, academia, and humanitarianism will be remembered for generations to come.</p><p></p><p>
