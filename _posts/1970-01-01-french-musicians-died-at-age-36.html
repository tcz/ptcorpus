His criticisms of the monarchy and his advocacy for a republican form of government earned him both praise and condemnation from his contemporaries. Despite his expulsion from the Chamber of Deputies, Carrel continued to use his voice and his newspaper to advocate for his beliefs. </p><p>In addition to his political and journalistic pursuits, Carrel was also a respected scholar and historian. He was particularly interested in the history of medieval France and wrote several books on the subject, including "Histoire de Charles VII" and "Histoire de Saint Louis." His historical writings were well-received by both academics and the general public, and cemented his reputation as an intellectual and a public figure.</p><p>Carrel's untimely death at the age of 36, as a result of a duel, was a shock to the French political and journalistic communities.

He was particularly admired by Italian nationalists, such as Giuseppe Mazzini, who saw him as a model of courage and commitment to the cause of independence and democracy.

		a.k.a. Henri Toulouse-Lautrec or Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa

	
was
a French
artist, painter and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is famous for his innovative and distinctive works in the field of Post-Impressionism and is widely regarded as one of the foremost artists of his time. Henri suffered from genetic health conditions due to inbreeding in his family, which left him with fragile health and small stature. Despite this, he had a remarkable artistic career, with a large body of works featuring colorful and often provocative subject matter, including the Parisian nightlife, cabarets, brothels, and the circus. His unique style of art continues to inspire and influence artists to this day. In addition to his widely acclaimed artwork, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was also known for his eccentric personality and love of the bohemian lifestyle.</p><p>He belonged to a wealthy and aristocratic family and was raised by his mother and grandmother after his father's death. Henri showed an early interest in art and enrolled in the School of Fine Arts in Paris when he was just 18 years old. However, he was forced to leave due to health issues and later became a student of the famous painter Leon Bonnat. Henri had a close relationship with his father's cousin, Gabriel Tapié de Celigny, who became his mentor and introduced him to the Parisian art scene. Henri's works became more popular after he participated in several exhibitions, and he gained recognition for his use of color, exceptional draftsmanship, and unique representation of the Parisian lifestyle. Despite his success, Henri's health continued to deteriorate, and he died at the young age of 36 due to complications from alcoholism and syphilis. Today, his artwork is on display in museums around the world, and his legacy continues to influence modern art.</p><p>Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was known for his ability to capture the essence of society's outsiders in his art, particularly those who frequented the cabarets and brothels of Paris. His subjects were often the people on the margins of society, such as prostitutes and dancers, and he depicted them with great empathy and sensitivity, breaking from the traditional norms of beauty and decorum in art. Henri also experimented with new techniques and forms of media, such as lithography and poster-making, which allowed his art to reach a broader audience.</p><p>Aside from his artwork, Henri was also known for his love of horses and equestrianism, which he explored in his art as well. He was a frequent visitor to the famous Moulin Rouge cabaret, where he was a regular patron and sometimes even participated in the shows.

(March 16, 1908		Boulzicourt-May 21, 1944			Paris)

	
		also known as Rene Daumal

	
was
a French
writer, novelist and poet.


					</p><p>Daumal was associated with the Surrealist movement and was particularly influenced by the teachings of Gurdjieff. He founded a literary magazine called Le Grand Jeu (The Great Game) along with his friends Roger Gilbert-Lecomte and Roger Vailland, which published works that were often experimental and surreal. Daumal's most famous work is the novel "Mount Analogue," which is a philosophical allegory about a group of adventurers who embark on a journey to find an imaginary mountain that is said to exist beyond the boundaries of time and space. His work has been described as mystical and metaphysical, and continues to be popular among readers interested in avant-garde literature.</p><p>Daumal was born into a middle-class family and spent his childhood in a small village in France. He developed an early interest in literature and was an avid reader from a young age. At the age of 18, he moved to Paris to pursue his studies in philosophy and literature. It was during this time that he became involved with the Surrealist movement and met his future collaborators, Gilbert-Lecomte and Vailland.</p><p>Daumal's fascination with Gurdjieff's teachings led him to become a member of the Gurdjieff group in Paris. This had a profound influence on his writing and his philosophy, which emphasized the importance of self-awareness and the search for inner meaning. His novel "Mount Analogue" can be seen as a reflection of these ideas, as it explores the themes of spiritual enlightenment and the quest for transcendence.</p><p>Throughout his short life, Daumal struggled with health problems, including tuberculosis, which eventually led to his untimely death at the age of 36. Despite his relatively brief career, his work has had a lasting impact on the world of literature, and he is remembered as one of the most talented and innovative writers of his time.</p><p>Daumal's literary contribution also included translations of several works, including a translation of P.D. Ouspensky's "A New Model of the Universe" into French. In addition to his writings, Daumal was also a talented artist and musician, playing the piano and guitar. He was known for his eccentricity and his unconventional lifestyle, often living in poverty and spending his days writing and exploring spiritual practices. </p><p>Despite his struggles with health and financial instability, Daumal continued to produce influential works throughout his life, with "Mount Analogue" being considered a landmark of 20th-century literature. His legacy has continued to influence artists and thinkers across generations and his experimental and visionary approach to literature continues to inspire readers today.</p><p></p><p>

(October 10, 1684		Valenciennes-July 18, 1721			Nogent-sur-Marne)

	
		a.k.a. Antoine Watteau

	
was
a French
artist, painter and visual artist.


					</p><p>Watteau was best known for his paintings of scenes from the theater and from fashionable life, which were characterized by delicate brushwork, vibrant color, and a lighthearted mood. His work influenced the Rococo style that emerged in the early 18th century and was particularly popular in France and Germany. Despite his short career, Watteau had a profound impact on the development of French art and culture, and his work continues to be celebrated as some of the finest examples of the Rococo style. In addition to his artistic achievements, he was also an accomplished draftsman and printmaker, and his work in these media further contributed to his renown in his lifetime and beyond.</p><p>Watteau began his artistic training as an apprentice to a local painter in his hometown of Valenciennes, but later moved to Paris to study under the painter Claude Gillot. He earned a living as a decorator of harpsichords and theater sets before gaining recognition as a painter in his own right.</p><p>One of Watteau's most famous works is the painting "Pilgrimage to Cythera," which depicts a group of elegantly dressed couples on a fictional island of love. The painting is notable for its delicate brushwork and subtle use of color, as well as its evocative and dreamlike atmosphere.</p><p>Watteau's art enjoyed great popularity during his lifetime, with many collectors and patrons eager to acquire his work. Today, his paintings are highly prized by museums and collectors around the world, and his influence on art history remains significant.</p><p>Watteau's art was unique in that it combined elements of fantasy and reality, featuring characters from the commedia dell'arte in idyllic landscapes and settings. This distinctive style earned him the nickname "painter of the fêtes galantes," as his works often portrayed elegant and relaxed scenes from upper-class society.</p><p>Watteau's impact on the art world extended beyond his own lifetime, and his influence can be seen in the works of later artists such as Fragonard and Boucher. He also inspired a generation of writers and poets, who were fascinated by his vision of the world and his ability to capture the essence of human emotion through his paintings.</p><p>In addition to his paintings, Watteau also produced a number of drawings and sketches, which are highly valued for their skillful use of line and for their ability to capture the essence of movement and emotion. Many of these drawings were later used as studies for his larger paintings, and they provide a fascinating insight into the creative process of one of the most celebrated artists of the 18th century.</p><p>Overall, Jean-Antoine Watteau remains one of the most important and influential artists of the Rococo period, and his legacy continues to inspire artists and art enthusiasts around the world more than three centuries after his death.</p><p></p><p>

(November 1, 1848		Damvillers-December 10, 1884			Paris)


was
a French
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>Bastien-Lepage was known for his naturalistic approach to painting, which was characterized by his use of plein air painting techniques and attention to detail. He was particularly interested in depicting scenes from rural life, and his work often portrayed peasants and laborers engaged in everyday activities. Despite his relatively short career, Bastien-Lepage was an influential figure in the development of French naturalism, and his work had a lasting impact on the development of modern art. Some of his most famous works include "Haymaking," "The Potato Gatherers," and "Joan of Arc."</p><p>Bastien-Lepage was born into a family of artists, and he demonstrated a natural talent for drawing and painting from a young age. He studied art in Paris at the École des Beaux-Arts and later at the atelier of Alexandre Cabanel. His breakthrough work, "The Hayfield," was shown at the Salon in 1878 and became a critical and commercial success. The painting's naturalistic style and attention to detail were a marked departure from the more idealized and romanticized depictions of rural life that were popular at the time.</p><p>In addition to his naturalistic paintings, Bastien-Lepage was also a skilled portraitist and did portraits of many notable figures of his time, including the composer Ambroise Thomas and the poet Anatole France. He was a member of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and was also awarded the Légion d'honneur in 1880.</p><p>Sadly, Bastien-Lepage's career was cut short by his untimely death at the age of 36 from cancer. Despite his short career, his work had a significant impact on the development of modern art, particularly in the naturalism and plein air painting movements. Today, his paintings are housed in major museums and collections around the world, including the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p><p>Bastien-Lepage's work also had an impact beyond the art world. His depiction of rural life and the working class was seen as a political statement, as it challenged the idealized and romanticized images of the French countryside that were prevalent at the time. Bastien-Lepage's work was seen as a celebration of the common people, and his focus on their everyday lives was seen as a commentary on the social issues of the time. </p><p>Bastien-Lepage's influence can be seen in the work of many later artists, including Vincent van Gogh and Édouard Manet. Van Gogh admired Bastien-Lepage's naturalistic approach to painting and began to experiment with similar techniques in his own work. Manet was also influenced by Bastien-Lepage's focus on everyday life and his use of natural light. </p><p>Today, Bastien-Lepage is remembered as one of the key figures in the development of modern art, particularly in France. His naturalistic approach to painting and his focus on the lives of ordinary people helped to challenge the traditional ideals of beauty and subject matter in art.</p><p></p><p>
