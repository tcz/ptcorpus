							Baraka was a leading figure in the Black Arts Movement, a cultural and political movement that advocated for the independence and self-expression of black artists and writers. He was a prolific writer, producing poetry, essays, fiction, and plays that dealt with race, politics, sex, and spirituality. Some of his most famous works include the plays "Dutchman" and "The Slave," and the books "Blues People: Negro Music in White America" and "Black Magic: Collected Poetry 1961-1967."</p><p>Baraka's political views evolved throughout his life. He was initially a supporter of the integrationist civil rights movement, but became increasingly radicalized in the 1960s and embraced black nationalism and Marxism. In the 1970s, he helped found the Congress of African People, a socialist organization that advocated for black self-determination.</p><p>Baraka was also a controversial figure, often courting controversy with his outspoken views on race and politics. In 1965, he was arrested and beaten by police during the Watts riots in Los Angeles. In the 1980s, he was criticized for his anti-Semitic comments, which led to his removal from the poetry faculty at Rutgers University. Despite his detractors, Baraka remained a powerful and influential voice in American literature and politics until his death in 2014.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=8568334" title="Wikipedia article about Amiri Baraka">Amiri Baraka on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/australian-actresses-died-at-age-69.html' title='Australian actresses died at age 69'><strong>Australian actresses died at age 69</strong> List of the top 1 Australian actresses who died when they were 69</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actresses-died-in-arthritis.html' title='Famous actresses died in Arthritis'><strong>Famous actresses died in Arthritis</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actresses who died in Arthritis</a></li><li><a href='/greek-musicians-died-at-age-62.html' title='Greek musicians died at age 62'><strong>Greek musicians died at age 62</strong> List of the top 6 Greek music stars who died when they were 62</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/mexican-actors-died-at-age-76.html' title='Mexican actors died at age 76'><strong>Mexican actors died at age 76</strong> List of the top 4 Mexican actors who died when they were 76</a></li><li><a href='/egyptian-musicians-died-in-emphysema.html' title='Egyptian musicians died in Emphysema'><strong>Egyptian musicians died in Emphysema</strong> List of the top 1 Egyptian music stars who died in Emphysema</a></li><li><a href='/american-actors-born-in-1965.html' title='American actors born in 1965'><strong>American actors born in 1965</strong> List of the top 50 American actors who were born in 1965</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
