was
a Polish
writer, poet and playwright.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Maria Mickiewicz, Helena Mickiewicz, Władysław Mickiewicz, Aleksander Mickiewicz, Jan Mickiewicz and Józef Mickiewicz.

						</p><p>Considered to be one of the greatest masters of Polish Romanticism, Mickiewicz is best known for his literary works. His most notable poems include "Pan Tadeusz", a narrative poem about the life and customs of the Polish gentry in 1811-12, and "Dziady", a poetic drama about the struggles of the Polish people against foreign oppression. Additionally, he wrote several plays, including "Ballady i romanse", "Drama" and "Konrad Wallenrod". </p><p>Mickiewicz was a prominent figure in the Polish independence movement during the 19th century, and his writings often reflected his nationalist and patriotic views. In 1832, he was exiled from Russia, where he had been working as a university professor, for his involvement in anti-government activities. He spent the rest of his life traveling throughout Europe and writing, eventually settling in Istanbul in 1855, where he passed away from cholera.</p><p>Mickiewicz's legacy has had a lasting impact on Polish literature and culture. His works continue to be celebrated and studied to this day, and he is regarded as a national hero in Poland.</p><p>Mickiewicz was born in what is now Belarus, which at the time was part of the Russian Empire. He was raised in a noble family and received a classical education. In 1815, he began studying at the University of Vilnius, where he became involved in a secret student organization called the Philomaths, which advocated for Polish independence.</p><p>After graduating, Mickiewicz became a tutor for a wealthy landowner's family, but he continued to write poetry and plays. In 1823, he published his first collection of poems, "Ballady i romanse," which was well-received by critics and readers alike.</p><p>Mickiewicz's involvement in the Polish independence movement led to his exile from Russia in 1832. He spent the next several years traveling throughout Europe, including stays in Italy, Switzerland, and France. During this time, he continued to write and published several more works, including "Konrad Wallenrod" and "Pan Tadeusz."</p><p>In 1840, Mickiewicz moved to Paris, where he became involved with other Polish exiles and continued to write and publish. He also became a French citizen in 1848.</p><p>Mickiewicz's final years were overshadowed by personal tragedy. His wife and several of his children died, and he struggled with alcoholism and depression. He traveled to Istanbul in 1855, hoping the change of scenery would improve his health, but he died there later that year from cholera.</p><p>Despite his difficult life, Mickiewicz is considered a cultural icon in Poland and remains one of the most celebrated poets in Polish literature. His works have been translated into many languages and continue to inspire readers around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(January 21, 1822		Gliwice-December 18, 1878)


was
a Polish
scientist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work as a naturalist and explorer in Australia during the mid-19th century. Blandowski studied zoology and botany in Europe before emigrating to Australia in 1849. There, he worked as a taxidermist and naturalist for various institutions, including the Melbourne Zoo and the National Museum of Victoria. </p><p>In 1856, Blandowski led an expedition to study the natural history and indigenous cultures of the Murray-Darling river system in Australia. This expedition resulted in the publication of Blandowski's major work, "Australien in 142 Photographischen Abbildungen," a multi-volume study of Australian flora, fauna, and culture. </p><p>Blandowski also played a crucial role in documenting the cultural practices of the indigenous peoples he encountered during his expeditions, notably the Wergaia and Jardwadjali tribes of western Victoria. His detailed illustrations of indigenous ceremonies, tools, and food sources remain some of the most significant records of Australian Aboriginal culture. </p><p>Despite his valuable contributions to Australian science and culture, Blandowski's legacy was largely overlooked in his time. However, in recent years, renewed interest in his work has led to a re-evaluation of his contributions to the fields of natural history and anthropology.</p><p>In addition to his work as a naturalist and explorer, Blandowski was also a skilled artist and photographer. He produced many detailed sketches and paintings of Australian flora, fauna, and landscapes during his expeditions, which were used as the basis for the illustrations in his publications. Blandowski was also one of the earliest photographers in Australia, and he used his camera to document the people and places he encountered on his travels. His photographs, which are considered some of the earliest examples of Australian documentary photography, provide a valuable glimpse into life in mid-19th century Australia. Despite facing significant challenges during his expeditions, including harsh environmental conditions and a lack of funding, Blandowski persevered in his pursuit of scientific knowledge and his efforts to document the natural history and indigenous cultures of Australia. Today, he is recognized as a pioneer in the fields of Australian natural history and anthropology, and his legacy continues to inspire scientists and artists alike.</p><p></p><p>
