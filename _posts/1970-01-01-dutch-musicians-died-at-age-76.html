(February 27, 1897		Groningen-October 25, 1973			Wassenaar)


was
a Dutch
graphic designer and industrial designer.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the pioneers of constructivist design and is known for his contributions to the De Stijl art movement. Schuitema worked as an advertising consultant for companies such as PTT, Philips and KLM and was responsible for the graphic design of many of their promotional materials. In addition to his work in graphic design, Schuitema was a passionate advocate for functional design and the idea that design should be used for social betterment. He mentored many up-and-coming designers and taught at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. Schuitema's legacy continues to influence modern design, particularly in the field of typography.</p><p>Schuitema's interest in functional design led him to explore and experiment with typography. He favored sans-serif typefaces because they were easier to read and allowed for better legibility. He also believed that typography should be used to support and enhance communication rather than just being a decorative element. Schuitema's most famous work is probably the poster he designed for the Nederlandsche Kabelfabriek in 1930. The design features a bold, geometric composition with the company's name displayed in large, sans-serif letters. The poster was praised for its innovative use of typography and is still celebrated as a landmark in Dutch graphic design. In addition to his design work, Schuitema was also a writer and contributor to several design publications. He expressed his beliefs about design and its role in society in many of his articles and essays.</p><p>Schuitema's interest in the De Stijl movement led him to develop a strong sense of geometric abstraction, which he incorporated into his designs. This style was characterized by its simplicity and boldness, and it reflected his belief in the power of visual communication to convey information and influence behavior.</p><p>Schuitema's work also reflected a deep commitment to social responsibility, and he worked to promote the use of design in service of the public good. His advocacy for functional design, which he saw as a means of promoting efficiency and clarity, was reflected in his work for the Dutch government and in his promotion of the use of standardized forms and symbols.</p><p>Schuitema's influence extended beyond his work as a designer and educator, and he was active in a number of social and political movements. He was a member of the Dutch Resistance during World War II, and he worked to promote the rights of workers and promote environmentalism in postwar Europe.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Schuitema remained modest and focused on the work at hand, and he continued to experiment with new styles and techniques throughout his career. His innovative approach to typography and his commitment to social responsibility continue to inspire designers today.</p><p></p><p>
