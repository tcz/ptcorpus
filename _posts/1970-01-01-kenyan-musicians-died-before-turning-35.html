(April 4, 1979		Mombasa-September 15, 2009			Barawa)


was
a Kenyan
personality.


					</p><p>He was a high-ranking member of Al-Shabaab, an Islamic extremist group fighting in Somalia. Nabhan was wanted by the United States for his involvement in the 2002 Mombasa attacks, in which a hotel was bombed and a plane was shot down, killing 15 people. He was also linked to several other terrorist attacks in the region. In 2009, he was killed in a US Special Forces raid in Barawa, Somalia. Nabhan's death was seen as a significant blow to Al-Shabaab's leadership and operations in East Africa.</p><p>Nabhan was born in Mombasa, Kenya to a Muslim family. He grew up in a coastal town known for its large Muslim population, and attended local schools before becoming involved in Islamic extremist groups in his teenage years. In the years leading up to his death, Nabhan had become a key figure in Al-Shabaab, an extremist group with links to Al-Qaeda.</p><p>In addition to his involvement in the 2002 Mombasa attacks, Nabhan was also believed to have been involved in the 2008 attack on the American embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. He was known for his expertise in bomb-making and was considered a dangerous and influential member of Al-Shabaab.</p><p>Nabhan's death came as a result of a US Special Forces raid in Barawa, Somalia, in which he was one of several high-ranking Al-Shabaab members targeted. The raid was part of a broader effort by the US and its allies to disrupt and dismantle Al-Shabaab's operations in East Africa.</p><p>In the aftermath of Nabhan's death, there was widespread speculation about the impact it would have on Al-Shabaab's operations. While some analysts suggested that the group would be weakened by the loss of such a key figure, others argued that Al-Shabaab was resilient and would continue to pose a threat in the region.</p><p></p><p>
