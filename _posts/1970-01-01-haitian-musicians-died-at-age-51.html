was
a Haitian
personality.


					</p><p>Clairvius Narcisse was a Haitian personality who claimed to have been turned into a zombie by a voodoo practitioner. He was reported to have died in 1962 and was buried, but he later reappeared in 1980, having been turned into a zombie by a mixture of drugs that included tetrodotoxin from pufferfish. Narcisse claimed that he had been forced to work on a sugarcane plantation and had been kept under the influence of drugs by the voodoo practitioner. His story attracted international attention and sparked debates about the existence of zombies in Haitian folklore. In later years, Narcisse became an advocate for the rights of Haitian migrant workers in the United States.</p><p>After his return from zombification, Narcisse spent some time in a psychiatric hospital in the United States where he was treated for severe depressive disorder. He later moved to New York City where he worked as a dishwasher, but he struggled to adapt to life outside of Haiti. Despite his difficulties, Narcisse became increasingly vocal about the exploitative conditions that Haitian migrant workers faced in the United States. He drew attention to the systemic racism and discrimination that they faced, and he advocated for their rights at rallies and events throughout the country. In addition to his work as an activist, Narcisse also continued to share his zombie story with researchers and journalists, contributing to a greater understanding of Haitian folklore and the cultural significance of zombies in Haitian society. He died of natural causes in 1994.</p><p></p><p>

(October 9, 1900		Haiti-July 22, 1952			Port-au-Prince)


was
a Haitian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a track and field athlete who competed in the long jump and triple jump events. Cator represented Haiti in the 1924 Summer Olympics held in Paris, where he won a silver medal in the long jump event. He also set a world record in triple jump for an athlete from a tropical nation during the 1928 Olympics held in Amsterdam. Outside of his athletic pursuits, Cator also worked as a lawyer and was active in Haitian politics. He served as a member of parliament and held various government positions throughout his career. Despite his success in both sports and politics, Cator faced criticism and controversy due to his lighter skin color and perceived allegiance to the country's elite ruling class.</p><p>Cator's success in track and field inspired him to organize athletic events throughout Haiti, promoting sports and encouraging young people to participate. He also founded a sports club in Port-au-Prince that trained athletes in various disciplines. Cator's legacy in Haitian sports was recognized in 1956, when the country's main stadium, Stade National Sylvio Cator, was named in his honor. The stadium has since hosted many international sporting events, including the 1974 Central American and Caribbean Games and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The legacy of Sylvio Cator also lives on in the form of an annual soccer tournament, known as the Tournament of Sylvio Cator, which is held in the neighborhood where he grew up. His contributions to the development of sports in Haiti and his accomplishments on the track and in politics have made him an iconic figure in Haitian history.</p><p></p><p>
