						Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was a renowned American singer and songwriter whose meteoric rise to fame came to a tragic and untimely end. Born in Lake Jackson, Texas, Selena began singing from a young age, and by the time she was a teenager, she had already fronted a band with her siblings. As a Tejano singer, Selena's music was an innovative mix of traditional Latin and contemporary pop, which appealed to both Spanish and English-speaking audiences. Her album, Amor Prohibido, remains one of the best-selling Latin albums of all time, and her style and sound made her an icon of Latino culture. Her life was cut short when she was murdered by the president of her fan club, Yolanda Saldívar, in 1995, at the age of 23. However, her legacy lives on, and Selena continues to inspire generations of musicians and fans with her music, style, and grace.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=69795" title="Wikipedia article about Selena">Selena on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/turkish-musicians-died-in-murder.html' title='Turkish musicians died in Murder'><strong>Turkish musicians died in Murder</strong> List of the top 2 Turkish music stars who died in Murder</a></li><li><a href='/british-actresses-died-in-suicide.html' title='British actresses died in Suicide'><strong>British actresses died in Suicide</strong> List of the top 9 British actresses who died in Suicide</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-actresses-died-in-dementia.html' title='Canadian actresses died in Dementia'><strong>Canadian actresses died in Dementia</strong> List of the top 1 Canadian actresses who died in Dementia</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/belgian-musicians-died-at-age-58.html' title='Belgian musicians died at age 58'><strong>Belgian musicians died at age 58</strong> List of the top 12 Belgian music stars who died when they were 58</a></li><li><a href='/irish-musicians-died-at-age-57.html' title='Irish musicians died at age 57'><strong>Irish musicians died at age 57</strong> List of the top 5 Irish music stars who died when they were 57</a></li><li><a href='/cambodian-actresses-died-in-gunshot.html' title='Cambodian actresses died in Gunshot'><strong>Cambodian actresses died in Gunshot</strong> List of the top 1 Cambodian actresses who died in Gunshot</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
