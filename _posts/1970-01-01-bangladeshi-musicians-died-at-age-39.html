(March 22, 1894		Chittagong-January 12, 1934			Chittagong)

	
		also known as Surjya Sen

	
was
a Bangladeshi
personality.


					</p><p>Surya Sen was an influential Bengali revolutionary who played a significant role in India's struggle for independence against British rule. He was a master strategist and led a group of young revolutionaries known as the Chittagong group who carried out an armed revolutionary movement to overthrow the British government.</p><p>Under his leadership, the Chittagong Armory Raid of 1930 was one of the most daring and successful attempts to strike a blow against British rule. As they were outnumbered and outgunned, he and his fellow revolutionaries had to resort to guerrilla war tactics to gain control over the city. However, after a few days of fighting, they were forced to retreat to the hills.</p><p>Surya Sen and his people fled to hideout and continue their fight for independence for several months before he was eventually captured and executed by the British authorities in 1934. His bold actions inspired a generation of people to join the freedom struggle and gain independence from British rule.</p><p>Surya Sen was born in a small village in Chittagong, which is now a part of Bangladesh. He studied at various institutions in Kolkata and was influenced by the revolutionary ideas of figures like Subhash Chandra Bose and Aurobindo Ghosh. After completing his education, Surya Sen started working as a teacher in a school in Chittagong. He organized secret meetings with like-minded people to discuss revolutionary ideas and plan an armed revolt against the British rule.</p><p>In the early 1920s, Surya Sen became a member of the Indian Republican Army (IRA), an organization committed to overthrowing the British rule. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a prominent leader of the revolutionary movement. Along with his colleagues, he started organizing attacks and raids on symbols of British power, such as police stations and government buildings.</p><p>The Chittagong Armory Raid, however, was the most notable incident that Surya Sen led. On April 18, 1930, Surya Sen and his revolutionary group attacked the Chittagong armory in an attempt to seize weapons and ammunition. Although the raid was eventually unsuccessful and many of the revolutionaries were killed or captured, the incident became a turning point in India's freedom struggle. It inspired more people to join the movement and fight for independence from the British.</p><p>Surya Sen's legacy lives on in Bangladesh, where he is considered a national hero. The Chittagong armory has been converted into a museum dedicated to his life and revolutionary activities. Additionally, several books and movies have been made about his life, and he is widely remembered and celebrated for his bravery and leadership in the fight for independence.</p><p>Surya Sen was not just a revolutionary leader, but also a man of many talents. He was an excellent athlete and had represented his school and college in various sports competitions. He was also a brilliant actor and had participated in many plays during his college days. He was deeply influenced by the ideas of socialism and communism and had a strong commitment towards social justice and equality.</p><p>Moreover, Surya Sen had a great sense of responsibility towards his fellow revolutionaries. He had trained them in guerrilla war tactics, and also provided them with medical aid and food during their hideouts in the hills. He had also set up a secret communication network to ensure that his fellow revolutionaries could communicate with each other without being detected by the British authorities.</p><p>Surya Sen's contribution to the Indian freedom struggle has been widely recognized by various political and social organizations. His birth anniversary is celebrated as 'Deshprem Divas' (Patriotism Day) in many parts of Bangladesh. The Indian government has also recognized his contribution by issuing a postage stamp in his honor. Today, Surya Sen's legacy continues to inspire many young people to work towards a better future for their country.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of hanging.

was
a Bangladeshi
politician.


					</p><p>He was one of the key leaders of the Bangladesh Liberation War and a member of the central committee of East Pakistan Jamaat-e-Islami. Qamaruzzaman played a critical role in organizing the Jamaat-e-Islami's notorious paramilitary force, Al-Badr, which committed numerous war crimes during the war. He was also accused of personally overseeing the abduction and killing of numerous pro-independence intellectuals in 1971, and was later sentenced to death by the International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh in 2014 for war crimes and crimes against humanity. His execution was carried out in 2015, after being denied clemency by the President of Bangladesh. His controversial legacy remains a subject of debate in Bangladesh.</p><p>Born on April 5, 1952, in Rajshahi, East Pakistan, Abul Hasnat Muhammad Qamaruzzaman completed his education at Rajshahi University before joining Jamaat-e-Islami in 1969. During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, he became a key leader in the party's armed wing, Al-Badr, organizing and leading several operations against the pro-independence forces. Following Bangladesh's independence, Qamaruzzaman went into hiding but eventually surfaced and resumed his political activities as a leader of Jamaat-e-Islami's youth wing.</p><p>After Jamaat-e-Islami was banned in 1975, following the assassination of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Qamaruzzaman went into hiding once again. However, he was apprehended in 2012 by the International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh, which was set up to investigate and try those accused of war crimes during the liberation war.</p><p>Qamaruzzaman's trial and subsequent conviction sparked controversy in Bangladesh, with some lauding his execution as justice finally being served for the victims of war crimes committed by Al-Badr, while others criticized it as a political move by the government to undermine its opposition. Nevertheless, Qamaruzzaman's legacy remains a contentious and divisive issue in the country's politics and history.</p><p>Qamaruzzaman's family members, including his wife and children, maintained his innocence, arguing that he was being falsely accused and politically targeted. His trial was also criticized by some human rights organizations, which highlighted concerns about due process and fairness. Despite these criticisms, Qamaruzzaman's conviction and subsequent execution were upheld by Bangladesh's higher courts, and he became the second person to be hanged for war crimes by the International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh. Qamaruzzaman's case continues to be a polarizing issue in Bangladesh, reflecting the deep divisions and unresolved questions surrounding the country's struggle for independence in 1971.</p><p></p><p>
