(October 7, 1900		Munich-May 23, 1945			Lüneburg)

	
		a.k.a. Himmler, Reichsheini or Heinrich Luitpold Himmler

	
was
a German
politician and agronomist.


					
			
		He had
		four
		children,
		Gudrun Burwitz, Nanette Dorothea Potthast, Gerhard von Ahe and Helge Potthast.

						</p><p>Heinrich Himmler is widely regarded as one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany, second only to Adolf Hitler himself. He joined the Nazi party in 1923 and quickly rose through the ranks to become head of the SS, or Schutzstaffel, in 1929. The SS was a powerful paramilitary organization that played a key role in the Nazi regime's atrocities during World War II, including the Holocaust.</p><p>In addition to his role in the SS, Himmler was also responsible for the implementation of the "Final Solution," the Nazi plan to exterminate European Jews. He oversaw the construction and operation of concentration camps and played a key role in the organization of mass deportations of Jews and other groups deemed undesirable by the Nazi regime.</p><p>Despite his many atrocities, Himmler was also known for his interest in occultism and mysticism. He believed in the idea of a "master race" and actively promoted the study of ancient Germanic culture and mythology. In addition to his political and ideological pursuits, Himmler was also a trained agronomist and oversaw several agricultural initiatives intended to support the Nazi regime's war effort.</p><p>Himmler's suicide in 1945 came at the end of the war, as Allied forces closed in on Germany. After the war, he was declared a war criminal and many of his associates in the Nazi regime were tried and convicted for their role in the atrocities committed during the war.</p><p>Himmler's early life was marked by a fascination with German nationalism and anti-Semitism. After completing his secondary education, he studied agriculture and took up a number of different jobs before joining the Nazi party.In addition to his work in the SS, Himmler was also instrumental in the creation of the Gestapo, the secret police force that hunted down and arrested individuals deemed to be enemies of the Nazi regime.</p><p>Himmler's tenure as head of the SS was marked by a ruthless pursuit of power and a willingness to use any means necessary to maintain his position. He oversaw the creation of a vast network of concentration and extermination camps across Europe, and was personally responsible for ordering the deaths of millions of people, including Jews, Romani, homosexuals, and political dissidents.</p><p>Despite his brutal reputation, Himmler was also known for his love of animals and his support of conservation efforts. He fancied himself an amateur ornithologist and was even involved in the creation of a national park in Poland.</p><p>After the war, Himmler's remains were buried in an unmarked grave in an undisclosed location, and his legacy continues to be a subject of intense debate and speculation among historians and scholars.</p><p>Himmler was known for his obsession with physical fitness and health. He believed that the Aryan race should be physically fit and healthy, and promoted the idea of "race hygiene." He established an organization called the "Lebensborn" which encouraged pure-blooded Aryans to have children with each other. Himmler himself was a vegetarian and promoted the use of alternative medicine, such as homeopathy and herbal remedies. </p><p>In addition to his political and military roles, Himmler was also involved in the arts. He was a supporter of the German theater and music, and oversaw the creation of the Ahnenerbe, an organization that researched ancient history and mythology in an effort to prove the superiority of the Aryan race. The Ahnenerbe also sponsored expeditions to the Arctic and Tibet, among other places, in search of evidence to support Nazi ideology.</p><p>Despite his many interests and pursuits, Heinrich Himmler will always be remembered for his role in one of the darkest chapters of human history. His legacy is one of brutality, oppression, and hate, and serves as a warning to future generations about the dangers of extremism and intolerance.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in suicide.
