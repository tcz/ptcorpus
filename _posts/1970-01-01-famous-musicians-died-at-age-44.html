						</p><p>Heinrich Himmler is widely regarded as one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany, second only to Adolf Hitler himself. He joined the Nazi party in 1923 and quickly rose through the ranks to become head of the SS, or Schutzstaffel, in 1929. The SS was a powerful paramilitary organization that played a key role in the Nazi regime's atrocities during World War II, including the Holocaust.</p><p>In addition to his role in the SS, Himmler was also responsible for the implementation of the "Final Solution," the Nazi plan to exterminate European Jews. He oversaw the construction and operation of concentration camps and played a key role in the organization of mass deportations of Jews and other groups deemed undesirable by the Nazi regime.</p><p>Despite his many atrocities, Himmler was also known for his interest in occultism and mysticism. He believed in the idea of a "master race" and actively promoted the study of ancient Germanic culture and mythology. In addition to his political and ideological pursuits, Himmler was also a trained agronomist and oversaw several agricultural initiatives intended to support the Nazi regime's war effort.</p><p>Himmler's suicide in 1945 came at the end of the war, as Allied forces closed in on Germany. After the war, he was declared a war criminal and many of his associates in the Nazi regime were tried and convicted for their role in the atrocities committed during the war.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in suicide.
