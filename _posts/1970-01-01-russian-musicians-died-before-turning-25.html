He is also honored by a number of universities and educational institutions in Russia, including the Nizhny Novgorod State University and the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art.</p><p>Beyond his impact on his brother Vladimir and the Soviet Revolution, Aleksandr Ulyanov is also remembered for his academic achievements. He was particularly interested in the natural sciences and took courses in physics, chemistry, and biology while at St. Petersburg University. He was known for his sharp intellect and his passion for learning. In addition, his execution sparked outrage and protests throughout Russia, and was seen as a significant moment in the country's history.
