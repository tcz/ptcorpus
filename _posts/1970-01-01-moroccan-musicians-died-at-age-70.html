						</p><p>Hassan II ruled Morocco for 38 years, from 1961 until his death in 1999. During his reign, he played a key role in landmark events such as the Green March, which saw Morocco seize the Western Sahara, and the Madrid Conference which dealt with the Arab-Israeli conflict. He also oversaw economic reforms and modernization efforts in the country. However, Hassan II's regime was known for widespread human rights abuses, including torture and forced disappearances of political dissidents. Despite this, he maintained a close relationship with the west, particularly with France and the United States. After his death, he was succeeded by his son, Mohammed VI.</p><p>Hassan II was known for his charisma and strong personality, which allowed him to navigate the often complicated and delicate politics of the region. He was also deeply committed to preserving Morocco's traditional culture and Islamic heritage. In addition to his political career, he was an accomplished poet and writer, with several collections of his work published over the course of his life.</p><p>Hassan II was educated in Morocco and France, and went on to study law and political science at the University of Bordeaux. He ascended to the throne following the death of his father, King Mohammed V, in 1961, and quickly began to implement his vision for modernizing and transforming Morocco.</p><p>Throughout his reign, Hassan II faced numerous challenges, including ongoing conflict with separatist groups in the Western Sahara region and opposition from leftist and Islamist movements within Morocco. His response to these challenges was often brutal, with widespread reports of human rights abuses and repression of political dissent.</p><p>Despite these controversies, Hassan II remained a popular and respected figure among many Moroccans, who saw him as a strong and capable leader. He also maintained close ties with many world leaders, including US President Bill Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac.</p><p>Overall, Hassan II's legacy remains a subject of mixed opinions, with some praising his accomplishments and contributions to Morocco's development, while others criticize his record on human rights and political freedom.</p><p>During his reign, Hassan II also implemented major educational initiatives in Morocco, including the founding of several universities and the introduction of free compulsory education. He also prioritized infrastructure development, leading to the construction of highways, airports, and major public works projects. Additionally, he sought to promote international cooperation, serving as a mediator in several regional conflicts and playing an influential role in the Arab League and the Organization of African Unity.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Hassan II is remembered as a complex and multifaceted figure in Moroccan history. He was a proud defender of Moroccan heritage and traditions, while also advocating for modernization and progress. In his personal life, he was known for his insistence on frugality and simplicity, rejecting the lavish lifestyles typically associated with royal families. Today, his image can be seen throughout Morocco, from portraits in government buildings to statues in public squares, making him a lasting presence in the country's collective memory.</p><p></p><p>
