was
a Croatian

He was appointed as the Prime Minister of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) in 1941 and later became the Poglavnik, or leader, of the NDH. During his tenure, Pavelić's regime committed numerous war crimes and atrocities against Jews, Romas, Serbs, and other non-Croats. It is estimated that his regime killed between 300,000 and 500,000 people, with some sources suggesting even higher numbers. After the war, Pavelić fled to Argentina, where he lived in exile until his death in 1959. Despite his association with extremist and violent political beliefs, Pavelić remains a controversial and divisive figure in Croatian history.</p><p>During Pavelić's time in power, he enforced a policy of forced conversions of Orthodox Serbs to Catholicism with the goal of creating a homogeneous Catholic state. He also established concentration camps, including the notorious Jasenovac camp where an estimated 80,000 people perished, and oversaw the mass killing of Jews and Romas in Croatia.

He was even implicated in a plot to assassinate Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito in 1957. Pavelić died of natural causes in Madrid in 1959 and was buried in a private ceremony. His legacy continues to be a contentious issue in Croatia, with some viewing him as a hero who fought for Croatian independence, while others condemn him as a war criminal and advocate for the prosecution of his remaining followers.</p><p></p><p>
