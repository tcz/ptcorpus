an Austrian
mountaineer.


					</p><p>He became well-known for his daring and audacious climbing expeditions in the Alps during the 1930s. In 1937, he was part of a team that made the first ascent of the Eiger North Face, an achievement that had been considered impossible at the time. Kasparek continued pushing the limits of mountaineering with his climbs in the Dolomites and the Caucasus. However, his life was tragically cut short when he died in a mountaineering accident on Salcantay in the Andes. Despite his short life, Kasparek's impact on the world of mountaineering is still felt today, as he inspired many to pursue their own dreams of conquering the world's most perilous peaks.</p><p>Kasparek's passion for mountaineering began in his teenage years when he started hiking in the Austrian Alps. He honed his skills and gradually evolved into a skilled climber, earning recognition in the mountaineering community for his ability to conquer tough climbs. In the 1930s, Kasparek became a member of the famous "Young Alpinists," a group of talented climbers committed to pushing the boundaries of mountaineering.</p><p>Kasparek's success on the Eiger North Face was a defining moment in his career. The climb is considered one of the most challenging in the world, and many had lost their lives attempting it. Kasparek and his team's success opened the door to new possibilities in the mountaineering world, and they quickly gained international recognition for their remarkable achievement.</p><p>After his success on the Eiger, Kasparek continued to push himself to new heights. He traveled to remote regions of the world, including the Caucasus and South America, in search of new and exciting climbs. Despite the dangers, he remained dedicated to his craft, which ultimately led to his final climb on Salcantay.</p><p>Kasparek is remembered as a pioneer of modern mountaineering and a true inspiration to future generations of climbers. His fearlessness and determination in the face of seemingly impossible challenges continue to inspire people around the world to pursue their dreams and push themselves to new heights.</p><p></p><p>

was
an Austrian
chemist.


					
			
		His child
		is
		called
		Ernst Wertheim.

						</p><p>Wertheim is best known for his contributions in the field of analytical chemistry. He developed a new method of organic analysis called combustion analysis, which involved burning a sample of the substance to be analyzed and measuring the products of combustion to determine its chemical composition. </p><p>In addition to his work in analytical chemistry, Wertheim also made important contributions to the study of phosphorus and its compounds. He discovered several new phosphorus compounds and developed a process for producing phosphorus pentoxide, which is still used in industry today.</p><p>Despite his short life, Wertheim's contributions to chemistry were significant and he is remembered today as one of the pioneering chemists of the 19th century.</p><p>Wertheim was born in Vienna in 1820 and began his studies at the University of Vienna at the age of 16. He earned his PhD in chemistry in 1842 and went on to work as an assistant at the university. In 1847, he became the director of the chemical laboratory at Vienna's Polytechnic Institute. He held this position until his death at the age of 43.</p><p>In addition to his work in chemistry, Wertheim was also interested in politics and social issues. He was a member of the liberal opposition in Austria and was involved in the Austrian revolutions of 1848. He was imprisoned for his political activities in 1850 but was later released.</p><p>Despite his political activities, Wertheim was primarily known for his contributions to chemistry. His combustion analysis method paved the way for modern analytical chemistry and is still used today. He also developed a method for purifying zinc oxide and discovered a new form of sulfur. His work on phosphorus compounds was particularly groundbreaking and he was the first to synthesize a number of new compounds.</p><p>Wertheim's legacy in chemistry was recognized in 1991 when the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) named a new element, 102, after him. The element's official name is Nobelium and it was first synthesized in the 1950s.</p><p></p><p>

(August 16, 1950		Judenburg-June 29, 1994			Graz)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>Jack Unterweger was a writer and journalist, who gained notoriety for committing a string of crimes which included rape and murder. He was convicted of murdering a young girl and had spent 16 years in prison before his release in 1990, during which time he had become a celebrated author and journalist.</p><p>After his release, he was hired by an Austrian magazine to cover stories related to crime and prostitution. However, he resumed his killing spree, targeting prostitutes across Europe, and killing at least 11 women in the span of a year. He was finally caught in Miami, Florida, where he had fled after the police received a tip-off.</p><p>Unterweger's life and crimes have been the subject of numerous books and documentaries. His case has been analyzed by criminologists and psychiatrists as an example of one of the most dangerous types of serial killers - the kind that often target vulnerable members of society, such as sex workers.</p><p>Unterweger's childhood was marked by poverty and abandonment. His mother was a prostitute who was arrested for fraud when Unterweger was just two years old. He was then raised by his grandfather, who was physically abusive towards him. As a teenager, he was sent to prison for committing a series of burglaries.</p><p>While in prison, Unterweger discovered his love for reading and writing. He began writing poetry and short stories, and even managed to publish a book while still serving his sentence. This led to his early release, as many people believed that he had reformed.</p><p>However, Unterweger's release turned out to be a grave mistake. He used his newfound fame as an author and journalist to gain access to vulnerable women, whom he would later rape and murder. He would often strangle his victims with their own bras, a disturbing signature that earned him the nickname "The Bra Strangler".</p><p>Unterweger's case sparked widespread outrage and led to a public debate about the efficacy of the Austrian justice system. It also brought attention to the issue of violence against sex workers, and highlighted the need for better protection and support for this marginalized group.</p><p>Despite his heinous crimes, Unterweger is still remembered by some Austrians as a talented writer and a symbol of social mobility. However, his legacy remains tainted by the suffering he caused to his victims and their families.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of suicide.

He went on to become a member of the SS and rose through the ranks to become the head of the Reich Main Security Office in 1943. Kaltenbrunner was known for his extreme loyalty to Adolf Hitler and his unwavering commitment to the Nazi cause.</p><p>During the war, Kaltenbrunner oversaw the implementation of the Final Solution, which was the plan to exterminate the Jewish people. He was responsible for deporting Jews from Austria to concentration camps, and he also played a role in the extermination of Jews in Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe. Kaltenbrunner was also responsible for the persecution and murder of Roma, homosexuals, and other groups that the Nazis considered "undesirable."</p><p>After the war, Kaltenbrunner was captured by American forces and brought to trial at the Nuremberg trials. He was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and was sentenced to death by hanging. Kaltenbrunner's defense argued that he was only following orders, but the court rejected this defense and held him responsible for his actions. His execution marked the end of his reign of terror and sent a powerful message that Nazi war criminals would be held accountable for their crimes.</p><p></p><p>
