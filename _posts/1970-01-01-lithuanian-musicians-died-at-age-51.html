(February 2, 1896		Lithuania-October 16, 1947			Vilnius)


was
a Lithuanian
playwright, poet and critic.


					</p><p>He was also a professor of literature at Vilnius University before being arrested and sent to a concentration camp during World War II. While in the camp, he wrote a satirical novel titled "The Forest of Gods" which depicted the brutalities of the camp and the inhumanity of the Nazi regime. After surviving the camp, Sruoga returned to Lithuania where he was active in cultural and academic circles until his death in 1947. His work has had a significant impact on Lithuanian literature and he is remembered as a cultural icon and a symbol of resistance against oppression.</p><p>Sruoga, born into a wealthy family, studied in Berlin and received his doctorate from the University of Bonn. He then returned to Lithuania and co-founded a literary journal, Aitvaras, which became an important platform for Lithuanian literature. As a playwright, he is best known for his political satire, including the play "The General from the Jungle", which was banned in pre-World War II Lithuania due to its anti-government themes. In addition to his literary achievements, Sruoga was an avid collector of books, artifacts, and art. His collection, which included medieval manuscripts and rare books, was considered to be one of the finest private collections in the country. Some of his personal belongings, including his eyeglasses, manuscript drafts, and letters, are now on display in the Balys Sruoga Museum in Lithuania.</p><p>Sruoga's legacy extended beyond his literary and cultural contributions. As a professor, he was known for his commitment to education and his influence on his students. He founded the first theatre department in Lithuania and was widely regarded as a visionary in the field. His experiences in the concentration camp also left a lasting impression on him and his work, and he was known to have suffered from physical and psychological trauma as a result. Despite this, he remained politically active and continued to advocate for human rights and social justice throughout his life. His work and advocacy have continued to inspire subsequent generations of Lithuanian writers, artists, and activists. Today, Sruoga is recognized as one of Lithuania's most important cultural figures and his contributions to literature and education are celebrated both at home and abroad.</p><p>In addition to his literary and academic pursuits, Balys Sruoga was also involved in politics. He was a member of the Lithuanian National Democratic Party, which was opposed to the authoritarian government of President Antanas Smetona. Sruoga was particularly critical of the government's efforts to repress artistic and cultural expression, and he used his platform as a writer and professor to advocate for greater freedom of speech and artistic creativity. This activism led to his arrest by the Soviet secret police in 1941, and he was eventually sent to the Stutthof concentration camp in Germany. Despite the harrowing conditions of the camp, Sruoga continued to write and even staged a play with his fellow prisoners. "The Forest of Gods," which was based on his experiences in the camp, was published after his death and has since been translated into over 20 languages. Today, Sruoga's legacy continues to inspire Lithuanians to stand up for their rights and resist oppression.</p><p></p><p>

He grew up in a vibrant cultural environment that stimulated his curiosity and love for knowledge. During his university years, he was actively involved in the Lithuanian dissident movement and participated in the protests against the Soviet regime. His political views influenced his literary work, which often exposed the absurdities and injustices of Soviet society.</p><p>Besides "Vilnius Poker," Gavelis published other significant works, such as "The Last Generation of the Empire," "One Hundred Years of Happiness," and "The Courtyard of the Devil." He received numerous literary awards, including the Lithuanian National Prize for Arts and Culture, and was hailed as one of the most prominent voices of Lithuanian literature of the late 20th century.</p><p>Gavelis was also a passionate defender of human rights and civil liberties, and his writings reflect his commitment to social justice and equality. He was actively involved in the restoration of Lithuanian independence in the early 1990s and played a prominent role in shaping the new political and cultural landscape of the country.</p><p>Today, Gavelis is remembered as a brilliant writer, a fearless journalist, and an uncompromising champion of freedom and democracy. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of writers and intellectuals in Lithuania and beyond.</p><p>During his lifetime, Ricardas Gavelis also worked as a translator, translating works by authors such as Franz Kafka and Samuel Beckett into Lithuanian. His interest in literature and language also led him to co-found the Lithuanian Association of Literary Translators. In addition to his professional and literary pursuits, Gavelis was also an avid traveler, visiting countries such as Greece, India, and Egypt. These experiences influenced his writing and helped him develop a global perspective on societal issues.</p><p>After his passing, Gavelis' works have been translated into numerous languages and continue to be widely read and studied. In 2017, a museum dedicated to his life and legacy was opened in Vilnius, Lithuania. The museum presents a comprehensive collection of Gavelis' manuscripts, letters, photographs, and personal belongings, providing an intimate look into the life of one of Lithuania's most celebrated literary figures.</p><p>Despite his success and critical acclaim, Gavelis was not immune to the struggles of personal life. He suffered from depression and alcoholism, and his health worsened in the years leading up to his death. However, he continued to write until the very end, and his final novel, "Baron Bagge," was published posthumously in 2003. The novel explores the life of a wealthy and eccentric man who embodies the contradictions and complexities of Lithuanian society in transition.</p><p>Gavelis' impact on Lithuanian literature and culture cannot be overstated. He was a groundbreaking figure who challenged the oppressive Soviet regime and paved the way for a new era of creative freedom and expression. His works remain relevant and poignant today, offering a unique and insightful perspective on the past, present, and future of Lithuania and the world at large.</p><p></p><p>
