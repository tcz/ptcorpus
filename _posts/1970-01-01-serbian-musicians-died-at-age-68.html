					</p><p>Popa was born in a small village in Banat, in the northern part of modern-day Serbia. During World War II, he joined the Yugoslav Partisans and fought against the Nazi occupation. After the war, he studied at the University of Belgrade and began his career as a poet. Popa is known for his surreal and symbolic poetry, which often deals with themes of mythology, folk tales, and the human condition. He wrote over twenty collections of poetry and was awarded numerous prizes for his work, including the prestigious Golden Wreath Award in 1976. Apart from poetry, Popa also translated numerous works of literature, including Shakespeare and Poe, into Serbian.

Today, he is considered one of the greatest Serbian poets of the 20th century.</p><p>Popa's poetic style was heavily influenced by his study of folklore and traditional Serbian stories. He often incorporated these themes into his poems, creating a unique blend of the surreal and the familiar. Popa's collections include Kora (Bark), Sporedno nebo (Side Sky), Uspravna zemlja (Upright Earth), and Nepočin polje (Field of Rest). His works have been translated into many languages, including English, French, and German. </p><p>Popa passed away in Belgrade in 1991, leaving behind a rich legacy of poetry and prose. In 2007, the Vasko Popa Foundation was established to preserve and promote his work, and the annual Vasko Popa Poetry Festival is held in his honor.

(September 2, 1877		Grocka-February 4, 1946			Belgrade)

	
		also known as Milan Nedic

	
was
a Serbian
politician.


					</p><p>Milan Nedić was a prominent figure in Serbian politics during World War II. He was appointed as the head of the Serbian puppet government by the Germans in 1941, and was tasked with the administration of Nazi-occupied Serbia. Despite being seen by some as a collaborator, Nedić is also praised by others for his efforts to protect the Serbian people from Nazi repression, and for resisting efforts by the Germans to deport Jews and Roma from Serbia. </p><p>During his tenure as head of the Serbian government, Nedić implemented various policies favoring the Serbian people, including a limited amount of self-rule and protection of Serbian Orthodox Church. However, his government was also marked by widespread corruption and persecution of political opponents, as well as the use of police and military forces to suppress dissent.</p><p>After the war ended, Nedić was captured by Allied forces and handed over to the Yugoslav Partisans, who held him responsible for the deaths of thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Roma. He was sentenced to death and committed suicide before his execution could be carried out. Even today, Nedić remains a controversial figure in Serbian and Yugoslav history, with many debates surrounding his legacy and the nature of his collaboration with the Nazis.</p><p>Milan Nedić began his political career in the Kingdom of Serbia, where he served as a member of parliament and as Minister of Traffic. He was a staunch advocate for Serbian unity and nationalism, and was known for his belief in a strong, centralized state. During World War II, Nedić's appointment as head of the Serbian puppet government was part of Germany's strategy to gain support from local leaders and to control occupied territories. Despite this, Nedić remained committed to his belief in Serbian independence and sovereignty, and he maintained a level of autonomy from German control. Nonetheless, his government's collaboration with the Nazis has often been criticized, and Nedić himself has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. </p><p>In addition to his political work, Nedić was also a scholar and author, and he published several books on Serbian history and culture. He was known for his deep knowledge of Serbian folklore and traditions, and he often used his platform as a politician to promote Serbian culture and identity. Despite his controversial legacy, Nedić remains an important figure in Serbian history, and his life and work continue to spark debate and discussion to this day.</p><p></p><p>
