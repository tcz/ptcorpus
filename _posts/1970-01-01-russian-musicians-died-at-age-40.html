Her work often expressed her strong patriotism for her country and her deep love for the Lithuanian people, language, and culture. </p><p>Her most famous poem, "Tylios mintys" ("Silent Thoughts"), written in the midst of the Soviet occupation during World War II, is considered a powerful expression of Lithuanian nationalism and resistance to Soviet oppression. </p><p>Unfortunately, Neris was diagnosed with cancer in 1942 and died just three years later in Moscow, where she had been sent for medical treatment.
