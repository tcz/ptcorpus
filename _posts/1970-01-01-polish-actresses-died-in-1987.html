Ondra lived a relatively private life in her later years, spending much of her time in her home in the countryside outside of Hamburg.</p><p>Despite her success in film, Ondra's life was not without its challenges. She suffered from a stammer which affected her ability to perform live on stage and may have contributed to her eventual transition to film. She was also briefly married to boxer Max Schmeling before their marriage was annulled due to her being Jewish.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=1507760" title="Wikipedia article about Anny Ondra">Anny Ondra on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Hilde Weissner</h2><p><strong>Hilde Weissner</strong>
