However, the attempt failed, and Cem fled to Rhodes, where he was taken captive by the Knights of St. John. </p><p>From Rhodes, Cem was transferred to the papal palace in Rome, where he became a focus of European intrigue. Pope Innocent VIII hoped to use Cem as a means of pressuring Bayezid II, and offered him support and protection. However, the pope's interests changed when Bayezid II agreed to an alliance with Venice, and Cem was moved to the fortress of Capua, where he died on February 25, 1495, under mysterious circumstances. </p><p>Despite his lack of success in claiming the Ottoman throne, Sultan Cem became a symbol of Turkish nationalism and resistance to foreign rule, known as the "martyred sultan."
