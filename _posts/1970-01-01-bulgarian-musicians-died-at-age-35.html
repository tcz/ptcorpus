(July 18, 1837		Karlovo-February 18, 1873			Sofia)


was
a Bulgarian
revolutionary.


					</p><p>Levski is considered one of the most important figures in Bulgarian history and one of the key figures of the Bulgarian national liberation movement against Ottoman rule. He is known as the Apostle of Freedom and his legacy has been celebrated throughout Bulgaria and recognized beyond. Prior to his execution, he was a prominent leader of a national secret revolutionary organization which aimed at the liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule. He organized a network of committees and individuals throughout the country, and worked to gather and distribute weapons and ammunition for the rebel forces. Levski was a prolific writer and contributed extensively to the literary and intellectual development of Bulgarians, and participated in the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate, a national Church institution, in 1870. Today, Levski is honored as a hero and freedom fighter in Bulgaria, and his portrait appears on banknotes and stamps.</p><p>Levski was born Vasil Ivanov Kunchev and was the eldest of 12 siblings. After completing his primary education, he moved to Karlovo to work as an apprentice in his uncle's trade shop. It was during this time that he became actively involved in revolutionary activities. In 1862, he left for Belgrade where he met with Bulgarian expatriates and continued to work towards organizing and unifying Bulgarian revolutionary efforts.</p><p>Levski's efforts to create a national secret revolutionary organization were groundbreaking, as it was the first organized and structured plan for Bulgarian liberation from Ottoman rule. He employed sophisticated methods for communication, including secret codes and invisible ink, to ensure the safety of communication between the revolutionary committees.</p><p>Despite being caught by the Ottomans, interrogated and tortured, Levski refused to reveal the names of his co-conspirators, maintaining his loyalty to the movement until his execution. Today, Levski is regarded as a symbol of Bulgarian defiance against Ottoman rule and his legacy continues to inspire the people of Bulgaria.</p><p>Levski's impact on Bulgarian history is immeasurable. His revolutionary spirit and dedication to the Bulgarian cause inspired many others to join his movement, and after his death, the organization he helped form continued to grow and eventually succeeded in liberating Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in 1878. Levski's contributions to Bulgarian literature and culture were also significant. He wrote poetry, plays, and prose, and his works helped to shape the Bulgarian national identity. In addition to his role in the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate, Levski's efforts to create a national educational system were also influential. He believed that education was key to the development of Bulgarian society and worked tirelessly to establish schools in every town and village. Today, Levski is a national hero in Bulgaria, and his legacy is celebrated every year on February 19th, the date of his execution. Monuments, museums, and streets across Bulgaria bear his name, and his life continues to inspire Bulgarians to strive for freedom and independence.</p><p></p><p>
