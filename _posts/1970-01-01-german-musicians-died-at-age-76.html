(June 23, 1805		Bad Pyrmont-April 6, 1882			Berlin)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a renowned sculptor and is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the field of public monuments and memorials in Germany. Many of his notable works can be found across the country, including the equestrian statue of King Frederick William III of Prussia in front of the Berlin City Palace and the allegorical figures on the facade of the Reichstag building. Drake completed his studies in Berlin and Rome, where he was heavily influenced by the works of the Italian Renaissance masters. In addition to his sculpting, Drake was also an accomplished professor and taught at the Berlin Academy of Arts for many years. Despite living through a tumultuous period in German history, marked by the revolutions of 1848 and the unification of Germany, Drake's work maintained a timeless and classical quality that continues to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Drake was born into a family of artists and his father, Johann Heinrich Dannecker, was also a sculptor. He showed an early talent for sculpture, and his father trained him in the art from a young age. Drake's early works focused on small figurines and busts, but his later work gained more attention for its grandeur and size. He was awarded numerous honors during his lifetime, including the Order of the Red Eagle in 1862 and the Order of Merit of the Prussian Crown in 1871. In addition to his public monuments and memorials, Drake also created many private commissioned works, including tomb monuments for members of the Prussian royal family. Drake passed away in 1882 at the age of 77, but his legacy continues to live on through his sculptures and the impact he had on the field of public art in Germany.</p><p></p><p>

(October 21, 1817		Hanover-June 4, 1894			Leipzig)


was
a German
economist.


					</p><p>He was a professor of political economy at the University of Leipzig, where he studied under the famous economist Karl Marx. Roscher is best known for his contributions to the development of historical economics, which emphasized the importance of historical and cultural factors in economic thought. He was also a pioneer in the field of comparative economics, and his works on economic systems and theories of value helped advance the study of economics as a social science. In addition to his academic work, Roscher was an active participant in public policy debates, and his ideas helped shape economic policy in Germany during the late 19th century. He wrote a number of influential books, including "Grundlagen der Nationalokonomie" (Foundations of Economic Theory) and "System der Volkswirtschaft" (System of Economics). Today, Roscher is considered one of the most important German economists of the 19th century, and his work continues to influence the study of economics and political science.</p><p>Roscher was born into a family of scholars and received a broad education in the humanities before turning to economics. He published his first major work, "Die Grundlagen der Nationalökonomie," in 1854, which established him as a leading figure in the emerging field of historical economics. Roscher argued that economic development was not solely determined by material factors, such as the availability of resources and technology, but was also shaped by cultural and historical factors, such as religion, customs, and social organization. </p><p>Roscher's comparative approach to economics was also groundbreaking. He believed that economic systems could only be understood by comparing them to each other, and he drew upon historical and cross-cultural evidence to support his arguments. This approach influenced the development of economic theory in many ways, including the development of the concept of marginal utility by Austrian economist Carl Menger.</p><p>In addition to his academic contributions, Roscher was also involved in political life. He supported economic liberalism, but was critical of laissez-faire policies that he believed would lead to social inequality and political instability. He advocated for policies that would promote economic development, such as investment in infrastructure, public education, and social welfare programs.</p><p>Roscher's legacy continues to influence contemporary debates in economics and political science. His emphasis on historical and cultural factors as well as his comparative approach to economics remain important areas of inquiry, particularly in the study of globalization, development, and economic policy.</p><p></p><p>
