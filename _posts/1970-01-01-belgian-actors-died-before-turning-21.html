							Dieudonné Kabongo was born in Katanga Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo on April 5, 1959, but grew up in Belgium.

In addition to acting, he also composed music for films including "Je suis mort mais j'ai des amis" and "Qui vive". </p><p>Despite his success, Kabongo was not without controversy. In 2003, he sued the magazine "Le Vif/L'Express" for defamation after they published an article linking him to alleged criminal activities.

He was survived by his wife and two children.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=33536001" title="Wikipedia article about Dieudonné Kabongo">Dieudonné Kabongo on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/finnish-actors-died-in-1954.html' title='Finnish actors died in 1954'><strong>Finnish actors died in 1954</strong> List of the top 1 Finnish actors who died in 1954</a></li><li><a href='/filipino-musicians-died-at-age-74.html' title='Filipino musicians died at age 74'><strong>Filipino musicians died at age 74</strong> List of the top 5 Filipino music stars who died when they were 74</a></li><li><a href='/english-musicians-died-at-age-50.html' title='English musicians died at age 50'><strong>English musicians died at age 50</strong> List of the top 7 English music stars who died when they were 50</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/british-actors-died-in-1958.html' title='British actors died in 1958'><strong>British actors died in 1958</strong> List of the top 15 British actors who died in 1958</a></li><li><a href='/hongkongese-actresses-died-before-turning-35.html' title='Hongkongese actresses died before turning 35'><strong>Hongkongese actresses died before turning 35</strong> List of the top 1 Hongkongese actresses who died before they turned 35</a></li><li><a href='/american-actresses-died-at-age-24.html' title='American actresses died at age 24'><strong>American actresses died at age 24</strong> List of the top 3 American actresses who died when they were 24</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
