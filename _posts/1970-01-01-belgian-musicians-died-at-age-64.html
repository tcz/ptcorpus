philosopher.


					</p><p>He is considered as one of the most significant literary theorists of the 20th century. Paul de Man was a prominent member of the Yale School of deconstruction and played a critical role in introducing deconstruction to the field of literary criticism in the United States. He was a highly influential figure in the development of philosophical thought on the relationship between language, meaning, and interpretation. His major works include "Blindness and Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism" and "Allegories of Reading: Figural Language in Rousseau, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Proust." However, de Man's legacy has been complicated by his well-publicized involvement with the collaborationist press in Belgium during World War II, which was revealed after his death. This revelation caused a great controversy and debate over de Man's work and his personal life.</p><p>De Man began his academic career as a scholar of French literature and was a professor at Cornell University before joining the faculty at Yale in 1966. He applied the techniques of deconstruction to literary texts, emphasizing the ways in which language itself can obscure meaning and create ambiguity. De Man's work also explored the relationship between politics and literature, arguing that literary meaning is always shaped by historical and ideological factors. Despite the controversies surrounding his personal life, Paul de Man continues to be an important figure in literary theory and philosophy. His impact on the field of deconstruction remains significant, and his work has continued to inspire scholars and thinkers decades after his death.</p><p></p><p>
