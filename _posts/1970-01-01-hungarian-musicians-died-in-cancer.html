						A Retrospective, Karády Katalin: Táncdalok, and A Zsúfolt Társaság are considered classics in Hungarian music history. Karády was a popular performer during the 1930s and 1940s in Hungary, and later gained fame in other parts of Europe. However, her career was cut short due to her alleged collaboration with the Arrow Cross Party during World War II. After the war, she was imprisoned and banned from performing until 1953. Despite this setback, she continued to perform and record music until her emigration to the United States in 1956. In the US, she worked as a nurse and later lived in relative obscurity until her death in 1990. Despite controversy surrounding her political leanings, Karády's talent as a performer continues to be celebrated today.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=23593409" title="Wikipedia article about Katalin Karády">Katalin Karády on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swiss-musicians-died-at-age-53.html' title='Swiss musicians died at age 53'><strong>Swiss musicians died at age 53</strong> List of the top 10 Swiss music stars who died when they were 53</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-actors-died-in-aneurysm.html' title='Japanese actors died in Aneurysm'><strong>Japanese actors died in Aneurysm</strong> List of the top 2 Japanese actors who died in Aneurysm</a></li><li><a href='/german-actresses-died-in-2004.html' title='German actresses died in 2004'><strong>German actresses died in 2004</strong> List of the top 8 German actresses who died in 2004</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/english-actors-died-in-2011.html' title='English actors died in 2011'><strong>English actors died in 2011</strong> List of the top 14 English actors who died in 2011</a></li><li><a href='/chinese-actresses-died-in-2011.html' title='Chinese actresses died in 2011'><strong>Chinese actresses died in 2011</strong> List of the top 2 Chinese actresses who died in 2011</a></li><li><a href='/filipino-actresses-died-in-2009.html' title='Filipino actresses died in 2009'><strong>Filipino actresses died in 2009</strong> List of the top 4 Filipino actresses who died in 2009</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
