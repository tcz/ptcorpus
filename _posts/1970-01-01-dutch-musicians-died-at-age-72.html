(September 21, 1853		Groningen-February 21, 1926			Leiden)


was
a Dutch
physicist.


					</p><p>He is most famous for his pioneering work in cryogenics, or the study of the behavior of matter at very low temperatures, which led to his discovery of superconductivity in 1911. This achievement earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1913. Throughout his career, he also made significant contributions to the study of physical properties of gases, and his research had important practical applications in fields such as refrigeration technology. Additionally, he served as the director of the Cryogenic Laboratory in Leiden, which became a prominent center for cryogenics research under his leadership. Heike Kamerlingh Onnes was an important figure in the history of physics and his work has had a lasting impact on scientific research.</p><p>Kamerlingh Onnes studied at the University of Groningen and later became a professor of experimental physics at Leiden University, where he established a reputation as one of the leading experimental physicists of his time. He also played a role in the development of quantum mechanics, a field that was still in its early stages during his lifetime. Kamerlingh Onnes was known for his meticulous attention to detail and his ability to design and build precise experimental apparatus that allowed him to make groundbreaking discoveries in the study of matter at low temperatures. In addition to his scientific achievements, Kamerlingh Onnes was also a respected teacher and mentor, and he inspired many students to pursue careers in physics. Today, he is remembered as a visionary scientist who helped to lay the foundation for modern physics.</p><p>One of Kamerlingh Onnes' major accomplishments in the field of cryogenics was the liquefaction of helium, which had been thought to be impossible. He was the first person to achieve this breakthrough in 1908, using a technique he developed using a series of compressions and expansions. This allowed him to reach extremely low temperatures, which in turn led to his discovery of superconductivity - the ability of certain materials to conduct electricity with zero resistance at extremely low temperatures. This discovery revolutionized physics and has had a major impact on fields ranging from electrical engineering to medical imaging.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Kamerlingh Onnes was also active in the broader scientific community. He served as president of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, and was a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was widely recognized for his contributions to science, receiving numerous awards and honors throughout his career.

was
a Dutch
physician.


					</p><p>He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1929 for his discovery of the cause of beriberi, a disease that results from a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). He found that the disease could be prevented by feeding chickens with brown rice instead of the polished variety, and that beriberi was caused by a nutritional deficiency rather than an infectious disease as previously thought. His discovery led to the development of thiamine supplements and the enrichment of food with vitamins, improving public health worldwide. Eijkman was also an active member of the Dutch anti-tuberculosis campaign and advocated for better sanitation and nutrition. He became a professor at the University of Utrecht and was awarded many honors throughout his career.</p><p>Eijkman was born into a family of physicians and grew up with a strong interest in medicine. He studied medicine at the University of Amsterdam and later worked as a physician in Java, where he noticed a high incidence of beriberi among the local population, particularly among prisoners and coolies who were fed on polished rice. He returned to the Netherlands in 1896 and started his research at the Institute of Physiology in Amsterdam. Eijkman's discovery of the cause of beriberi revolutionized the field of nutrition and had a significant impact on the global health industry. In addition to his research on beriberi, Eijkman also discovered the anti-beriberi factor, which was later named thiamine. Despite his numerous accomplishments, Eijkman remained humble throughout his career and always put the needs of the public and his patients first. His legacy continues to inspire nutrition scientists and medical professionals around the world.</p><p>In addition to his work in medicine, Eijkman also had a keen interest in microbiology and conducted important research on immunology.

(April 19, 1866		Amsterdam-February 4, 1939			St. Moritz)


was
a Dutch
personality.


					
			
		His child
		is

		Olga Deterding.

						</p><p>Henri Deterding was a businessman who rose to prominence as one of the founders of Royal Dutch Petroleum (later renamed Royal Dutch Shell). He began his career as a clerk for the Netherlands Trading Society, but soon moved into the oil industry. He played a key role in negotiating an agreement between Royal Dutch and Shell Transport in 1907, which created Royal Dutch Shell.</p><p>Deterding's leadership at Royal Dutch Shell was marked by his aggressive and sometimes controversial management style. He was known for his obsession with creating a vertically integrated oil company and for his efforts to expand Shell's global influence.</p><p>In addition to his business career, Deterding was also known for his personal life. He was married four times and was a well-known playboy, often seen with beautiful women and indulging in extravagant parties. He also had strong ties to the Nazi party in Germany, and some historians suggest that Deterding's sympathies towards the Nazis played a role in his opposition to British interests in the Middle East.</p><p>Despite his controversial personal and professional life, Deterding was a significant figure in the world of business and his legacy is still felt today through the continued success of Royal Dutch Shell.</p><p>Deterding remained at the helm of Royal Dutch Shell until 1936, a tenure of almost three decades. During his time in charge, he made several bold moves, including the acquisition of the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company in 1919, which gave Shell a foothold in the American market. He was also an early advocate of oil exploration in the Middle East, believing that the region held significant oil reserves.</p><p>However, Deterding's close relationship with the Nazi party and his opposition to British interests during World War II tarnished his legacy. After Germany's defeat, he retired to Switzerland, where he lived an opulent lifestyle until his death in 1939. Despite his controversial personal and political views, Deterding's impact on the oil industry and the global economy cannot be denied.</p><p>Although Henri Deterding's legacy is still felt today through Royal Dutch Shell's continued success, his connections to the Nazi party have been a cause of concern for some. During his time as the head of Shell, he made several trips to Germany where he met with Hitler and other high-ranking officials. Some historians suggest that his support for the Nazi party influenced his opposition to British interests in the Middle East and his desire to keep German oil fields under Nazi control. Despite this controversy, Deterding's contributions to the oil industry cannot be denied. In addition to his business success, he was a prolific philanthropist, supporting various causes including education and the arts. The University of Leipzig named a building after him in recognition of his contributions to the university. Overall, despite his controversial personal and political views, Henri Deterding's impact on the oil industry and the global economy remains significant.</p><p></p><p>

His work as a playwright is believed to have influenced French literature, and his play "Jephté" is considered to have been an inspiration for Jean Racine's famous play of the same name. </p><p>Van den Enden's radical views and involvement in political movements ultimately led to his downfall. He was arrested in Amsterdam in 1665 on charges of plotting to overthrow the monarchy and was subsequently exiled from the Netherlands. He lived for a time in Hamburg before being expelled from the city for his controversial views. He eventually settled in Paris, where he continued to teach philosophy and remained politically active until his death in 1674.</p><p>Van den Enden's influence extended not only to philosophy and literature but also to politics. He was an advocate for democratic principles and believed in the idea of popular sovereignty. Van den Enden's political philosophy was deeply influenced by ancient Greek and Roman thinkers, such as Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero. He believed that political power should be in the hands of the people rather than in the hands of a monarch or a small group of elites.</p><p>Van den Enden's ideas on education were also influential. He believed in the importance of a liberal education that would prepare individuals to think independently and critically. He proposed a system of education where students would study natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and history, and would be taught to reason and argue logically.</p><p>Despite being exiled from multiple countries, Van den Enden's ideas continued to be discussed and debated by philosophers, writers, and political activists in Europe. His work is regarded as an important contribution to the development of modern Western philosophy and political thought.</p><p></p><p>
