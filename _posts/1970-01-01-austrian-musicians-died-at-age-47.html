(July 1, 1818		Buda-August 13, 1865			Vienna)

	
		also known as Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis

	
was
an Austrian
physician and scientist.


					</p><p>He is credited with pioneering the concept of hand hygiene and antiseptic procedures in medical practice. Semmelweis observed that the mortality rate among women giving birth was much higher in the ward where medical students worked than in the ward where midwives worked. He concluded that the medical students were transmitting infectious diseases, which led him to introduce hand washing with a chlorinated solution. Despite initial resistance from the medical community, Semmelweis' work ultimately laid the foundation for modern infection control practices. Sadly, he died in an asylum in Vienna, where he had been committed after suffering a mental breakdown, at the age of 47. It wasn't until years after his death that his contributions to medicine were recognized and his ideas were widely adopted.</p><p></p><p>

(February 6, 1736		Bavaria-August 19, 1783			Bratislava)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a sculptor who was known for his unique style of creating busts with exaggerated facial expressions that were meant to depict various psychological states such as anger, confusion, or madness. Messerschmidt studied in Vienna and Rome before returning to Vienna to work for the imperial court.</p><p>However, he eventually developed an obsession with the idea that he was being persecuted by demons, which caused him to abandon his career and move to Bratislava where he spent the rest of his life in seclusion. Despite this, his sculptures continued to gain popularity and are now considered some of the most important works of Austrian sculpture from the 18th century. Messerschmidt's legacy has influenced many artists beyond his time, particularly in the areas of expressionism and the psychology of art.</p><p></p><p>
