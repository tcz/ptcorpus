(July 1, 1818		Buda-August 13, 1865			Vienna)

	
		also known as Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis

	
was
an Austrian
physician and scientist.


					</p><p>He is credited with pioneering the concept of hand hygiene and antiseptic procedures in medical practice. Semmelweis observed that the mortality rate among women giving birth was much higher in the ward where medical students worked than in the ward where midwives worked. He concluded that the medical students were transmitting infectious diseases, which led him to introduce hand washing with a chlorinated solution. Despite initial resistance from the medical community, Semmelweis' work ultimately laid the foundation for modern infection control practices. Sadly, he died in an asylum in Vienna, where he had been committed after suffering a mental breakdown, at the age of 47. It wasn't until years after his death that his contributions to medicine were recognized and his ideas were widely adopted.</p><p>In addition to his work on hand hygiene, Semmelweis made significant contributions to the understanding of puerperal fever, a deadly infection that affected many women in childbirth. He believed that the disease was caused by "cadaverous particles" from autopsies conducted by medical students on pregnant women who had died from other causes. Semmelweis created strict guidelines for hygiene in obstetric clinics, including the use of hand washing and disinfectants, which dramatically reduced the incidence of puerperal fever.</p><p>Semmelweis faced significant opposition from the medical establishment, who saw his ideas as a threat to their authority. His colleagues mocked him for his theories, and he was eventually dismissed from his position at the Vienna General Hospital. Despite this setback, Semmelweis continued to promote his ideas and published several papers on hand hygiene and infection control. Today, he is recognized as a pioneer in the field of medical hygiene and his work has saved countless lives around the world.</p><p>Semmelweis was born in Buda, which is now part of Budapest, Hungary. He studied law before switching to medicine, eventually earning his medical degree from the University of Vienna in 1844. After graduation, he worked as an assistant in the maternity wards of Vienna's General Hospital, where he observed the high mortality rates of women giving birth.</p><p>In addition to his work on hand hygiene and infection control, Semmelweis made other significant contributions to medical science. He was one of the first physicians to recognize the importance of hygiene in preventing the spread of diseases. He also conducted research on the use of antiseptics and sterilization, which helped to reduce the spread of infections in hospitals.</p><p>Semmelweis' legacy continues to influence modern medicine. His work on hand hygiene is considered to be the foundation of modern infection control practices, and his ideas have been adapted for use in a wide range of settings, from hospitals to food processing plants. Today, many medical facilities have policies in place to promote hand hygiene among staff and visitors, and the use of disinfectants and sterilization techniques is standard practice.</p><p>Overall, Semmelweis' work on hand hygiene and infection control has had a lasting impact on the field of medicine. By recognizing the importance of hygiene in preventing the spread of diseases, he helped to save countless lives, and his legacy continues to inspire medical professionals around the world today.</p><p>Despite his groundbreaking work, Ignaz Semmelweis faced significant challenges during his lifetime. He was frequently dismissed and criticized by the medical establishment, who were resistant to his new ideas. His battles with depression and mental illness also contributed to his challenges, leading to his confinement in a mental institution and eventual death at the age of 47. However, his work on infection control and hand hygiene has had a lasting impact on medicine, and he is now recognized as a pioneer and visionary in the field. In 2020, the World Health Organization declared May 5th as "Hand Hygiene Day" in honor of Semmelweis and his contributions to public health.</p><p>Semmelweis' contributions to medicine have also inspired numerous books, films, and other works of art. In literature, he is a central character in the novel "The Cry and the Covenant" by Morton Thompson, which depicts his struggles to convince the medical establishment of the importance of hygiene. In cinema, his story was told in the film "The Semmelweis Reflex" by Peter Medak, which explores the psychological and emotional toll of his battles with mental illness and medical resistance. Semmelweis has also been celebrated in music, with several operas and musical compositions based on his life and work, including "Semmelweis" by George Rochberg and "Der Opfergang" by Gottfried von Einem. Today, Semmelweis remains a symbol of perseverance and dedication to the advancement of science and medicine.</p><p>Semmelweis' contributions to medicine were not only limited to hygiene and infection control. He also made groundbreaking discoveries in the fields of anatomy and physiology. In 1848, he published a paper on the structure and function of the human heart, which helped lay the foundation for modern cardiology. He also conducted research on the nervous system, demonstrating that the cerebellum was responsible for coordination and balance. Semmelweis was a prolific writer, publishing over 200 scientific papers throughout his career.</p><p>In addition to his pioneering work in medicine, Semmelweis was also a strong advocate for social justice. He openly criticized the Austrian Empire's treatment of ethnic minorities and called for greater representation and rights for these marginalized groups. He was a supporter of Hungarian nationalism and a vocal critic of the Habsburg monarchy.</p><p>Despite the many obstacles he faced during his lifetime, Semmelweis' legacy continues to inspire and inform modern medical practice. His dedication to hygiene and infection control has helped to save countless lives, and his commitment to social justice reminds us that scientific progress must also be accompanied by a commitment to human rights and dignity.</p><p></p><p>

Despite this, his sculptures continued to gain popularity and are now considered some of the most important works of Austrian sculpture from the 18th century. Messerschmidt's legacy has influenced many artists beyond his time, particularly in the areas of expressionism and the psychology of art.</p><p>While in Bratislava, Franz Xaver Messerschmidt continued to create sculptures in his unique style, but they were largely unnoticed during his lifetime.

His departure from traditional ideals of beauty and symmetry led some to criticize his work as grotesque and distorted. However, Messerschmidt's commitment to exploring the full range of human emotion and psychology has cemented his place in the canon of art history.</p><p>In addition to his "Character Heads," Messerschmidt was also known for his skill in creating elaborate and intricate metalwork. He was particularly adept at creating intricate designs and patterns using precious metals and stones, and his work in this area was highly sought after by collectors and art patrons.</p><p>Despite his mental health struggles, Messerschmidt's personal life was marked by a deep devotion to his faith.

So, we can say that Franz Xaver Messerschmidt was truly ahead of his time and left a lasting impact on the world of art.</p><p>Messerschmidt's legacy also extends beyond his sculptures and metalwork. He was an important teacher and mentor to many artists during his career, including his younger brother, Johann Baptist Georg Messerschmidt, who later became a successful painter. Messerschmidt's teachings emphasized the importance of exploring the inner psyche and emotional states in art, which was a revolutionary idea at the time.</p><p>Despite his unconventional approach to art, Messerschmidt's work was well-respected by his contemporaries. He was awarded the prestigious title of "Imperial Court Sculptor" in recognition of his talent and contributions to Austrian sculpture.</p><p>In addition to his "Character Heads," Messerschmidt also produced several other notable works, including a statue of Emperor Charles VI and a series of sculptures depicting the virtues of the Holy Roman Empire.</p><p>Today, Messerschmidt's work continues to be a source of fascination and inspiration for art lovers around the world.
