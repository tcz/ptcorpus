(January 8, 1900-November 2, 1975)


was
an American
, .


						</p><p>Fiddlin' Joe Martin was an American old-time fiddler and singer from North Carolina. He was born and raised in the southeastern part of the state and was exposed to music from an early age, as his father also played the fiddle. He began playing the instrument himself as a young boy and quickly gained a reputation as a skilled musician. </p><p>Martin became a fixture on the regional music scene and performed at various fiddlers' conventions and other events throughout the South. He was known for his lively, energetic style and his ability to improvise and create intricate arrangements on the fly. </p><p>In addition to his fiddle playing, Martin was also an accomplished singer and songwriter. He wrote and recorded many original songs, often drawing from his own experiences and observations of life in rural North Carolina. </p><p>Despite his talent and popularity, Martin never achieved widespread fame outside of his home region. However, he continued to perform and record throughout his life and his legacy as a master of old-time music continues to inspire and influence musicians today.</p><p>In the 1940s, Fiddlin' Joe Martin formed a band called the Carolina Buddies, which featured his fiddle playing and vocals alongside other talented musicians. They recorded several albums and performed on radio stations throughout the Southeast. Martin's music was deeply rooted in the traditional Appalachian style, but he also incorporated elements of blues and jazz into his playing. He was a mentor to many younger musicians and was known for his friendly, outgoing personality. In addition to his music career, Martin worked as a farmer and logger for much of his life. He died in 1975 at the age of 75, but his recordings continue to be treasured by fans of old-time music. In 2018, a documentary film about Martin's life and music was released, titled "Fiddlin'."</p><p></p><p>

(January 8, 1900		Moscow-October 12, 1969			Paris)


was
a French
, .


						</p><p>-Russian abstract painter. He initially trained as an icon painter before moving to Paris in 1923 to pursue his artistic career. Poliakoff's paintings were characterized by his use of bold colours and geometric shapes arranged in a rhythmic pattern. He was associated with the abstract art movement and was influenced by the Russian Suprematist painter Kazimir Malevich. Poliakoff's work was exhibited in major museums and galleries throughout Europe and the United States, and he was a recipient of numerous awards and honors. Today, his works can be found in the collections of many renowned museums, including the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p><p>Poliakoff's artistic career can be traced back to his childhood, during which he demonstrated an innate talent for both music and visual art. His parents' professional background in the arts, as a composer and violinist respectively, likely influenced this early passion. Eventually, he decided to pursue painting and began studying iconography at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture. </p><p>Despite his training in traditional techniques, Poliakoff's artistic style was heavily influenced by the avant-garde movements of his time, most notably the Russian Suprematism and Constructivism. After moving to Paris in the early 1920s, Poliakoff became involved with the École de Paris and began to develop his own unique style. </p><p>Poliakoff's paintings were known for their emphasis on color as the primary expressive element. He experimented with a wide variety of color combinations, often using bold, contrasting hues to create visual tension and movement within his compositions. He also made use of simple geometric shapes, such as rectangles and squares, to construct complex patterns and structures. </p><p>Over the course of his career, Poliakoff achieved considerable success, exhibiting his works in prestigious galleries and museums throughout Europe and the United States. He was awarded the prestigious Guggenheim International Award in 1962, and was elected to the French Legion of Honor in 1964. Despite this success, however, Poliakoff remained a relatively private individual, devoting most of his time and energy to his painting.</p><p></p><p>
