						</p><p>Marga Legal began her career in the 1920s as a stage actress and later transitioned into film acting. She appeared in over 160 films throughout her career, including "Die Drei von der Tankstelle" (The Three from the Filling Station), "Munchhausen," and "Das Wirtshaus im Spessart" (The Spessart Inn). Legal was known for her versatility as an actress, able to play comedic and dramatic roles with equal ease.</p><p>During World War II, Legal continued to act, but was later accused of being a Nazi sympathizer. She was banned from the entertainment industry for a period of time following the war, but eventually returned to acting in the 1950s.</p><p>In addition to her acting career, Legal was also a writer, publishing both a memoir and a play. She remained active in the entertainment industry until her death in 2001 at the age of 93.</p><p>Marga Legal's full name was Margarethe Marie Amalie Legal, and she was born into a family with a strong theatrical background. Her father, Johannes Legal, was an actor, and her mother, Marie Warmuth, was a costume designer. Legal's parents divorced when she was young, and she was raised by her mother. She attended drama school in Berlin and made her stage debut in 1926.</p><p>After making her film debut in 1927, Legal became one of the most popular actresses in Germany during the 1930s. Her comedic timing and expressive face made her a natural fit for the lighthearted musicals and comedies that were popular at the time. However, she also proved her dramatic skills in films like "Die Leuchter des Kaisers" (The Emperor's Candlesticks) and "Kameradschaft" (Comradeship).</p><p>During the war, Legal appeared in several propaganda films and performed for troops on the front lines. After the war, she was investigated by Allied authorities on suspicion of being a Nazi collaborator. She was eventually cleared of all charges, but her association with the regime damaged her career for several years.</p><p>Legal continued to act into her nineties, and she remained a beloved figure in German popular culture. She was awarded the Order of Merit of Berlin shortly before her death.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/austrian-actresses-born-in-1940.html' title='Austrian actresses born in 1940'><strong>Austrian actresses born in 1940</strong> List of the top 5 Austrian actresses who were born in 1940</a></li><li><a href='/finnish-musicians-died-at-age-70.html' title='Finnish musicians died at age 70'><strong>Finnish musicians died at age 70</strong> List of the top 16 Finnish music stars who died when they were 70</a></li><li><a href='/american-actresses-died-in-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease.html' title='American actresses died in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease'><strong>American actresses died in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</strong> List of the top 4 American actresses who died in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/english-actors-died-in-1988.html' title='English actors died in 1988'><strong>English actors died in 1988</strong> List of the top 15 English actors who died in 1988</a></li><li><a href='/australian-actresses-died-in-1969.html' title='Australian actresses died in 1969'><strong>Australian actresses died in 1969</strong> List of the top 2 Australian actresses who died in 1969</a></li><li><a href='/czechoslovakian-actors-died-in-1963.html' title='Czechoslovakian actors died in 1963'><strong>Czechoslovakian actors died in 1963</strong> List of the top 1 Czechoslovakian actors who died in 1963</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
