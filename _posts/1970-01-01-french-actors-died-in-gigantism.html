							André the Giant was known for his enormous size, standing at over 7 feet tall and weighing over 500 pounds. He began his wrestling career in France and eventually became a worldwide superstar in the sport, competing in promotions such as WWF (now WWE) and NWA. He is perhaps best known for his role in the 1987 film "The Princess Bride," in which he played the character Fezzik. Despite his intimidating size, André was known for his kind personality and was beloved by many who knew him. He suffered from acromegaly, a condition caused by excess growth hormone, which contributed to his enormous size and eventual health issues. He passed away in his sleep at the age of 46 due to heart failure. André the Giant's legacy as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time continues to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=2575" title="Wikipedia article about André the Giant">André the Giant on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/french-actors-died-in-1977.html' title='French actors died in 1977'><strong>French actors died in 1977</strong> List of the top 9 French actors who died in 1977</a></li><li><a href='/french-actresses-died-at-age-20.html' title='French actresses died at age 20'><strong>French actresses died at age 20</strong> List of the top 1 French actresses who died when they were 20</a></li><li><a href='/bangladeshi-musicians-died-at-age-41.html' title='Bangladeshi musicians died at age 41'><strong>Bangladeshi musicians died at age 41</strong> List of the top 3 Bangladeshi music stars who died when they were 41</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/brazilian-actresses-died-in-1999.html' title='Brazilian actresses died in 1999'><strong>Brazilian actresses died in 1999</strong> List of the top 2 Brazilian actresses who died in 1999</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actresses-died-in-1964.html' title='Indian actresses died in 1964'><strong>Indian actresses died in 1964</strong> List of the top 2 Indian actresses who died in 1964</a></li><li><a href='/venezuelan-musicians-died-at-age-80.html' title='Venezuelan musicians died at age 80'><strong>Venezuelan musicians died at age 80</strong> List of the top 2 Venezuelan music stars who died when they were 80</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
