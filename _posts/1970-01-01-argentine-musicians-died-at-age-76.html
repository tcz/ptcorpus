lawyer.


					</p><p>In addition to being a lawyer, Elpidio González was also a politician who served as the Vice President of Argentina from 1916 to 1922 under President Hipólito Yrigoyen. He was also a member of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, a position he held from 1924 to 1928. Gonzalez was known for his involvement in the Radical Civic Union party, which he helped found in 1891. He was also an author and wrote several books, including "El Destino Social de la Humanidad" (The Social Destiny of Humanity) and "Juicio Político a la Dictadura" (Political Judgment on the Dictatorship). Gonzalez was a prominent figure in Argentinian politics and played a significant role in shaping the country's political landscape during his lifetime.</p><p>Elpidio González was born on August 1, 1875, in Rosario, Argentina, and grew up in a politically active family. His father, Segundo N. González, was a prominent lawyer who was involved in the Radical Civic Union party. Elpidio followed in his father's footsteps and went on to study law at the University of Buenos Aires, where he graduated with honors in 1901.</p><p>After completing his education, Gonzalez worked as a lawyer in Rosario before moving to Buenos Aires to continue his legal career. In 1906, he was appointed to the National Department of Justice and worked as a legal adviser to the government.</p><p>Gonzalez's political career began in 1912 when he was elected to the National Congress as a representative of the Radical Civic Union party. He quickly rose through the ranks and was elected Vice President of Argentina in 1916 under the presidency of Hipólito Yrigoyen.</p><p>During his tenure as Vice President, Gonzalez worked to promote social and economic reforms, including improved working conditions and land redistribution for farmers. He was also a strong advocate for the expansion of women's rights, and supported women's suffrage in Argentina.</p><p>Following his time as Vice President, Gonzalez returned to the National Congress, where he continued to be an influential member of the Radical Civic Union party. He was an outspoken critic of the government's handling of economic policy and called for greater investment in education and social programs.</p><p>Elpidio Gonzalez passed away on October 18, 1951, in Buenos Aires, leaving behind a legacy as a prominent politician, lawyer, and author who played a vital role in shaping the political landscape of Argentina in the early 20th century.</p><p>In addition to his political and legal career, Elpidio Gonzalez was also an accomplished writer.

He followed this with "Juicio Político a la Dictadura" (Political Judgment on the Dictatorship) in 1929, a scathing critique of the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1930 to 1943.</p><p>Gonzalez's legacy as a political figure was complicated by the fact that he supported the controversial policy of Roca-Runciman, which allowed British companies to gain a significant foothold in Argentina's meatpacking industry in exchange for increased trade with Britain. This policy was criticized at the time for favoring foreign interests over the needs of the Argentine people, and its long-term impact on the country's economy is still a topic of debate among historians.</p><p>Despite this controversy, Elpidio Gonzalez is remembered as a passionate defender of democracy, human rights, and social justice. His contributions to the Radical Civic Union party helped shape the political landscape of Argentina during a crucial period of its history, and his writings continue to be studied and respected by scholars in his home country and around the world.</p><p></p><p>
