was
a Belgian
comics artist.


					</p><p>He is best known for creating the popular series "Tif et Tondu" in 1938, which he continued to work on until his retirement in 1992. Will began his career as an illustrator for magazines and newspapers, but his love for comics led him to create his own works. Apart from "Tif et Tondu," he also created other successful comic book series such as "Isabelle," "Olivier Rameau," and "L'Arbre aux Voeux."

In 1965, he won the Grand Prix Saint-Michel, one of the highest honors in the Belgian comics industry.

He was often praised for his ability to balance humor, adventure, and social commentary in his works. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important and influential figures in the history of Belgian comics.</p><p>In addition to his prolific career as a comics artist, Will also dabbled in other forms of art. He created murals, tapestries, and stained-glass windows that can still be seen in public buildings around Belgium. His love for art began at a young age, and he often cited painters such as Georges Remi (Hergé) and Edgar P. Jacobs as inspirations for his work.

(December 23, 1862		Verviers-November 25, 1935			Uccle)


was
a Belgian
scientist.


					</p><p>He was a historian, a philologist, and a university professor. He is best known for his pioneering work in the field of economic and social history. Pirenne studied at the University of Liège and later became a professor of medieval history at the same institution. He later taught at the University of Ghent and the Free University of Brussels. Pirenne was a prolific writer and his books, which include "Medieval Cities: Their Origins and the Revival of Trade" and "Mohammed and Charlemagne," are still widely read and influential today. He was also an active supporter of Belgian nationalism and played a crucial role in the establishment of the Université Libre de Bruxelles. Despite facing numerous personal and professional setbacks throughout his life, Pirenne remained committed to his work and made significant contributions to our understanding of the medieval world.</p><p>Pirenne's work in economic and social history was groundbreaking because he proposed that the end of the Roman Empire in the west did not signify the end of civilization, but rather a transformation of it. He argued that the continuity of trade and commerce between the Mediterranean and the North Sea was interrupted not by the Germanic invasions of the fifth century, but by the Arab conquests of the seventh century, which cut off the Mediterranean from northern Europe. This idea, known as the "Pirenne thesis", revolutionized the way historians approached the transition from antiquity to the Middle Ages. Pirenne was also a prominent public figure in Belgium and used his platform to advocate for Flemish cultural and political rights. His controversial stance on Flemish nationalism and his refusal to pledge allegiance to the German occupiers during World War I led to his imprisonment in 1916. Nevertheless, Pirenne continued to produce scholarly work while in prison, and his enduring legacy has made him one of the most influential historians of the 20th century.</p><p>In addition to his work in the field of economic and social history, Henri Pirenne was also a notable linguist and philologist. He was fluent in multiple languages, including French, Dutch, German, English, Italian, and Spanish, which allowed him to access a vast array of primary sources for his research. Pirenne was also a passionate teacher and mentor, and many of his students went on to become prominent historians and scholars in their own right. During his career, Pirenne received several prestigious honors, including the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from the University of Oxford and the Francqui Prize, which is awarded to outstanding Belgian scientists and humanists. Sadly, Pirenne's life was cut short by cancer in 1935, but his ideas and theories continue to inspire and challenge historians to this day.</p><p></p><p>
