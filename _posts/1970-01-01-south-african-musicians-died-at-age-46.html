		also known as Daisy Louisa C. De Melker

	
was
a South African
personality.


					</p><p>Daisy de Melker is remembered for being one of South Africa's most notorious serial killers. She was convicted and sentenced to death for poisoning three people, including her two husbands and her son, with strychnine between 1923 and 1932. Her crime spree only came to an end when her third husband, Robert Sproat, became suspicious of her behavior and had her arrested. Although de Melker initially only admitted to killing her son, further investigations revealed that she had also murdered her first two husbands. After a high-profile trial, she was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. Her execution took place on December 30, 1932, making her the first woman to be executed in Pretoria Central Prison. Her story has continued to capture public attention and has been the subject of books, documentaries, and movies.</p><p>Daisy de Melker was born in the Eastern Cape of South Africa in 1886. As a young woman, she moved to Johannesburg and worked as a nurse. In 1911, she married William Alfred Cowle. The couple had two children but their marriage was troubled and they divorced in 1919. The following year, she married Sydney Clarence de Melker, a man she had been seeing while still married to her first husband. Sydney de Melker died in 1923 after consuming cyanide-laced coffee, an act that was initially considered suicide.</p><p>However, suspicion fell on Daisy de Melker when her second husband's family began to investigate his death. They discovered that she had taken out life insurance policies on her husbands and son, all of whom had died under suspicious circumstances. When the police began to investigate, they also found that de Melker had purchased large amounts of strychnine, which she had used to poison her victims.</p><p>De Melker initially denied any involvement in the deaths but eventually admitted to poisoning her son, Rhodes, with strychnine. She claimed that she had done so because he was mentally ill and she did not want him to suffer. However, further investigations revealed that she had also poisoned her two husbands. She was charged with their murders and found guilty of all three murders at her trial.</p><p>Daisy de Melker's case became infamous as one of South Africa's most notorious criminal trials. It was said that her cool and calculating demeanor in court, coupled with her reputation as a nurse, made her one of the most sinister figures of her time. She was sentenced to death by hanging and executed on December 30, 1932, becoming the first woman to be hanged in Pretoria Central Prison. Her case has continued to fascinate people around the world and has been the subject of many books, documentaries, and television shows.</p><p>Despite being the first woman to be hanged in Pretoria Central Prison, de Melker's descendants have remained private about their relationship to her. Some have even changed their names to avoid association with her. Despite this, her story continues to capture the interest of true crime enthusiasts and those interested in South African history. In recent years, there have been calls to have her case re-examined, with some suggesting that she may have been innocent and wrongly convicted. However, others argue that the evidence against her was overwhelming and that she was correctly found guilty. Regardless of people's opinions on her guilt or innocence, there is no denying that Daisy de Melker's life and crimes have left an indelible mark on South African history.</p><p>It is believed that Daisy de Melker may have also been responsible for the death of her father, although this was never officially proven. Her case has been compared to that of other infamous female serial killers, such as American nurse Jane Toppan and British poisoner Mary Ann Cotton. De Melker's story has been the subject of multiple films, including the 1974 South African film "Daisy de Melker," and the 2009 film "The Pledge," starring Jack Nicholson. Despite her heinous crimes, de Melker's legacy has endured, and her case remains one of the most notorious in South African history.</p><p></p><p>
