was
an American
teacher and politician.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Lynda Bird Johnson Robb and Luci Baines Johnson.

							</p><p>Lyndon B. Johnson served as the 36th President of the United States from 1963 to 1969. He succeeded John F. Kennedy after his assassination and went on to pass significant civil rights legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He also initiated a number of social welfare programs known as the "Great Society," including Medicare and Medicaid. Prior to his presidency, Johnson served as a U.S. Representative and a U.S. Senator from Texas, where he was known for his skills in negotiation and deal-making. However, his presidency was also marked by controversy and opposition over the Vietnam War, which ultimately led to his decision not to seek re-election in 1968. Johnson died in 1973 at the age of 64.</p><p>During his presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson played a crucial role in shaping American foreign policy, especially during the Vietnam War. He escalated U.S. involvement in the conflict, leading to a substantial increase in troop numbers and bombing campaigns over North Vietnam. This policy led to significant protests across the U.S., including at universities and during mass demonstrations such as the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam. Despite opposition to the war, President Johnson continued to defend his stance until he announced he would not be seeking re-election. </p><p>Johnson was also known for his unique leadership style, which was forceful and sometimes intimidating. He was known to use tactics like "the Johnson treatment" to sway opponents and get things done in Congress, and he was not afraid to use profanity or display his temper to assert his authority. While some people admired his tenacity, others criticized him for his bullying tactics.</p><p>After his presidency, Johnson retired to his ranch in Texas. He was plagued by health problems and suffered numerous heart attacks before he died in 1973. Despite the controversy over his presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson's legacy as a champion of civil rights and social welfare programs continues to shape American politics and policy to this day.</p><p>Lyndon B. Johnson was born in Stonewall, Texas, and grew up in a rural family of modest means. He graduated from Southwest Texas State Teachers College and taught at a Mexican-American school in Cotulla, Texas, before entering politics. Johnson was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937 at the age of 29 and worked his way up the political ladder, eventually becoming the Senate Majority Leader in 1955. As a politician, he was known for his ability to work across party lines and establish relationships with other politicians.</p><p>During his presidency, Johnson also launched the War on Poverty, which aimed to combat poverty and improve economic opportunity for all Americans. The program included initiatives such as Head Start, which provided early education for disadvantaged children, and the Job Corps, which offered job training and placement for young people.</p><p>Johnson's presidency was also marked by his controversial decision to escalate the U.S. military presence in Vietnam. Despite calls for deescalation and negotiation, Johnson continued to pursue a military solution to the conflict, which ultimately led to his decision not to seek re-election in 1968. His handling of the war remains one of the most divisive issues of his presidency.</p><p>Despite his shortcomings, Lyndon B. Johnson's legacy as a transformative figure in American politics is undeniable. His impact on civil rights, social welfare, and foreign policy has left a lasting impression on our country's history.</p><p>In addition to his political legacy, Lyndon B. Johnson was also known for his personal life. He married Lady Bird Johnson, whom he met while he was a teacher, in 1934. The couple had two daughters, Lynda Bird and Luci Baines. Johnson was also known for his love of hunting and the outdoors, and he often hosted foreign dignitaries at his Texas ranch. His ranch, which is now a national park, is home to a number of exotic animals, including deer, antelope, and longhorn cattle.</p><p>Johnson's life and legacy have been the subject of numerous books and films, including Robert Caro's award-winning biography, "The Years of Lyndon Johnson," and the HBO film "All the Way," which starred Bryan Cranston as Johnson. In 2018, the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, released thousands of pages of documents and recordings from Johnson's presidency, providing new insights into his leadership style and decision-making process.</p><p></p><p>
