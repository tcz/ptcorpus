(March 31, 1872		Russian Empire-August 19, 1929			Venice)


was
a Russian
impresario, art critic and ballet.


					</p><p>Diaghilev is best known for founding the Ballets Russes, one of the most influential ballet companies of the 20th century. He was a driving force in the revitalization of ballet in Western Europe and North America. His vision was to combine choreography, music, and design into a cohesive whole to create a new kind of ballet. He worked with renowned artists, such as Igor Stravinsky, Pablo Picasso, and Henri Matisse, to create innovative productions that captured the imagination of audiences. Diaghilev was also known for his extravagant personal life and his relationships with famous artists and musicians of the time, including his romantic relationship with Vaslav Nijinsky, one of the premier dancers of the Ballets Russes. Despite his early death, Diaghilev left a lasting impact on the world of dance and the arts in general.</p><p>Diaghilev was born in a wealthy family in Russia and was educated in both law and music. He started his career as a music critic for a St. Petersburg journal, then went on to become an art critic, and in 1898, he organized his first exhibition, showcasing the works of Russian artists. He then began to organize concerts and other events, eventually forming his own company in 1907, which would become the Ballets Russes.</p><p>Under Diaghilev's direction, the Ballets Russes became known for their groundbreaking productions, which challenged the traditional conventions of ballet. Diaghilev worked closely with his collaborators to create new ballets that were both visually stunning and emotionally powerful. Some of the famous productions that he directed include "The Firebird," "Petrouchka," and "The Rite of Spring." These productions showcased the talents of many great dancers, including Anna Pavlova, Tamara Karsavina, and George Balanchine.</p><p>Diaghilev was known for his flamboyant lifestyle, which often included lavish parties and scandalous affairs. He was openly gay at a time when homosexuality was not widely accepted, and his relationship with Nijinsky was the subject of much gossip and controversy. Despite this, he was highly respected in the world of the arts and was considered to be an important figure in the cultural life of Paris.</p><p>Diaghilev died at the age of 57, while on vacation in Venice. His legacy, however, lived on through the Ballets Russes, which continued to perform after his death under the direction of other choreographers. Today, Diaghilev is remembered as a visionary artist who transformed the world of dance and helped to bridge the gap between the East and the West.</p><p></p><p>

						</p><p>Edison is most famously known for his invention of the practical incandescent light bulb, which revolutionized the way the world could be lit. He was a prolific inventor with over 1,000 patents to his name, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the alkaline storage battery. Edison was also the founder of the Edison Electric Light Company, which later merged with other companies to become General Electric. </p><p>Despite only having three months of formal education, Edison was a voracious reader and self-learner, and he had a passion for experimentation and innovation. He once said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." Edison was also known for his rigorous work ethic, often working 18 hours a day in his laboratory.</p><p>In addition to his many inventions, Edison was also a pioneer in the film industry. He built the first movie studio in West Orange, New Jersey in 1893 and produced more than 1,000 films. Edison received numerous honors during his lifetime, including the Congressional Gold Medal and induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. He passed away in 1931 at the age of 84.</p><p>Throughout his life, Thomas Edison held a number of influential positions. In 1888, he became a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and in the same year, he served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He also served as the first president of the Naval Consulting Board and as a consultant for the Panama Canal project.</p><p>Edison is often remembered for his famous feud with inventor Nikola Tesla over the best method for electrical power distribution, with Tesla advocating for alternating current and Edison promoting direct current. This dispute even led to Edison electrocuting animals publicly with alternating current to prove its dangers.</p><p>In his later years, Edison worked on developing a more natural rubber and on improving the storage battery, both of which ultimately proved unsuccessful. However, his contributions to science and technology continue to have a lasting impact on the world today.</p><p></p><p>
