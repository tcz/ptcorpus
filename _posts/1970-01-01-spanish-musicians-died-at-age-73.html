(June 25, 1852		Reus-June 10, 1926			Barcelona)

	
		otherwise known as Antoni Gaudi or Antoni Gaudí i Cornet

	
was
a Spanish
artist, architect and visual artist.


					</p><p>Gaudí is known for his unique style, as he was heavily inspired by nature and his Catholic faith, and his work is characterized by its intricate details, curvilinear forms, and use of colorful tiles, ceramics, and stained glass. Some of his most famous works include the Sagrada Familia, Park Guell, and Casa Mila. Gaudí worked on the Sagrada Familia for 40 years before his death, and the cathedral remains unfinished to this day. Despite this, it is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an iconic symbol of Barcelona. Gaudí's legacy has had a significant impact on the world of architecture and art, and his influence can still be seen in contemporary design today.</p><p>In addition to his architectural designs, Gaudí was also known for his keen attention to detail in interior design and furniture making. He was a highly religious man who incorporated his faith into his work, often designing pieces with Christian symbolism. Gaudí's work has been categorized as part of the Modernisme movement, which was prevalent in Catalonia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was also known for his innovative use of materials, such as employing discarded ceramics and glass to create elaborate mosaics on his buildings. Today, Gaudí's work remains a major tourist attraction in Barcelona, attracting millions of visitors annually.</p><p>Gaudí was born in the Catalonia region of Spain and attended school at the Escoles Pies de Reus, where he developed his love of art and design. He later attended the School of Architecture in Barcelona, where he focused on the study of Gothic architecture. After graduation, Gaudí began working on projects for Eusebi Güell, a wealthy industrialist and patron of the arts who would become one of Gaudí's most important clients and supporters.</p><p>Gaudí's designs were often controversial during his lifetime, as they challenged traditional architectural techniques and styles. However, today he is celebrated as a visionary artist who brought a unique and innovative approach to architecture and design. In addition to his famous works in Barcelona, Gaudí also designed buildings in other parts of Spain, including the Episcopal Palace of Astorga and the Casa Botines in León.</p><p>In addition to his work as an architect and artist, Gaudí was also involved in the Catalan nationalist movement and supported the idea of an independent Catalonia. He was a member of the secretive anti-monarchist group known as the Reial Acadèmia Catalana de Belles Arts de Sant Jordi, and he incorporated Catalan symbols and motifs into his designs as a way of expressing his identity and beliefs.</p><p>Despite his fame and success, Gaudí was a humble and devout man who lived a simple life. He never married and devoted himself entirely to his work, often staying up all night to sketch or work on his designs. Gaudí died at the age of 73 after being struck by a tram while walking near the Sagrada Familia. His funeral was attended by thousands of mourners, and he was buried in the crypt of the cathedral he had spent the last years of his life working on.</p><p></p><p>

was
a Spanish
personality.


					</p><p>He was a Spanish conquistador, soldier and royal governor of Chile from 1557 to 1561. During his time as governor, he founded many new cities and towns in Chile, including Santiago, which is now the capital of the country. He was known for his brutal treatment of the indigenous Mapuche people, whom he subjected to cruel methods of warfare, resulting in the deaths of many natives. He also led a failed expedition to Argentina in 1562, during which many of his men died of hunger and disease. After returning to Spain, he served as a member of the Council of the Indies, which advised the king on colonial matters. De Mendoza was also a patron of the arts, and commissioned many works of art and literature.</p><p>In addition to being a patron of the arts, García Hurtado de Mendoza was a prolific writer himself, producing several works on military strategy and tactics. One of his most notable works is "Arte de la Guerra" ("The Art of War"), which is a treatise on warfare and military organization. He was also an avid collector of books, and his personal library contained over 10,000 volumes, making it one of the most extensive private libraries in Europe at the time.</p><p>Despite his controversial actions in Chile, De Mendoza was highly regarded by the Spanish monarchy, and received several appointments throughout his career.

He died in Madrid in 1609, at the age of 73.</p><p>De Mendoza's legacy in Chile is a complex one, as he is both credited with the foundation of several cities that remain important to this day, but also criticized for his brutal treatment of indigenous peoples. In addition to his military and political career, De Mendoza was an important figure in Spanish cultural life.
