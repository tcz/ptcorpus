		a.k.a. Fernando Cicero

	
was
an Eritrean
actor, film director and screenwriter.


					</p><p>He started his career in the Italian film industry during the 1950s and quickly became known for his work on popular comedies such as "Due Marines e un Generale" and "Tot√≤, Fabrizi e i giovani d'oggi". In the 1960s, Cicero began directing films, including the well-known spaghetti western "Django, Prepare a Coffin" and the crime drama "Assicurasi Vergine". </p><p>Throughout his career, Nando Cicero worked with some of the biggest names in Italian cinema, including actors such as Marcello Mastroianni and directors like Sergio Leone. Despite this, he remained largely unknown outside of Italy until recently, when a renewed interest in Italian cinema brought attention to his work. </p><p>Cicero is remembered for his contributions to Italian cinema, particularly his work on comedy and genre films. His films have been praised for their wit and style, and he is regarded as an important figure in the history of Italian cinema.</p><p>Nando Cicero was born in Asmara, Eritrea, which was then an Italian colony. He grew up in Italy and got his start in the entertainment industry as an actor in small roles. His breakthrough came when he was cast in "La Grande Guerra" (The Great War), a critically acclaimed anti-war film by Mario Monicelli. </p><p>In addition to directing and screenwriting, Cicero also worked as a character actor in films such as "Amici Miei" (My Friends) and "Il Vigile" (The Traffic Policeman). He was known for his versatility and ability to bring humor to even the most serious of roles.</p><p>Cicero's films often tackled social issues of the time, such as rising crime rates and changing gender roles, in a humorous and lighthearted way. He was also a master at parody, often taking aim at popular genres such as the spaghetti western.</p><p>Despite his success in Italy, Cicero never achieved the same level of recognition as some of his contemporaries. He continued to work in the industry until his death in 1995, but his films were largely forgotten in the years that followed. </p><p>In recent years, however, there has been a renewed interest in Italian cinema of the 1960s and 70s, and Cicero's work has been rediscovered by a new generation of film enthusiasts. Today, he is recognized as an important figure in the history of Italian cinema, and his films continue to be celebrated for their unique blend of humor, social commentary, and genre-bending experimentation.</p><p></p><p>
