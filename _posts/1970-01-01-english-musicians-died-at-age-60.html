(January 8, 1881		St Leonards-on-Sea-February 17, 1941)


was
an English
ornithologist, surgeon and writer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his extensive work on the birds of the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo. Ticehurst's career began with his training as a surgeon with the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I, but his lifelong passion for ornithology began much earlier. He was a founding member of the British Ornithologists' Club and served as its president from 1928 to 1932. </p><p>Ticehurst's most notable contributions were his publications on bird taxonomy and distribution in Southeast Asia. He authored several works on this subject, including "The Birds of British Malaya" and "The Birds of Borneo." His detailed descriptions and classifications of these birds remain valuable to modern-day ornithologists. </p><p>In addition to his ornithological work, Ticehurst was also a skilled writer and journalist. He wrote for various publications, including the Times Literary Supplement and The Field, and penned several books on non-ornithological topics. Despite his many accomplishments, Ticehurst died relatively young, at the age of 60, in his hometown of St Leonards-on-Sea.</p><p>Ticehurst's interest in ornithology was sparked during his childhood when he observed birds in the gardens of his family home. As a teenager, he began collecting bird specimens and eventually amassed a sizable collection of his own. His passion for birdwatching and ornithology only grew as he studied to become a doctor, and he continued his pursuits throughout his military service in World War I. After the war, Ticehurst turned his attention fully to ornithology and began organizing and cataloging his collections. His extensive travels throughout Southeast Asia allowed him to study and document many bird species in this area. Along with his taxonomic work, he also made important contributions to the study of bird migration patterns in this region. Through his meticulous observations and publications, Ticehurst became a respected authority in the field of ornithology and inspired many others to pursue similar passion.</p><p>In addition to his work in ornithology, Ticehurst was also an accomplished surgeon. He served in various military hospitals during World War I and was decorated for his service. After the war, he went on to work as a surgeon in London for several years before moving back to St Leonards-on-Sea to focus on ornithology full-time. Ticehurst was also an active member of his community, serving as a Justice of the Peace and a member of the Hastings Council. His passion for ornithology and his love for his local community were intertwined, as he often gave lectures and led birdwatching expeditions for local groups. Ticehurst's legacy continues today, not only through his contributions to ornithology, but also through the Ticehurst Wildlife Park, which was named in his honor and is one of the most popular nature reserves in southeastern England.</p><p></p><p>

		a.k.a. Algernon Sidney or Algernon Sydney

	
was
an English
politician.


					</p><p>Algernon Sidney is known for being a prominent Republican political theorist and one of the key figures in the Whig movement. He was a strong advocate for constitutional government and individual liberties, which often brought him into conflict with the monarchy and the ruling class of his time. Sidney also served as a member of Parliament and was a vocal opponent of the policies of King Charles II. His political writings, including his book "Discourses Concerning Government," were highly influential in shaping the political thought of the time and continue to be studied today. Despite his controversial views and eventual execution, Sidney's legacy has endured as a champion of freedom and democracy.</p><p>Sidney was born to a prominent family, with his father being a close advisor to King Charles I. However, Sidney's views on politics and government differed greatly from his father's and he became known as a staunch opponent of the monarchy. After serving in the military during the English Civil War, Sidney went into exile in Europe where he continued to write and advocate for his ideals of democracy and individual rights. </p><p>Following the restoration of the monarchy under King Charles II, Sidney returned to England and became involved in various political movements. He was a prominent member of the Whig party and supported the Exclusion Bill which sought to prevent the Catholic James II from inheriting the throne. This put him at odds with the government and he was eventually arrested and charged with treason. Despite a lack of clear evidence against him, Sidney was found guilty and executed.</p><p>Sidney's legacy as a political thinker and advocate for freedom has continued long after his death. His ideas on constitutional government and individual liberty were influential in the American Revolution and are still studied by political theorists today. His execution has also been viewed as a symbol of resistance against tyrannical rule.</p><p>Sidney's book "Discourses Concerning Government" was a major work in the field of political philosophy. In it, he argued that government should be based on the consent of the governed and that rulers should be held accountable to the people. He also advocated for a system of checks and balances to prevent the abuse of power.</p><p>Throughout his life, Sidney was involved in various political movements and causes. He was a supporter of religious tolerance and worked to protect the rights of dissenters. He also opposed efforts to expand the powers of the monarchy and was a vocal critic of the royal court.</p><p>Despite his controversial views, Sidney was widely respected for his intelligence and integrity. He was known for his eloquence and his ability to articulate complex political ideas in a clear and concise manner.</p><p>Sidney's execution was widely condemned and viewed as a miscarriage of justice. Many saw it as evidence of the government's willingness to suppress dissent and silence critics. In the years following his death, Sidney became a symbol of resistance against tyranny and oppression. His ideas and his legacy continue to inspire those who believe in the principles of freedom, democracy, and human rights.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in hanged, drawn and quartered.

		a.k.a. Captain Grose, Catharine Macaulay or Catherine Macaulay

	
was
an English
personality.


					</p><p>She was a prominent historian, writer, and supporter of republican ideals during the 18th century. Macaulay was known for her outspoken views on the American Revolution and her criticism of British involvement in it. She was also a strong advocate for women's rights, publishing works on the subject such as "Letters on Education" and "Observations on the Reflections of the Right Honorable Edmund Burke." In addition to her writing, Macaulay was also involved in political activism, campaigning for parliamentary reform and the abolition of slavery. She remains a significant figure in British intellectual history and the history of political thought.</p><p>Macaulay was born into an affluent family and received a rigorous education in literature, history, and philosophy. She became a published author at the age of 21, with the release of her first book, "Loose Remarks on Certain Positions to be Taken For Granted in the Christian Religion." Her subsequent work included a groundbreaking eight-volume history of England, which covered the period from the accession of James I to the Glorious Revolution of 1688. </p><p>Macaulay was a strong believer in the principles of republicanism, which held that power should be held by the people rather than the monarchy or aristocracy. She was a friend of the American revolutionary leader, Benjamin Franklin, and corresponded with him extensively. She supported the American Revolution, seeing it as a struggle for the principles of liberty and equality, and was a vocal critic of the British government's policies towards the colonies. </p><p>Macaulay was also a feminist and wrote extensively on women's rights. Her work challenged the prevailing ideas of her time, arguing that women were just as rational and capable as men, and that they should have the same rights and opportunities. She believed that education was vital for women's empowerment and advocated for the inclusion of women in the public sphere. </p><p>Despite facing criticism and opposition for her ideas, Macaulay remained steadfast in her beliefs and continued to write and campaign throughout her life. Her legacy has influenced subsequent generations of historians, feminists, and political activists.</p><p>Macaulay married her second husband, Reverend Dr. George Macaulay, in 1778 at the age of 47. He was an Anglican clergyman and the union allowed her to continue publishing her works under her maiden name. Together, they lived in Binfield, near Windsor, until her death in 1791 at the age of 60. Despite Macaulay's significant contributions to English literature and political thought, her works have largely been overlooked by historians until the 20th century. Modern scholars have recognized her importance and have praised her as a pioneering feminist and republican thinker. Macaulay's writings on women's rights were particularly groundbreaking, as she challenged the traditional gender roles and advocated for equality. Today, Macaulay is remembered as a trailblazer who defied convention and fought for the principles of liberty, equality, and democracy.</p><p></p><p>
