						</p><p>He was active in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, appearing on stage and in films. Hemmings was known for his versatility and ability to play a wide range of characters. He started out in vaudeville and moved on to Broadway productions. He performed in several plays including "Show Boat" and "The Emperor Jones." Hemmings also appeared in early films, including "The Emperor Jones" (1933) starring Paul Robeson. He was often cast in supporting roles as servants or butlers due to the limited opportunities for African-American actors at the time. Despite this, Hemmings remained dedicated to his craft and helped pave the way for later generations of Black actors.</p><p>In addition to his acting career, Hemmings was also a talented musician and composer. He played the trumpet and the piano, and composed several songs, some of which were featured in the productions he appeared in. Hemmings was a member of the Actors Equity Association and was actively involved in advocating for better treatment of Black actors in the industry. He was married to fellow actress Mabel Carbonell and they had one daughter together. Hemmings lived in San Antonio in his later years, where he continued to perform in local theater productions. He passed away in 1958 at the age of 65. Today, Hemmings is remembered for his contributions to the entertainment industry and his role in paving the way for greater diversity and representation in Hollywood.</p><p>Hemmings was born in Falmouth, Jamaica and grew up in Kingston. His interest in the arts began at a young age, and he started performing in local productions while still in Jamaica. He later moved to the United States to pursue his career in acting and music, facing discrimination and limited opportunities due to his race. Hemmings' dedication to his craft and perseverance in the face of adversity made him a respected figure in the industry. His legacy continues to inspire aspiring actors and musicians of all backgrounds. In 2006, he was posthumously inducted into the Texas Black Sports Hall of Fame, recognizing his contributions to the arts and culture in the state.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swedish-musicians-died-in-stroke.html' title='Swedish musicians died in Stroke'><strong>Swedish musicians died in Stroke</strong> List of the top 3 Swedish music stars who died in Stroke</a></li><li><a href='/danish-actors-died-in-1979.html' title='Danish actors died in 1979'><strong>Danish actors died in 1979</strong> List of the top 3 Danish actors who died in 1979</a></li><li><a href='/argentine-actresses-died-in-cervical-cancer.html' title='Argentine actresses died in Cervical cancer'><strong>Argentine actresses died in Cervical cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Argentine actresses who died in Cervical cancer</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/austrian-actors-died-at-age-68.html' title='Austrian actors died at age 68'><strong>Austrian actors died at age 68</strong> List of the top 4 Austrian actors who died when they were 68</a></li><li><a href='/german-actresses-died-in-1960.html' title='German actresses died in 1960'><strong>German actresses died in 1960</strong> List of the top 4 German actresses who died in 1960</a></li><li><a href='/german-actors-born-in-1958.html' title='German actors born in 1958'><strong>German actors born in 1958</strong> List of the top 8 German actors who were born in 1958</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
