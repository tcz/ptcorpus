(April 15, 1814		Boston-May 29, 1877			Dorchester, Dorset)


was
an American
historian and diplomat.


					</p><p>Motley's most famous work is The Rise of the Dutch Republic, which chronicles the history of the Netherlands and Belgium from the origins of the Dutch revolt against Spanish rule in the late sixteenth century. The book was a huge success and propelled Motley to international fame. He went on to write several more historical works, including a history of the United Netherlands and a biography of John of Barneveld.</p><p>Motley also served as the American ambassador to Austria in the 1860s, where he played a key role in averting a potential conflict between Austria and Prussia. He was a strong advocate for the abolition of slavery and supported Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. Despite his successful diplomatic career, Motley's political views were often controversial and he frequently clashed with his superiors.</p><p>In addition to his historical and diplomatic pursuits, Motley was also a gifted linguist and translated several works into English, including Schiller's Wallenstein and Goethe's Faust. He was a member of numerous learned societies and was awarded several honorary degrees throughout his career.</p><p>Motley was born into a wealthy and prominent New England family and received an excellent education at Harvard University. After completing his studies, he briefly practiced law before turning his attention to writing and historical research. He struggled at first to make a living as an author, but the success of The Rise of the Dutch Republic changed all that. The book was widely praised for its meticulous research and engaging style, and it remains a classic work of history to this day.</p><p>Motley's diplomatic career was similarly distinguished, although it was not without its challenges. He was a passionate advocate for American interests abroad, but he sometimes found himself at odds with his European counterparts. Nevertheless, his efforts to prevent a war between Austria and Prussia were widely admired, and he was respected as a skilled negotiator and strategist.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Motley struggled with poor health and personal tragedy throughout his life. His first wife died young, and his second marriage was not a happy one. He also suffered from depression and other health problems, which sometimes inhibited his work. Nevertheless, he remained dedicated to his historical and diplomatic pursuits until his death, and he is remembered today as one of America's greatest scholars and public servants.</p><p></p><p>

(July 13, 1885		Magdeburg-August 22, 1948			Berlin)


was
a German
architect.


					</p><p>Adolf Behne was known for his contributions towards architectural theories and writings on modern architecture.

Behne's writings on architecture and design were influential and he played an important role in spreading modernist ideas across Germany. </p><p>During World War II, Behne was arrested by the Gestapo for his anti-Nazi sentiments and spent time in various concentration camps. He survived the war but died shortly after in Berlin. Behne's contributions to modern architecture and his emphasis on the importance of functionalism and simplicity remain relevant and respected to this day.</p><p>Additionally, Adolf Behne's books and essays on architecture, such as "Das Moderne Berlin" and "Die Kunst der Technik," were considered pioneering works in the field, and continue to be studied by students and architects alike.

Behne's writing and thinking on design and architecture was deeply rooted in his socialist convictions, and he believed that architecture should serve the needs of society as a whole, rather than just the wealthy and privileged. Despite being persecuted by the Nazi regime, Behne never lost faith in the transformative power of architecture and design, and his legacy continues to inspire architects and designers around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(August 12, 1880		Bournemouth-October 7, 1943			London)


was
a British
writer and novelist.


					</p><p>She is best known for her novel "The Well of Loneliness" which was first published in 1928. The novel dealt with lesbianism in a frank and open manner, and as a result was highly controversial at the time. Despite the controversy, the novel was a best-seller and helped to bring discussions of homosexuality into the mainstream. Hall was a prolific author and wrote many other novels, poems, and plays throughout her career. She served as an ambulance driver during World War I, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for her bravery. Throughout her life, Hall struggled with her own sexuality and faced many challenges due to her open expression of her LGBT identity. Today, she is remembered as a trailblazer for the LGBT community and an important figure in British literature.</p><p>Hall was born Marguerite Radclyffe-Hall into a wealthy family in Bournemouth, England. She had a difficult relationship with her mother and as a result felt isolated growing up. She attended King's College London but left without getting a degree. After her service in World War I, she began writing full-time and published her first book, "The Unlit Lamp" in 1924. </p><p>"The Well of Loneliness" was Hall's most well-known work and was influential in the literary representation of same-sex love.

She was also a patron of the arts and was friends with many famous figures in the literary world, including Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf. </p><p>Hall's personal life was marked by numerous same-sex relationships, including with the artist Una Troubridge whom she met in 1915 and was with until Hall's death. Hall's struggles with her own identity, and the ostracism she faced as a result of her sexuality, led to a decline in her health in later years. She died of colon cancer at the age of 63. </p><p>Despite her problematic portrayal of homosexuality in "The Well of Loneliness", Hall's contributions to LGBT visibility cannot be denied. She opened doors for other queer writers to tell their stories, and her willingness to live authentically paved the way for later generations.</p><p></p><p>
