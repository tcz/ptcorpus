She was educated at the Hollandsch-Inlandsche School, a Dutch-run primary school for the native population. In 1903, her family moved to Batavia (now Jakarta), where Marah Roesli continued her education at the Dutch-run Opleidingschool voor Inlandsche Ambtenaren (Training School for Native Officials).</p><p>After completing her education, Marah Roesli worked as a secretary for a government official and later as an editor for the Balai Pustaka publishing house. She began writing fiction in her spare time, drawing inspiration from her own life experiences and observations of Indonesian society. Her debut novel, Sitti Nurbaya: A Love Unrealized, was published in 1922 and immediately became a critical and commercial success. It was the first Indonesian novel to be translated into English and has since been translated into multiple languages.</p><p>Marah Roesli went on to publish several more novels and short stories, including Di Tepi Kali (On the Riverbank) and Salah Asuhan (The Wrong Upbringing), which also achieved popularity among readers.

Marah Roesli's activism and advocacy for Indonesian independence led to her arrest by the Dutch colonial government in 1926. She was released a few months later, but her experiences in prison had a lasting impact on her writing and activism. Marah Roesli continued to write and publish works until her death in 1968, leaving behind a legacy as one of Indonesia's most influential and pioneering female writers.</p><p></p><p>
