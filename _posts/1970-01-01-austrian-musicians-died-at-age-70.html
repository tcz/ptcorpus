(September 19, 1901		Atzgersdorf-June 12, 1972			Buffalo)


was
an Austrian
scientist.


					</p><p>He is the father of the general systems theory, which describes the behavior of complex systems and seeks to find principles that can be applied to various fields including biology, psychology, and sociology. Bertalanffy studied philosophy, biology, and physics in Vienna and later taught at several universities in Europe and the United States. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969 for his significant contributions to the theory of biological growth and development. Bertalanffy's work has had an enormous impact on many fields, including management, engineering, and systems analysis. His ideas have helped shape modern thinking about the interconnectedness of systems in the natural and social sciences.</p><p>Bertalanffy was born to a family of physicians and grew up in Austria. His interest in systems theory was informed by his experiences in World War I, where he witnessed the failures of centralized, hierarchical structures. He believed that an alternative approach was needed, and that complex systems required a fundamentally different type of analysis. In his early career, Bertalanffy worked as a biologist with a focus on embryology, and he became interested in the way in which biological systems were organized and how they could adapt to changing environments.</p><p>Throughout his career, Bertalanffy was a prolific writer and lecturer, and his work on general systems theory led to the publication of numerous articles, essays, and books. His most influential works include "General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications," which was published in 1968, and "Modern Theories of Development," which was published in 1950. In addition to his contributions to the field of systems theory, Bertalanffy was also deeply committed to social and political issues, and he worked to promote peace and social justice.</p><p>Bertalanffy's legacy continues to influence contemporary thinking in many fields. His emphasis on interdisciplinarity and the analysis of complex systems as a whole has influenced the development of ecological theory, cybernetics, and network science. He has been celebrated as a visionary thinker who was ahead of his time, and his ideas have been widely adopted by scholars and practitioners around the world.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Hans Horbiger or Johann Evangelist Hörbiger

	
was
an Austrian
engineer.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Attila Hörbiger and Paul Hörbiger.

						</p><p>Hanns Hörbiger is best known for his theory of "Welteislehre" or "World Ice Doctrine," which proposed that ice was the fundamental substance of the universe and that all cosmic bodies were formed from it. Despite being widely discredited by the scientific community, Hörbiger attracted a following and the Nazi Party attempted to garner support for his ideas. Outside of his controversial theories, he was a successful industrialist and inventor, holding over 70 patents in his lifetime. He founded the Hörbiger Group, which is still in operation today and is involved in engineering, manufacturing and consulting. In addition to his scientific pursuits, Hörbiger was also a member of the Austrian parliament and an advocate for the Austrian nationalist movement.</p><p>Hanns Hörbiger began his career as an apprentice in a machine shop before pursuing his studies in engineering. He went on to work for various companies, such as Siemens, and later started his own engineering firm. Hörbiger was a true inventor at heart and his numerous patents covered a wide range of technological fields, from engines to cooling systems. </p><p>Apart from his scientific and engineering accomplishments, Hörbiger was an avid mountaineer and amatuer astronomer. He drew inspiration from his observations of celestial bodies, which he attributed to the formation and movement of ice in the universe. His theories, while widely criticized, sparked a fervent debate within scientific circles and beyond. </p><p>Hörbiger's ideas were embraced by the Nazi regime in Germany, who sought to use his theories as a means of promoting the supremacy of the Aryan race. This, coupled with his nationalist views, made him a controversial figure in the post-World War I period. Despite the controversy surrounding his work, Hörbiger was a respected member of Austrian society and received numerous awards and honors throughout his life. </p><p>Today, Hanns Hörbiger is remembered mainly for his "Welteislehre," which remains a symbol of the dangers of pseudoscientific thinking and the impact of political ideology on scientific inquiry. Nonetheless, his legacy as an engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur continues to inspire future generations of scientists and entrepreneurs.</p><p></p><p>
