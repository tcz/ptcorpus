						</p><p>Abdullah Yusuf Azzam is known for his crucial role in the global jihadist movement. He helped in creating and organizing the Maktab al-Khadamat (Afghan Services Bureau), which later became Al-Qaeda. Azzam's teachings were influential in inspiring young men to join the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union in the 1980s. He co-authored several books, including "Join the Caravan" and "Defense of Muslim Lands". Azzam was assassinated in 1989 in Peshawar, Pakistan. His death remains controversial and has been attributed to various groups, including Mossad and rival jihadist factions.</p><p>Abdullah Yusuf Azzam was born in a small village in the British Mandate of Palestine and grew up in Jordan. He received his education in Jordan and then went on to complete his PhD in Islamic jurisprudence in Egypt. After completing his studies, Azzam became a teacher and preacher in Saudi Arabia and Jordan, where he gained a reputation as a charismatic scholar.</p><p>In the late 1970s, Azzam became involved in the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union. He traveled to Pakistan in 1980 to help organize the effort and was instrumental in establishing the Maktab al-Khadamat, a recruitment and fundraising organization that helped bring thousands of Arab and foreign fighters to Afghanistan. Azzam's vision was to create a global jihad movement, and he saw the Afghan resistance as the first step in this process.</p><p>Azzam's writings and lectures focused on the duty of Muslims to defend their lands and fight against oppression. He argued that jihad was not just an individual obligation but a communal one, and that Muslims around the world had a responsibility to support those who were fighting for their freedom. Azzam's ideas were influential in inspiring young men to travel to Afghanistan to join the jihad.</p><p>Azzam's influence continued to grow after his death. His teachings were cited by Osama bin Laden and other leaders within Al-Qaeda, and his vision of a global jihad movement remains a powerful force in the Islamic world today.</p><p></p><p>
