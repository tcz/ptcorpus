						</p><p>Nikolaos Stratos was a prominent Greek politician who played a significant role in the country's political landscape during the early 20th century. He was a member of the conservative People's Party and served as the country's Prime Minister from 1922 until his death later that year. Stratos was a gifted orator and a strong advocate for the interests of the Greek people, particularly in the areas of agriculture and education. In addition to his political career, he was also a respected lawyer and a passionate supporter of Greek culture and traditions. Tragically, Stratos was executed by firing squad in November 1922 for his alleged involvement in a failed attempt to establish a new government following Greece's military defeat in the Greco-Turkish War. Despite his untimely death, Stratos remains an important figure in Greek history and is remembered for his dedication to his country and his commitment to public service.</p><p></p><p>
