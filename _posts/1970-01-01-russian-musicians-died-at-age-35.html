(December 12, 1792		Constantinople-January 31, 1828			Vienna)

	
		a.k.a. Alexander Ypsilanti

	
was
a Russian
personality.


					</p><p>I'm sorry, but your previous statement is incorrect. Alexander Ypsilantis was actually a Greek-Russian nobleman and a leader of the Greek War of Independence against Ottoman rule. Born in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), he was the second son of a prominent Phanariote Greek family. Ypsilantis studied in Russia and served as an officer in the Imperial Russian Army. He later became involved in the secret Filiki Eteria society, which aimed to overthrow Ottoman rule in Greece.</p><p>In 1821, Ypsilantis led a rebellion in the Danubian Principalities (modern-day Romania) with the hope of sparking a wider uprising in Greece. However, his forces were quickly defeated by Ottoman and Russian troops, and he was forced to flee to Austria.</p><p>Despite his initial failures, Ypsilantis continued to work towards Greek independence from Austria and Russia. He died in Vienna in 1828, at the age of 35. Today, he is remembered as a national hero in Greece for his role in the Greek War of Independence.</p><p>Ypsilantis was a charismatic and influential leader who inspired many Greeks to join the fight for freedom. He was known for his bravery in battle and his strategic mind, which helped him to achieve some early successes in the war against the Ottomans. Ypsilantis also had important connections in Europe, particularly with the Russian Emperor Alexander I, which he used to gain support for the Greek cause.</p><p>Despite his achievements, Ypsilantis also had his share of controversies. Some of his fellow revolutionaries accused him of being too focused on his own personal ambitions, and he also had a strained relationship with other prominent Greek leaders like Ioannis Kapodistrias. Nevertheless, his contributions to the Greek War of Independence cannot be overlooked, and he remains a beloved figure in Greece to this day.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Roman Ungern von Sternberg or Roman Ungern-Sternberg

	
was
a Russian
warlord.


					</p><p>Roman von Ungern-Sternberg was born to a Baltic-German noble family in Austria-Hungary. He grew up in Estonia and later moved to Russia where he joined the Imperial Russian Army. He fought in World War I and was a recipient of the Cross of St. George.</p><p>After the Bolshevik Revolution, Ungern-Sternberg became opposed to the new Soviet government and led a series of campaigns against them in Siberia, Mongolia and China. He styled himself as the "Asian Attila" and claimed to be fighting to restore the Mongol Empire. </p><p>Ungern-Sternberg's actions were bloody and brutal, earning him a fearsome reputation. He was known to be particularly merciless towards Communist officials and Jews. Despite his success on the battlefield, he was increasingly seen as unpredictable and unstable, even by his own troops.</p><p>Ungern-Sternberg's downfall came in 1921 when he attempted to invade Mongolia, but was defeated by Soviet forces. He was captured and executed by firing squad in Novosibirsk in the same year.  </p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Ungern-Sternberg continues to fascinate some as a romantic hero and nationalist icon, especially in Russia and Mongolia.</p><p>During his campaigns against the Bolsheviks, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg formed alliances with various groups, including Russians who opposed the new government, Mongolian aristocrats, and Buddhist monks. He allowed local traditions and religions to flourish in areas under his control, and even converted to Tibetan Buddhism himself, earning him the nickname "the Mad Baron of Mongolia" among Western journalists. </p><p>After his death, Ungern-Sternberg became the subject of several works of literature, including the novel "The Bloody White Baron" by James Palmer, which portrays him as a brutal and delusional warlord. He has also been depicted in film and video games. </p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his actions, many people in Russia and Mongolia continue to view him as a heroic figure, emphasizing his opposition to communism and his efforts to restore traditional values and cultures in the region.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by execution by firing squad.
