(April 5, 1881-August 15, 1946)

	
		otherwise known as James Matthew Ragen, Sr.

	
was
an Irish
businessperson.


					</p><p>He was also a powerful and notorious member of the Chicago Outfit, a criminal organization that dominated organized crime in the city during the early 20th century. Ragen started his career as a boxer and later became involved in gambling and bootlegging. He quickly rose through the ranks of the Outfit and became a trusted lieutenant to boss Al Capone. Ragen was heavily involved in the gang's illegal activities, which included extortion, bribery, and murder. He was arrested numerous times but was able to avoid lengthy prison sentences due to his connections and wealth. In his later years, Ragen became involved in legitimate businesses and was known for his philanthropy in the Chicago community. However, his legacy as a ruthless criminal remains a significant part of Chicago's history.</p><p>Ragen's involvement in organized crime was not limited to the Chicago Outfit. He was also a key figure in the infamous Beer Wars of the 1920s, which saw rival gangs battle for control of the city's lucrative bootlegging industry. Ragen was known for his strategic mind and was responsible for negotiating truces and alliances with other gang leaders in order to expand the Outfit's reach. </p><p>While Ragen was feared and respected by many in the criminal underworld, he also had enemies. In 1928, he was the target of an assassination attempt outside his home, which left him severely injured. The incident led to increased scrutiny from law enforcement, and Ragen's prominence within the Outfit began to wane. </p><p>Despite his criminal past, Ragen was a respected member of the Chicago business community. He owned several successful companies, including a taxi service and a chain of movie theaters. He was also a prominent philanthropist and donated generously to local charities and political campaigns. </p><p>Ragen's life was cut short when he was gunned down outside his home in 1946. His murder remains unsolved, but it is widely believed to have been ordered by the Outfit as part of a power struggle within the organization. Despite his violent past, Ragen's influence on Chicago's history is undeniable, and he remains a fascinating and controversial figure to this day.</p><p>Ragen was born in Calumet, Michigan to Irish immigrants. He spent his early years working as a coal miner before moving to Chicago in 1908. After his brief career as a boxer, Ragen turned to a life of crime and became a member of the Egan's Rats gang. He was eventually recruited into the Chicago Outfit, where he quickly distinguished himself as a skilled and ruthless enforcer. Ragen became one of Capone's closest associates and was involved in some of the gang's most notorious activities, including the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Despite his infamy, Ragen was respected by many in the Chicago political establishment and was known for his ability to secure political favors through bribery and intimidation. Ragen's death was a turning point for the Outfit, which soon fell into disarray and eventually lost its dominance over the city's criminal underworld. Today, Ragen is remembered as a colorful and controversial figure in Chicago's history, one whose influence can still be felt in the city's politics and culture.</p><p>In addition to his involvement in organized crime and his success in legitimate business ventures, James Ragen was also a devoted family man. He married his wife, Margaret, in 1910, and the couple had five children together. Ragen was known for his generosity towards his family and was said to have doted on his children. He also maintained close relationships with his siblings and extended family members, many of whom were also involved in organized crime. Despite his criminal activities, Ragen was known for his adherence to his Catholic faith and was a regular attendee at Mass. He was also a passionate supporter of Ireland's independence movement and was involved in fundraising efforts for the cause. Ragen's life and legacy have been portrayed in several books and films, including the 1987 movie "The Untouchables," in which he is portrayed by actor John Dossett.</p><p></p><p>
