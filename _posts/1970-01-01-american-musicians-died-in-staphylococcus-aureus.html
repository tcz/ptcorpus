Garland played on thousands of country, rock and roll, and pop recordings in the 1950s and 1960s, including work with Elvis Presley, Patsy Cline, Roy Orbison, and The Everly Brothers. He was known for his innovative techniques and use of jazz harmonies in country music. Garland's career was cut short in 1961 after he was critically injured in a near-fatal car accident, which caused permanent brain damage and limited his ability to play. Despite this, he continued to compose music and had a lasting impact on the country and jazz music scenes. In 1997, he was posthumously inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=1339189" title="Wikipedia article about Hank Garland">Hank Garland on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/australian-actors-died-in-helicopter-crash.html' title='Australian actors died in Helicopter crash'><strong>Australian actors died in Helicopter crash</strong> List of the top 1 Australian actors who died in Helicopter crash</a></li><li><a href='/australian-actors-died-in-2004.html' title='Australian actors died in 2004'><strong>Australian actors died in 2004</strong> List of the top 3 Australian actors who died in 2004</a></li><li><a href='/american-musicians-died-in-uterine-cancer.html' title='American musicians died in Uterine cancer'><strong>American musicians died in Uterine cancer</strong> List of the top 3 American music stars who died in Uterine cancer</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-musicians-died-in-traffic-collision.html' title='American musicians died in Traffic collision'><strong>American musicians died in Traffic collision</strong> List of the top 50 American music stars who died in Traffic collision</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-actors-died-in-1974.html' title='Austrian actors died in 1974'><strong>Austrian actors died in 1974</strong> List of the top 3 Austrian actors who died in 1974</a></li><li><a href='/serbian-actors-died-in-2012.html' title='Serbian actors died in 2012'><strong>Serbian actors died in 2012</strong> List of the top 1 Serbian actors who died in 2012</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
