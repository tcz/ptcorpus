actor.


					</p><p>She was the daughter of a wealthy Finnish family, and started acting at a young age. Aalberg was a pioneer in the field of Finnish professional theatre, and was known for her exceptional talent and charisma as an actor. She was a versatile performer and played a wide range of roles throughout her career, from classical tragedies to contemporary dramas. Aalberg was also a prominent figure in the Finnish cultural and political scene, and was actively involved in the struggle for Finnish national identity and autonomy. Despite facing considerable challenges and discrimination as a female actor in a male-dominated profession, Aalberg became one of the most beloved and respected performers in the early history of Finnish theatre.</p><p>In addition to her acting career, Ida Aalberg was also a passionate philanthropist and champion of women's rights. She was a founding member of the Finnish Women's Association, and worked tirelessly to improve the status of women in Finnish society. Aalberg was also a patron of the arts, and supported many up-and-coming Finnish artists and writers. Her legacy in Finnish theatre and culture continues to be celebrated today, and she is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of Finnish theatre. Aalberg's influence can be seen in the work of many contemporary Finnish actors and artists, who continue to explore and expand upon the traditions she helped establish.</p><p>Aalberg's early success in Finland led to her being invited to perform in Russia, where she quickly gained acclaim for her talent and became a regular performer at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. She also performed for Tsar Nicholas II and his family on several occasions. Aalberg's success in Russia brought her international recognition and paved the way for other Finnish actors to gain recognition beyond their homeland.</p><p>Despite her busy career, Aalberg faced personal struggles, including the loss of her husband and only child. However, she persevered and continued to work in theatre, eventually becoming the director of the Finnish National Theatre in Helsinki. In her later years, Aalberg suffered from ill health and was forced to retire from the theatre. She died in St. Petersburg in 1915, at the age of 57.</p><p>Today, Aalberg's legacy lives on through the Ida Aalberg Foundation, which was established in her honor to support Finnish theatre and promote cultural exchange between Finland and Russia. The foundation has funded numerous productions and provided scholarships for young actors and artists in Finland. Aalberg's contribution to Finnish culture and society is remembered as a testament to the power of art and activism to effect positive change.</p><p>Aalberg was born into a prominent family that owned several estates and businesses, which allowed her to receive an education and pursue her passion for acting.

Aalberg's perseverance and resilience in the face of these challenges have inspired generations of Finnish women and artists.</p><p>In addition to her cultural and political work, Aalberg was also a devoted mother and wife. She married Finnish playwright Karl August Tavaststjerna in 1881, and the couple had a daughter named Irma. However, both Tavaststjerna and Irma died tragically young, leaving Aalberg devastated. Despite these personal losses, Aalberg remained dedicated to her craft and her community.</p><p>In recognition of her contributions to Finnish theatre and culture, Aalberg has been honored in numerous ways.

(December 5, 1867		Finland-February 2, 1925			Helsinki)

	
		also known as Aarne-Thompson

	
was
a Finnish
personality.


					</p><p>Antti Aarne was a scholar and a folklorist who is best known for his work in the classification of folktales. He studied at the University of Helsinki and went on to become a professor there. In 1910, he published a groundbreaking work, "Verzeichnis der Märchentypen," which was later translated to "The Types of the Folktale," in collaboration with American folklorist, Stith Thompson. This work classified folktales into various categories and has been used as a standard reference for folklorists ever since.</p><p>Aarne also collected and documented Finnish folklore and founded the Finnish Literature Society in 1919, which aimed to promote Finnish language and culture. His legacy lives on through the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Classification of Folk Tales, which is widely used to this day.</p><p>Aarne was also an accomplished linguist who mastered more than 20 languages during his lifetime. He was fluent in several Scandinavian and Slavic languages, as well as English, German, French, and Italian. In addition to his work in folktales, Aarne edited and published several volumes of Finnish oral poetry and translated works of literature from other languages into Finnish. He was highly respected in academic circles and received numerous accolades for his contributions to the field of folklore studies.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Aarne lived a relatively low-key life and was known for his reserved personality. He never married and had few close friends, preferring to devote most of his time and energy to his academic pursuits. Aarne passed away in 1925 at the age of 57, leaving behind a lasting legacy as one of Finland's most celebrated scholars and folklorists.</p><p>In addition to his work in folkloristics and linguistics, Antti Aarne was also a passionate advocate for Finnish independence.

After Finland gained independence in 1917, Aarne became involved in politics, serving as a member of parliament from 1919 until his death in 1925. He remained dedicated to supporting Finnish culture and language throughout his life, and his advocacy played a role in shaping the cultural identity of modern Finland.</p><p>Aarne's work on the classification of folktales has had a profound impact on the study of folklore around the world. His classification system, developed in collaboration with Stith Thompson, divides folktales into categories based on the main narrative elements of the story. This system has been expanded and refined by subsequent scholars, and it remains a valuable tool for analyzing and comparing folktales across different cultures.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to scholarship, the University of Helsinki established the Antti Aarne Research Foundation in 1968. The foundation supports research in the fields of folkloristics, ethnology, and related disciplines, and it has helped to advance the study of Finnish folklore and culture. Today, Aarne is remembered as a pioneering scholar whose work continues to shape our understanding of the world's folklore traditions.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Antti Aarne was said to be a solitary figure who kept to himself. He was known to be a private person who seldom talked about his personal life, and he never discussed his reasons for remaining unmarried. He was also said to be a reserved and serious individual, who preferred the company of books to that of people. Nevertheless, his passion for Finnish folklore and culture was evident in his life's work, which continues to inspire scholarship to this day.</p><p>Aarne's influence on the study of folklore extended beyond his classification system. He was among the first scholars to recognize the importance of collecting and preserving oral traditions. His work in documenting Finnish folklore helped to conserve a rich cultural heritage that might have otherwise been lost. He also emphasized the need to study folklore in its cultural context, arguing that folklore cannot be understood without a deep understanding of the culture from which it originates.</p><p>Antti Aarne's legacy as a pioneering folklorist continues to be celebrated in Finland and around the world. His work has inspired generations of scholars to study and appreciate the diversity of folk traditions. Today, his name lives on through the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Classification System, which has become a cornerstone of folklore studies. His dedication to the preservation of Finnish language and culture also continues to inspire cultural pride and national identity in Finland.</p><p></p><p>
