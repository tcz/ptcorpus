(June 19, 1874		Denmark-August 30, 1941			Copenhagen)


was
a Danish
physicist and engineer.


					</p><p>He studied at the Technical University of Denmark and went on to earn his PhD at the University of Copenhagen with his thesis on X-ray crystallography. Pedersen then worked as a researcher and professor at the University of Copenhagen, where he developed methods for precision measurement of fundamental physical constants. </p><p>In addition to his work as a physicist, Pedersen was also an accomplished engineer. He designed and constructed equipment for his own research, including X-ray tubes and crystal spectrometers. He also developed techniques for building accurate clocks and measuring magnetic fields.</p><p>During World War II, Pedersen became involved with the Danish resistance movement, using his expertise in radio communication to help transmit messages between resistance groups. He was eventually caught and executed by the Nazi regime, but his contributions to science and resistance continue to be remembered today.</p><p>Pedersen's work in X-ray crystallography was instrumental in the development of X-ray crystallography as a tool to study the structure of crystals. With his PhD thesis, he was able to provide further evidence for the existence of unit cells in crystals. This work laid the foundation for future developments in crystallography, including the discovery of the structure of DNA. </p><p>In his work as a physicist, Pedersen also made important contributions to the field of spectroscopy. He developed a technique for measuring the wavelengths of X-rays emitted by elements and used this technique to accurately determine the atomic weights of many elements. He also designed a new type of spectrometer, known as a crystal spectrometer, which was able to measure X-ray wavelengths with greater precision.</p><p>Pedersen's contributions to engineering were also significant. He developed techniques for building accurate clocks, including a pendulum clock that was used as a standard for timekeeping in Denmark. He also designed equipment for measuring magnetic fields, including a magnetometer which was used for many years at the University of Copenhagen.</p><p>Pedersen's involvement with the resistance movement in Denmark during World War II was motivated by his desire to resist the Nazi occupation of Denmark. He used his expertise in radio communication to help transmit messages between resistance groups and to gather information about Nazi activities. Despite the risks, he continued to work for the resistance until he was caught, imprisoned, and eventually executed by the Nazis.</p><p>Today, Pedersen's contributions to science and resistance continue to be remembered and honored. The Peder Oluf Pedersen Prize is awarded annually by the Danish Academy of Technical Sciences in recognition of outstanding research in the field of experimental physics. Pedersen's legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of scientific inquiry, engineering, and resistance in the face of oppression.</p><p></p><p>

(May 8, 1842		Ribe-August 27, 1909			Copenhagen)


was
a Danish
scientist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work in the field of microbiology, particularly for his studies on yeast. Hansen was employed by the Carlsberg Brewery, where he developed a method for isolating pure yeast cultures. This method revolutionized the brewing industry, as it allowed breweries to produce consistent, high-quality beer on a large scale. Hansen's work also contributed to our knowledge of microbiology in general, and he is credited with discovering several new species of yeast. In addition to his research, Hansen was also a skilled teacher and mentor, and his influence can be seen in the work of many of his students and colleagues.</p><p>Hansen was born in Ribe, Denmark, and grew up in a family of farmers. He showed an early interest in science and went on to study at the Polytechnic Institute in Copenhagen. After completing his studies, Hansen was offered a job at the Carlsberg Brewery in 1879, where he would spend the rest of his career.</p><p>One of Hansen's most significant contributions to the field of microbiology was his development of the "pure culture" method for isolating yeast strains. This method involved growing yeast cells on culture plates and then isolating individual colonies to create a pure strain. This allowed for the production of consistent and high-quality beer, as well as the study of individual strains of yeast and their characteristics.</p><p>Hansen's work on yeast also led to the discovery of several new species, including Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, which is still used in brewing today. He also made important contributions to the study of bacteria, including identifying the bacterium responsible for causing spoilage in beer and developing methods for controlling its growth.</p><p>In addition to his scientific achievements, Hansen was also a respected teacher and mentor. He trained many students who went on to make significant contributions to the field of microbiology, including Martinus Beijerinck, who discovered viruses, and Sergei Winogradsky, who pioneered the study of microbial ecology.</p><p>Hansen's legacy lives on today, not only in the brewing industry but also in the field of microbiology as a whole. He is widely considered one of the founding fathers of modern microbiology, and his pioneering work laid the foundation for many important discoveries to come.</p><p></p><p>
