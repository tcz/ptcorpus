							Lupe Vélez began her career in Mexican cinema in the late 1920s and quickly became known for her beauty and charming on-screen presence. She gained popularity in Hollywood during the 1930s and starred in films such as "The Gaucho" (1927), "Laughing Boy" (1934), and "The Girl from Mexico" (1939). Vélez was also known for her temperamental nature off-screen, which often caused conflicts with directors and co-stars.</p><p>Tragically, Vélez's life was cut short when she died by suicide at the age of 36. As rumors circulated about the circumstances of her death, they were largely debunked in the biography "Lupe Velez: The Life and Career of Hollywood's "Mexican Spitfire" by Michelle Vogel, which was published in 2012. Regardless of the rumors, Vélez remains a memorable and influential figure in Hollywood history.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=269046" title="Wikipedia article about Lupe Vélez">Lupe Vélez on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/french-actors-died-in-renal-failure.html' title='French actors died in Renal failure'><strong>French actors died in Renal failure</strong> List of the top 2 French actors who died in Renal failure</a></li><li><a href='/new-zealand-actors-died-in-1953.html' title='New Zealand actors died in 1953'><strong>New Zealand actors died in 1953</strong> List of the top 1 New Zealand actors who died in 1953</a></li><li><a href='/greek-actresses-died-at-age-79.html' title='Greek actresses died at age 79'><strong>Greek actresses died at age 79</strong> List of the top 1 Greek actresses who died when they were 79</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/thai-musicians-died-at-age-53.html' title='Thai musicians died at age 53'><strong>Thai musicians died at age 53</strong> List of the top 2 Thai music stars who died when they were 53</a></li><li><a href='/mexican-actors-died-in-1966.html' title='Mexican actors died in 1966'><strong>Mexican actors died in 1966</strong> List of the top 1 Mexican actors who died in 1966</a></li><li><a href='/costa-rican-musicians-died-at-age-75.html' title='Costa Rican musicians died at age 75'><strong>Costa Rican musicians died at age 75</strong> List of the top 1 Costa Rican music stars who died when they were 75</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
