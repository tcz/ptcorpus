(December 2, 1805		Belfast-February 17, 1852			London)


was
an Irish
scientist and botanist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering work in thermodynamics, where he introduced the concept of absolute zero temperature. This concept is now a fundamental part of modern physics. He also worked extensively on the mathematical foundations of thermodynamics and was the first to use the term "adiabatic" in a scientific context.</p><p>Thompson was a well-respected professor of natural philosophy at the University of Glasgow, where he made significant contributions to the understanding of electricity and magnetism. He was awarded numerous honors for his scientific achievements, including a knighthood in 1866, ten years after his death.</p><p>Thompson was also an accomplished botanist and was particularly interested in the study of mosses. He was a member of the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Society, two of the most prestigious scientific organizations of his time.</p><p>In addition to his scientific achievements, Thompson was also a prolific inventor and engineer. He worked on the design of early telegraph systems and developed a compass for the British Navy that was more accurate than previous models. He also helped design the first transatlantic telegraph cable, which allowed for quicker communication between Europe and North America.</p><p>Thompson's interest in science and engineering began at a young age, and he received his first education from his father, who was a mathematician and teacher. He attended the University of Glasgow at the age of 10, where he studied under some of the most influential scientists of the time.</p><p>Thompson's legacy has continued to influence science and engineering to this day. His work on thermodynamics laid the foundation for the field of engineering thermodynamics, which is critical in the design of engines, refrigeration systems, and other technologies. He is also remembered for his commitment to scientific inquiry and his dedication to advancing knowledge in his fields of study.</p><p>Throughout his life, Thompson was a prolific writer, publishing over 600 scientific papers and books on a wide range of topics. He was also a skilled public speaker and communicator, able to convey complex scientific concepts in a way that was accessible to non-experts. His popular lectures on science drew large crowds and helped to inspire a new generation of scientists.Thompson's personal life was marked by tragedy, including the deaths of his wife and several of his children. Despite these hardships, he remained devoted to his work, and his tireless efforts made him one of the most respected and influential scientists of his time. Today, he is remembered as a brilliant thinker and a pioneer in the fields of thermodynamics and engineering, whose contributions to science and technology continue to shape our world.</p><p>Thompson's impact on the field of thermodynamics extended beyond the concept of absolute zero. He also introduced the concept of the "Thomson effect," which relates to the heating or cooling of a current as it passes through a conductor. This effect is still used today in the design of thermoelectric generators and in the measurement of high temperatures.</p><p>As a botanist, Thompson contributed to the study of bryology, the scientific study of mosses and liverworts. He published a book on the subject titled "Outlines of Mineralogy, Geology, and Mineral Conchology" in 1836. In addition to his research on mosses, he also discovered several new species of algae.</p><p>Thompson's work in electrical engineering was also groundbreaking. He helped develop the theory of electric potential and was instrumental in the development of the telegraph system. His work on electromagnetic theory also influenced the generation of radio waves.</p><p>In addition to his scientific achievements, Thompson was an advocate for higher education and was instrumental in the founding of Queens College Belfast, now known as Queen's University Belfast. He also served as the president of the Royal Society from 1890 to 1895.</p><p>Thompson was a devout Christian and believed that his scientific work and religious beliefs could coexist. He argued that science was a way of exploring the wonders of God's creation. This view was controversial at the time, as many saw science and religion as incompatible.</p><p>Thompson's impact on science and engineering has been widespread and long-lasting. In addition to his numerous scientific contributions, he also inspired future generations of scientists and engineers to push the boundaries of knowledge and innovation.</p><p></p><p>

(June 17, 1884		Shimla-July 5, 1930			County Sligo)


was
an Irish
personality.


					</p><p>Cooper was a prominent figure in the Irish literary and artistic scene in the early 20th century. He was a playwright, poet, and essayist, and was particularly known for his works on Irish nationalism and political issues. He was an active member of the Irish Volunteers during the Easter Rising of 1916 and was imprisoned for his involvement. Cooper was also a close friend and collaborator of Irish poet William Butler Yeats, and the two frequently worked together on literary projects. Despite his significant contributions to Irish literature, Cooper's career was cut short when he passed away at only 46 years old.</p><p>Cooper was the son of a British colonial administrator and spent much of his early life moving from place to place within India. He was educated in England and, after a brief stint in the military, settled in Dublin in 1908. There, he became involved in the city's cultural and political life, immersing himself in the Gaelic Revival movement and participating in the founding of the Abbey Theatre. </p><p>Cooper's literary output was relatively small – he only published one collection of poems and a handful of plays – but his work was well-regarded by his contemporaries. His plays, which were performed at the Abbey Theatre, dealt with themes such as Irish mythology, peasant life, and nationalist politics. Among his most well-known works are "The People's Man" (1916) and "The Building Fund" (1917). </p><p>In addition to his literary work, Cooper was active in politics and was a member of Sinn Féin, the political party that advocated for Irish independence. During the Easter Rising of 1916, he served as an officer in the Irish Volunteers, a paramilitary organization that fought against British rule. He was arrested after the Rising and spent time in Kilmainham Gaol, the Dublin prison where many of the rebellion's leaders were held. </p><p>Despite his relatively short life and limited output, Cooper remains an important figure in Irish literary history, and his contributions to the country's nationalist movement are also well-remembered.</p><p>Following his release from prison, Cooper continued his political activities and was heavily involved in the negotiations that led to the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. He supported the treaty, which established the Irish Free State, but was critical of its limitations and ultimately fell out with many of his former comrades. In the years that followed, Cooper's health deteriorated and he became increasingly isolated. He moved to Sligo, where he died in 1930 at the age of 46. Despite his short life, Cooper's impact on Irish literature and politics was significant, and his legacy continues to be celebrated today.</p><p>Cooper was also an important figure in the early years of the Irish Republic. He was elected to the Dáil Éireann, the Irish parliament, in 1918 as a member of Sinn Féin. However, he was never particularly interested in party politics and focused more on cultural and artistic pursuits. In 1923, he was appointed to the Senate of the Irish Free State but resigned soon after due to his disillusionment with the government's policies. Cooper's death in 1930 was a great loss to the Irish literary and cultural scene, and many of his contemporaries mourned his passing. He was buried in his ancestral home of County Sligo, where a plaque now marks his grave. Today, Bryan Cooper is remembered as a significant figure in the Irish literary and nationalist movements of the early 20th century, and his contributions to Irish culture continue to be celebrated.</p><p></p><p>
