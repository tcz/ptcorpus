							Veronica Lake began her acting career in the early 1940s and quickly became one of Hollywood's most popular leading ladies. She was known for her trademark hairstyle, the "peek-a-boo" look, where her blonde hair would drape over one eye. Some of her most famous films include "Sullivan's Travels" (1941), "This Gun for Hire" (1942), and "The Blue Dahlia" (1946). However, her career began to decline in the 1950s due to personal struggles and a perceived difficult attitude on set. Later in life, Lake struggled with alcoholism and financial troubles, eventually passing away from hepatitis and acute renal failure at the age of 50. Despite her difficulties, she remains a beloved Hollywood icon and her unique style continues to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=336959" title="Wikipedia article about Veronica Lake">Veronica Lake on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Maudie Prickett</h2><p><strong>Maudie Prickett</strong>
