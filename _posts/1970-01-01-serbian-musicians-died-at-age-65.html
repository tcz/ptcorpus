In an interview just months before his death, he said, "I've always been proud to be a Yugoslav... I believe it's important to stay and fight for what you believe in, no matter how difficult it may be."</p><p>Today, Pavlović is widely regarded as one of the most important filmmakers to emerge from the former Yugoslavia, and his films continue to be studied and admired by students of cinema around the world.</p><p>Pavlović's impact on the film industry was not only limited to his own films, but also through his mentorship of young filmmakers.

(April 5, 1877		Topola-February 3, 1943			Split)

	
		also known as Ilija Trifunović Birčanin or Ilija Trifunović

	
was
a Serbian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a politician, journalist, writer and ethnographer, best known for his literary works that depict life in rural Serbia at the turn of the 20th century. Trifunović-Birčanin was a prominent figure in the cultural and political life of Serbia during the first half of the 20th century, and was a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He was also an advocate for Serbian national revival and played an important role in the unification of Serbia and Montenegro in 1918. Despite his political and social prominence, Trifunović-Birčanin remained connected to his peasant roots and his works often reflect the simple, rustic lifestyle of the Serbian countryside. He is considered one of the greatest Serbian writers of the 20th century and his works continue to be widely read and studied today.</p><p>Trifunović-Birčanin was born in the town of Topola, which was then a part of the Principality of Serbia. He completed his education in Belgrade, where he began his career as a journalist and writer. In addition to his literary works, Trifunović-Birčanin also wrote extensively on political and social issues, and was considered a leading voice in the nationalistic movement in Serbia.</p><p>During World War I, Trifunović-Birčanin served as a member of the Serbian parliament and as a representative of the Serbian government in the United States. He was instrumental in securing American support for Serbia during the war, and his efforts are credited with helping to prevent the country from falling under Austro-Hungarian control.</p><p>Trifunović-Birčanin's works include novels, short stories, and memoirs, many of which were inspired by his experiences growing up in rural Serbia. His most famous works include the novels "Birčaninova ženidba" ("The Marriage of Birčanin") and "Običaji starih Srbalja" ("Customs of Old Serbs"), as well as the memoir "Sećanja na Lampu" ("Memories of Lampa"). </p><p>Today, Trifunović-Birčanin is remembered as one of Serbia's most important cultural figures, and his legacy continues to inspire writers and intellectuals in the country.</p><p>In addition to his literary and political pursuits, Trifunović-Birčanin was also an accomplished ethnographer. He conducted extensive research into the customs and traditions of the Serbian people, and his writings on the subject are still considered valuable resources for scholars of Balkan culture. Trifunović-Birčanin was also a passionate supporter of education, and worked to establish schools and libraries in rural areas of Serbia. He believed that education was the key to preserving Serbian identity and culture in the face of external pressures. Despite his many achievements, Trifunović-Birčanin's life was not without tragedy. His daughter, Ljubica Trifunović, was killed by the Gestapo during World War II, and Trifunović-Birčanin himself died in exile in Croatia just a few years later. Today, he is remembered as a champion of Serbian culture and a tireless advocate for the rights of his people.</p><p></p><p>
