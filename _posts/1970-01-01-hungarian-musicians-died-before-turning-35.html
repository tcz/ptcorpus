was
a Hungarian
personality.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Maria Josepha of Austria, Archduke Leopold Joseph of Austria and Maria Amalia of Austria.

						</p><p>Joseph I was the eldest son of Emperor Leopold I and his third wife, Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg. From a young age, he was heavily influenced by his mother's strong Catholic faith and he was educated accordingly. In 1690, he was elected King of the Romans, a title that guaranteed him the position of Holy Roman Emperor upon his father's death. </p><p>During his reign, Joseph I undertook several military campaigns against the Ottoman Empire, scoring significant victories that expanded the Habsburg territories. He also helped secure the Spanish throne for his younger brother, Charles, by involving Austria in the War of Spanish Succession. </p><p>Despite his military achievements, Joseph I was known for his gentle disposition and his patronage of the arts. He supported the construction of several important buildings in Vienna, including the Belvedere Palace and the Karlskirche. </p><p>Joseph I's marriage to Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg was childless, but he had several children outside marriage, including Maria Josepha, who married King Augustus III of Poland, and Maria Amalia, who became the Queen of Spain. </p><p>Joseph I's sudden death at the age of 32 was a shock to Europe, particularly as he was in the midst of several important military campaigns. He was succeeded by his brother Charles VI, who went on to become one of the most significant rulers of the Habsburg Empire.</p><p>Despite his short time on the throne, Joseph I's reign had a significant impact on Habsburg history. He implemented several reforms that aimed to modernize and centralize the administration of the empire, which helped strengthen Habsburg rule in the long term. He also supported the work of composers such as Antonio Vivaldi and Johann Joseph Fux, who contributed to Vienna's reputation as a hub for music and culture. While his military campaigns against the Ottoman Empire were successful, they also had devastating consequences for the local populations, leading to widespread violence and displacement. Nevertheless, Joseph I remains a highly regarded figure in Austrian history, remembered for his patronage of the arts and his contributions to the expansion and consolidation of the Habsburg territories.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Attila Jozsef, Attila József or Pista

	
was
a Hungarian
personality.


					</p><p>Despite his early death, Attila József was one of the most influential poets of the 20th century in Hungary. He was born into poverty and grew up in an orphanage after his father left the family and his mother was unable to provide for him.

His works often dealt with themes of social injustice, oppression, and the struggles of the working class.

József's poetry was banned by the Hungarian government after his death, but he continued to be celebrated underground and eventually became recognized as one of the country's most important literary figures.</p><p>Despite his challenges, Attila József had a prolific literary career. He published his first works in his late teenage years and went on to publish multiple collections of poetry as well as plays and essays. He is widely regarded for his use of language and his ability to capture the raw emotions and struggles of the working class. József's most famous work is arguably his poem "By the Danube", which is a powerful commentary on the tragedies of war and the senselessness of violence. In addition to his contributions to literature, József was also involved in the Hungarian labor movement and fought for workers' rights. His legacy continues to inspire generations of Hungarians and he is considered a national treasure.

He was also a strong supporter of the Protestant Reformation and encouraged the spread of Protestantism throughout Hungary.</p><p>John Sigismund Zápolya's reign was marked by conflict with the Habsburgs, who opposed his rule and sought to take control of Hungary. The Habsburgs were Catholic and saw John Sigismund Zápolya's promotion of religious tolerance as a threat to the Catholic Church. After his death, the Habsburgs gained control of Hungary and implemented strict Catholic policies.</p><p>Today, John Sigismund Zápolya is remembered as a champion of religious freedom and an important figure in Hungarian history. He was posthumously recognized as a martyr of the Reformation by the Lutheran and Calvinist churches. His legacy continues to inspire those who value religious and cultural diversity.</p><p></p><p>
