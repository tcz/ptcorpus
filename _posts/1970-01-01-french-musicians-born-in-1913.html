(March 4, 1913		Tunis-April 2, 1976)


was
a French
novelist, writer and singer.


						</p><p>She was born in Tunis to a Kabyle family and spent much of her childhood in Algeria. Amrouche was a pioneer in promoting the culture and traditions of the Kabyle people through her writings and music. She gained prominence for her work "Jacqueline: Story of a Jealousy" which tackled themes of gender inequality and discrimination against women. Amrouche was a talented singer and her music often reflected her cultural background, blending Kabyle and Arab influences. She was also involved in activism, advocating for the rights of Algerians and other marginalized groups. Despite facing discrimination and persecution for her outspoken views and activism, Amrouche continued to produce important works of literature and music until her death in 1976.</p><p>In addition to her literary and musical achievements, Taos Amrouche also made significant contributions in the field of anthropology. She worked as a researcher and collaborator with prominent anthropologists, including Germaine Tillion, and was instrumental in documenting the culture and traditions of the Kabyle people. Amrouche's work played a key role in preserving the history and oral traditions of her community, and she remains a significant figure in the study of Berber culture. In recognition of her contributions, she was awarded the Grand Prix de la Ville de Paris in 1962. Despite facing numerous challenges throughout her life, Taos Amrouche remains an important and inspiring figure for her contributions to literature, music, and anthropology.</p><p>Amrouche's upbringing was marked by the tensions between her Kabyle identity and the dominant Arab-Muslim culture of the region. Her father, a progressive thinker and activist, raised his children in a multilingual and eclectic household where the family's Berber traditions were celebrated alongside French and Arabic languages and customs. Despite facing discrimination and resistance from both French colonial authorities and conservative Arab-Muslim communities, Amrouche embraced her Kabyle heritage and became a voice for cultural diversity and tolerance.</p><p>In addition to her literary and musical achievements, Taos Amrouche was also a respected intellectual and advocate for human rights. She contributed articles and essays to various magazines and journals on topics such as the Algerian War of Independence, anti-colonialism, and feminism. Amrouche was involved in various political and social movements, including the Algerian Communist Party and the French anti-fascist resistance, and her activism led to her arrest and imprisonment by French authorities in 1950.</p><p>Amrouche's legacy continues to resonate today in the work of contemporary artists and writers of North African and Berber origin who draw inspiration from her pioneering efforts to assert their cultural identities and challenge dominant narratives of history and power.</p><p></p><p>
