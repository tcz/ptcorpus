(February 26, 1876		Ossendrecht-March 1, 1895			New York City)


was
a Dutch
personality.


					</p><p>At the time of her death, Pauline Musters was known as the world's smallest woman, measuring just 61 centimeters (24 inches) tall and weighing only 2.7 kilograms (6 pounds). She was born in the Netherlands and was the daughter of a musician. Her small size was attributed to a genetic condition known as microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II. Despite her short stature, Musters was a performer and traveled extensively throughout Europe and the United States as part of various circus acts. Her popularity skyrocketed after her performance at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, where she drew huge crowds. Unfortunately, her life was cut short at the age of 19 due to complications from meningitis. Despite her brief life, Musters' legacy lives on as a symbol of perseverance and determination in the face of adversity.</p><p>During her career as a performer, it is reported that Pauline Musters was often mistreated and even taken advantage of by her managers. Though she earned a good income performing, much of her money was taken and she was left with very little. Her story sheds light on the exploitation of people with physical differences in the entertainment industry. In her honor, a life-size statue was erected in her hometown in the Netherlands, and she is remembered as one of the most famous and iconic performers of her time. Despite her struggles, Pauline Musters was a trailblazer who paved the way for acceptance and understanding of those who are different.</p><p></p><p>
						She died caused by meningitis.

She excelled in school, particularly in mathematics and languages. She was also an accomplished swimmer, often beating her sister Anne in races. Before the family went into hiding, Margot worked as an assistant nurse and volunteered at a Jewish kindergarten.
