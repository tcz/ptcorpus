									</h1><p>Here are 3 famous musicians from England died in Cerebral hemorrhage:</p><h2>Stuart Sutcliffe</h2><p><strong>Stuart Sutcliffe</strong>
(June 23, 1940		Edinburgh-April 10, 1962			Hamburg)

	
		also known as Sutcliffe, Stuart or Stuart Fergusson Victor Sutcliffe

	
was
an English
artist, singer, bassist, poet, painter, musician, visual artist and music artist.


					</p><p>He is best known for being an early member of the Beatles, playing bass guitar for the group from 1960 to 1961. However, his time with the band was brief as he decided to leave to pursue his career as a painter. Sutcliffe attended the Liverpool College of Art where he met John Lennon and became friends with him. Lennon invited Sutcliffe to join his band, then called the Quarrymen, which eventually became the Beatles. Sutcliffe was never an accomplished musician but his contribution to the band was significant, as he helped them develop their distinctive sound. Unfortunately, he died at the young age of 21 due to a brain hemorrhage, cutting short what could have been a promising career in the arts. Despite his brief time with the Beatles, Sutcliffe's legacy lives on as an important figure in the band's early history.</p><p>In addition to his role in the Beatles, Sutcliffe was also a talented artist. He had a passion for painting and drawing, and his works were heavily influenced by the art movements of the time, such as abstract expressionism and pop art. Some of his most famous works include a series of abstract expressionist paintings titled "The Hamburg Series", which he created while living in Germany.</p><p>Sutcliffe's artistry also extended to his fashion sense. He was known for his signature style of wearing tight, black leather pants and a black turtleneck sweater on stage, which became a distinctive look for early rock and roll performers.</p><p>After leaving the Beatles in 1961, Sutcliffe continued to focus on his art career. He moved to Hamburg to study at the Hamburg College of Art and continued to produce a prolific body of work. Tragically, he died just one year later from a brain hemorrhage, bringing an end to a promising career in both music and art. </p><p>Despite his short time with the Beatles and his untimely death, Stuart Sutcliffe's contributions to the band and to the art world have not been forgotten. He remains an important figure in the history of both rock and roll and modern art.</p><p>Sutcliffe's life and legacy were explored in a 1994 biopic titled "Backbeat," which told the story of the Beatles' pre-fame days in Hamburg and featured actor Stephen Dorff in the role of Sutcliffe. In addition, the Hamburg-based Stuart Sutcliffe Estate works to promote Sutcliffe's art and carries on his legacy.</p><p>Many music enthusiasts and historians recognize Sutcliffe's influence on the Beatles' early sound, particularly his use of the bass guitar as a lead instrument, which is evident in some of the band's early recordings. His impact on the band's development as artists is also noted, as his departure allowed them to move away from their skiffle/rock and roll roots and explore different musical styles.</p><p>Furthermore, Sutcliffe's brief career as a musician has inspired many artists and musicians, and his unique fashion sense has also left a lasting impact on popular culture. In his honor, the Liverpool John Moores University has an annual Stuart Sutcliffe exhibition and award.</p><p></p><p>

(January 17, 1892		Toxteth-January 9, 1949			London)


was
an English
comedian.


					</p><p>He is best known for his role as the main protagonist in the BBC radio show "It's That Man Again" (ITMA), which became hugely popular during World War II. Handley's character, known as Tommy, entertained the nation with his quick wit and humorous sketches. </p><p>Prior to ITMA, Handley had already established himself as a successful comedian in music hall and theatre productions. He had a talent for mimicry and voice acting, and often incorporated these skills into his performances. </p><p>Despite his success on radio, Handley remained modest and grounded, and continued to perform in live shows and charitable events. He was also a devoted family man, and was married to his wife Violet for over 30 years until his death in 1949 at the age of 56.</p><p>Handley was born into a working-class family in Liverpool, and began his career in show business at the age of 16 as part of a comedy duo. He later went on to perform in pantomime and variety shows, and eventually made a name for himself in London's West End. In addition to his work in comedy, Handley was also a talented musician and played the piano, trumpet, and banjo. </p><p>During World War II, Handley's popularity on ITMA made him a national treasure and he became a symbol of British resilience in the face of adversity. His catchphrases, such as "Can you hear me, mother?" and "TTFN" (ta-ta for now), became iconic and are still remembered today. Handley also used his platform to raise morale and raise funds for the war effort, performing in numerous concerts and shows for servicemen and women.</p><p>After his death in 1949, Handley was commemorated with a plaque in his birthplace of Toxteth, and his legacy lived on through recordings of his performances and documentaries about his life and career. Today, he is remembered as one of the greatest comedians of his generation, and his influence can be seen in the work of many contemporary comedians.</p><p>In addition to his success on radio, Handley also appeared in several films throughout the 1930s and 1940s. His most notable roles were in "The Ghost of St. Michael's" (1941) and "Time Flies" (1944), both of which showcased his comedic talents. Handley was also a prolific writer, and penned the scripts for many of his radio sketches and shows. He was known for his attention to detail and work ethic, often spending long hours perfecting his material. Despite his fame and success, Handley remained humble and approachable, and was beloved by colleagues and fans alike. His death in 1949 was a great loss to the entertainment industry, but his legacy has endured for generations. Today, he is remembered as a pioneer of British comedy and a true national treasure.</p><p></p><p>
