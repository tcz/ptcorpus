(June 28, 1891		Polk County-September 5, 1930			Leavenworth)


was
an Angolan
personality.


					</p><p>Carl Panzram was a notorious American serial killer and rapist, who committed crimes across the United States and also in Africa. Born in Polk County, Minnesota in 1891, Panzram had a troubled childhood and ran away from home at a young age. He lived a life of crime, burglary, arson, rape and murder for many years and was arrested several times but always managed to escape or avoid conviction. Panzram's most infamous crime was the rape and murder of a young boy on a yacht in 1928. He was eventually caught and sentenced to death. Panzram refused to show any remorse for his crimes and even wrote a detailed autobiography in prison, describing his brutal and violent life. He was executed by hanging at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas in 1930.</p><p>Known for his lack of remorse and defiance towards authority, Panzram's life and crimes have been studied by criminologists and psychologists. His autobiography, titled "Killer: A Journal of Murder," was published after his death and became a controversial piece of literature for its graphic details and insights into the mind of a serial killer. Panzram's story has been adapted into a film and an opera. Despite his heinous crimes, some have argued that examining the circumstances of his upbringing and the societal failures that contributed to his violent behavior is important in understanding and preventing similar cases in the future.</p><p>Panzram's troubled childhood was marked by physical abuse, homelessness, and institutionalization. He claimed to have been repeatedly raped and tortured while in juvenile detention, which could have contributed to his later violent behavior. Panzram also reportedly served as a soldier in the US Army and worked on African plantations before returning to the States and resuming his life of crime.</p><p>During his incarcerations, Panzram was known for his unruly behavior and attempts to escape. He famously declared, "In my lifetime I have murdered 21 human beings, I have committed thousands of burglaries, robberies, larcenies, arsons and, last but not least, I have committed sodomy on more than 1,000 male human beings. For all these things I am not in the least bit sorry." Panzram's last words before his execution were reportedly, "Hurry it up, you Hoosier bastard, I could kill a dozen men while you're screwing around."</p><p>Despite the controversy over his autobiography, many have found value in studying Panzram's life to better understand the complex factors that lead to violent and criminal behavior. Some have also used his story as a cautionary tale for how society can fail to address the root causes of crime and instead perpetuate cycles of trauma and violence.</p><p>Panzram's legacy has also been used to shed light on the issues of prison reform and the death penalty. His experiences with abuse and mistreatment while in the corrections system highlight the need for reform and better treatment of inmates. Additionally, his lack of remorse and defiance towards authority have been cited as arguments against the use of the death penalty, as it may not deter criminals like Panzram who do not fear or regret their actions.</p><p>Over the years, Panzram has also been the subject of fascination and morbid curiosity, with his name often appearing in lists of infamous American serial killers. His story has been adapted into plays, podcasts, and true crime books, further cementing his place in pop culture as a symbol of human evil and depravity.</p><p>Despite the graphic details of his crimes and his unrepentant nature, Panzram's story continues to serve as a reminder of the devastating effects of childhood trauma, abuse, and systemic failures on individuals and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>
