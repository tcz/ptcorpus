						Django Reinhardt was born to a Romani family in Belgium, and he spent most of his childhood in Romani encampments near Paris. He began playing the guitar at a young age and quickly became a skilled player, developing a unique style that blended Romani music with jazz influences. Reinhardt's career took off in the 1930s when he formed the Quintette du Hot Club de France with violinist Stéphane Grappelli. The ensemble became popular in Europe and the United States and is now regarded as one of the most influential jazz groups of all time.</p><p>Reinhardt's career was interrupted by World War II, during which time he immigrated to the United States and performed with a number of jazz greats, including Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie. He eventually returned to France and continued to perform until his death in 1953 at the age of 43. Despite his short career, Reinhardt's legacy as a guitar innovator and jazz pioneer is still celebrated today. In 2017, he was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to music.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=9039" title="Wikipedia article about Django Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/argentine-actors-died-at-age-53.html' title='Argentine actors died at age 53'><strong>Argentine actors died at age 53</strong> List of the top 2 Argentine actors who died when they were 53</a></li><li><a href='/norwegian-musicians-died-at-age-58.html' title='Norwegian musicians died at age 58'><strong>Norwegian musicians died at age 58</strong> List of the top 11 Norwegian music stars who died when they were 58</a></li><li><a href='/brazilian-actresses-died-in-cardiovascular-disease.html' title='Brazilian actresses died in Cardiovascular disease'><strong>Brazilian actresses died in Cardiovascular disease</strong> List of the top 1 Brazilian actresses who died in Cardiovascular disease</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/finnish-musicians-died-at-age-77.html' title='Finnish musicians died at age 77'><strong>Finnish musicians died at age 77</strong> List of the top 15 Finnish music stars who died when they were 77</a></li><li><a href='/singaporean-actors-died-before-turning-21.html' title='Singaporean actors died before turning 21'><strong>Singaporean actors died before turning 21</strong> List of the top 1 Singaporean actors who died before they turned 21</a></li><li><a href='/australian-musicians-born-in-1958.html' title='Australian musicians born in 1958'><strong>Australian musicians born in 1958</strong> List of the top 17 Australian  music stars who died in who were born in 1958</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
