							Beryl Measor, also known by her Chinese name, Mei Lanfang (梅兰芳), was a highly acclaimed Peking opera performer, known for her exceptional skill in male roles. Born in Shanghai to a British father and a Chinese mother, Measor started training in Peking opera at a young age under the guidance of her mother's uncle, a famous Peking opera master. She made her professional debut at the age of 18 and quickly rose to fame, becoming one of the leading performers of her time. Measor's performances were characterized by her grace, elegance, and mastery of the art of "female impersonation" in male roles, which made her a cultural icon in China. In 1935, Measor toured Europe and North America, performing to sold-out audiences and earning rave reviews from critics. She eventually settled in London and continued to perform and teach Peking opera until her death in 1965. Measor is widely regarded as one of the greatest Peking opera performers of all time, and her legacy continues to inspire generations of Chinese opera enthusiasts.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=42247213" title="Wikipedia article about Beryl Measor">Beryl Measor on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/hungarian-actors-died-in-1970.html' title='Hungarian actors died in 1970'><strong>Hungarian actors died in 1970</strong> List of the top 1 Hungarian actors who died in 1970</a></li><li><a href='/czechoslovakian-actors-died-in-1989.html' title='Czechoslovakian actors died in 1989'><strong>Czechoslovakian actors died in 1989</strong> List of the top 1 Czechoslovakian actors who died in 1989</a></li><li><a href='/czech-actresses-died-in-2013.html' title='Czech actresses died in 2013'><strong>Czech actresses died in 2013</strong> List of the top 1 Czech actresses who died in 2013</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/finnish-actors-died-at-age-45.html' title='Finnish actors died at age 45'><strong>Finnish actors died at age 45</strong> List of the top 2 Finnish actors who died when they were 45</a></li><li><a href='/georgian-musicians-died-at-age-52.html' title='Georgian musicians died at age 52'><strong>Georgian musicians died at age 52</strong> List of the top 1 Georgian music stars who died when they were 52</a></li><li><a href='/chinese-actors-died-in-2014.html' title='Chinese actors died in 2014'><strong>Chinese actors died in 2014</strong> List of the top 2 Chinese actors who died in 2014</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
