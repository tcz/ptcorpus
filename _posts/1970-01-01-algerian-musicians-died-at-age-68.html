was
an Algerian
writer and philosopher.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering work in the fields of Islamic sociology, educational philosophy, and cultural politics. Bennabi believed that the root cause of Islamic societies' decline was their reliance on external sources of knowledge and the lack of innovation in their own scholarship. He emphasized the need for Islamic societies to revive their intellectual traditions and develop their own modes of modernization that were consistent with their faith and values. His major works include "The Question of Culture in Africa," "Islam in History and Society," and "The Conditions of Renaissance." Bennabi's writings continue to shape contemporary debates around Islam, modernity, and cultural identity in the Islamic world.</p><p></p><p>
