an Irish
personality.


					</p><p>He was a noted journalist, playwright, and public speaker. O'Hagan was particularly passionate about Irish independence and often used his platform to advocate for it. He was also a member of the Clan na Gael, a secret Irish nationalist organization. O'Hagan's writings appeared in various Irish-American newspapers, including The Irish World and The Gaelic American. In addition to journalism, he wrote several stage plays, including "The Dreamer" and "The Rope of Gold." O'Hagan immigrated to the United States in 1907 and settled in New York City. He continued to be active in Irish nationalist circles and was involved in fundraising efforts for the cause. O'Hagan died suddenly in 1931 at the age of 49.</p><p>During his time in the United States, Charles O'Hagan became known for his strong oratory skills and was a popular speaker at public events. He was a frequent guest at gatherings of Irish-American organizations, where he spoke about the need for Irish independence and the oppression faced by the Irish people. O'Hagan was also involved in the Republican Party and wrote speeches for politicians who shared his views on Irish independence. Along with his journalistic and theatrical work, he was active in promoting Irish culture and language preservation. In recognition of his contributions to the Irish-American community, O'Hagan was posthumously inducted into the Irish-American Hall of Fame in 2017.</p><p>O'Hagan was born in the town of Buncrana, located in the Inishowen Peninsula of County Donegal, Ireland. He was the second of five children born to a family of modest means. Despite this, O'Hagan showed an early aptitude for writing and was an avid reader throughout his life. He attended school in Buncrana before moving to Dublin to work for a newspaper. However, O'Hagan's passion for Irish nationalism and desire for independence led him to emigrate to the United States.</p><p>In addition to his journalistic work and plays, O'Hagan was a prolific writer of poetry. His poems often focused on Irish independence and the struggles of the Irish people. O'Hagan's poetry was featured in several Irish-American publications and was well-regarded by critics. He also wrote several books on Irish history and culture, including "Ireland's Fight for Freedom" and "The Gaelic Tongue."</p><p>O'Hagan's activism and passion for Irish independence brought him into contact with several other prominent figures in the movement, including Eamon de Valera and Michael Collins. However, his association with the Clan na Gael and other nationalist organizations also made him a target of surveillance by the US government. Despite this, O'Hagan remained committed to the cause of Irish independence and continued to use his writing and speaking skills to promote it until his untimely death.</p><p>Charles O'Hagan's legacy as a passionate advocate for Irish independence and proud ambassador of Irish culture continues to inspire people today. His works remain an important part of Irish-American history and his dedication to the cause of Irish independence will always be remembered.
