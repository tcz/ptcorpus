(November 16, 1835		Cremona-February 18, 1900			Rome)


was
an Italian
mathematician.


					</p><p>Beltrami is particularly renowned for his work on non-Euclidean geometry. In 1868, he published an article in which he established a model for hyperbolic geometry, now called the Beltrami-Klein model. This was a significant contribution to the development of non-Euclidean geometry, which had captivated mathematicians since the early 19th century. </p><p>Beltrami also worked on differential equations, topology, and mathematical physics. In 1865, he was appointed to the chair of mathematical analysis at Palermo University. He later moved to Pisa and then Rome, where he held teaching positions at La Sapienza University.</p><p>In addition to his mathematical work, Beltrami was also involved in politics. He served in the Italian Parliament from 1882 to 1890 as a member of the Radical Party. Beltrami was known to be a passionate advocate for democracy, and he was critical of the church's influence on Italian politics.</p><p>Beltrami received many honors for his contributions to mathematics, including the Royal Society's Sylvester Medal in 1899. Today, he is widely regarded as one of the most important mathematicians of the 19th century.</p><p>Beltrami was born into an aristocratic family in Cremona, Italy. His father was a lawyer and magistrate, and his mother was the daughter of a prominent physician. Beltrami showed a talent for mathematics from a young age and went on to study at the University of Pavia. He received his degree in engineering and then went to Paris to study mathematics under Augustin-Louis Cauchy.</p><p>While in Paris, Beltrami became interested in non-Euclidean geometry, a field that had been explored by mathematicians such as Nikolai Lobachevsky and János Bolyai. Beltrami's work on hyperbolic geometry led to the development of the Beltrami-Klein model, which has since become a standard tool for studying non-Euclidean geometry.</p><p>Beltrami's contributions to mathematics were not limited to non-Euclidean geometry. He also made significant contributions to the theory of differential equations, topology, and mathematical physics. He was particularly interested in the application of mathematics to physics, and he worked on problems related to elasticity, hydrodynamics, and electromagnetism.</p><p>In addition to his academic work, Beltrami was also involved in politics. He was a member of the Italian Parliament from 1882 to 1890 and was known for his advocacy of democratic reform. He was critical of the influence of the church on Italian politics and was a supporter of secularism.</p><p>Beltrami received many honors for his contributions to mathematics, including the French Legion of Honor and the Royal Society's Sylvester Medal. He died in Rome in 1900 at the age of 64. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important mathematicians of the 19th century, particularly for his work on non-Euclidean geometry.</p><p></p><p>

		called
		Franz Madesani and Sardus Madesani.

						</p><p>Deledda was the first Italian woman to receive a Nobel Prize in Literature in 1926, "for her idealistically inspired writings which with plastic clarity picture the life on her native island [i.e. Sardinia] and with depth and sympathy deal with human problems in general". She often wrote about rural life in Sardinia, where she was born and spent much of her life. Her works, which include novels, short stories, and plays, explore themes such as tradition, injustice, and the oppression of women. Some of her most famous works include "Canne al Vento" ("Reeds in the Wind"), "La Madre" ("The Mother"), and "Cosima". Despite facing criticism and ostracism by the male-dominated Italian literary community, Deledda went on to become one of Italy's most celebrated writers, whose works have been translated into many languages.</p><p>Deledda's family was quite impoverished, and she had to leave school at a young age to help support them through sewing and embroidery. However, she continued to read and educate herself independently, and began writing at a young age. In 1900, she published her first novel, "Stella d'Oriente" ("Star of the East"), which was well-received.</p><p>Deledda's writing was heavily influenced by her Sardinian upbringing and the traditional customs and beliefs of her community. She often explored the conflict between old and new ways of life, and the tensions between traditional gender roles and women's desire for independence and self-determination.</p><p>In addition to her writing, Deledda was also a feminist and social activist. She advocated for women's rights and education, and was involved in various political causes. She also founded a school for young girls in her hometown of Nuoro.</p><p>Despite her success and accolades, Deledda's personal life was marked by tragedy, including the death of her husband and several of her children. She continued to write prolifically until her death in 1936, and her legacy remains an important part of Italian literature and culture.</p><p></p><p>

Beccaria conducted experiments to prove that thunderstorms were caused by electric charges in the atmosphere. He also introduced the concept of electrification by friction, which later paved the way for the development of machines that generate electricity.</p><p>Additionally, Beccaria invented an electroscope, a device used to detect and measure electric charges. He also wrote several books and treatises, including "Experimenta Dynamica," "Dell'Electricismo Artificiale," and "Dell'Electricismo Naturale ed Atmosferico."</p><p>In recognition of his contributions, Beccaria was elected to the Royal Society of London and appointed as a professor of experimental physics at the University of Turin.

He initially studied law but soon developed an interest in mathematics and natural philosophy. In 1740, he was appointed as a professor of mathematics at the University of Palermo.</p><p>After several years at Palermo, Beccaria moved to Turin and began conducting experiments on electricity. In 1753, he published "Experimenta Dynamica," which described his experiments on the mechanical properties of electricity. This work established Beccaria as a leading expert on electricity and attracted the attention of scientists across Europe.</p><p>Beccaria's most significant contribution to the field of electricity was his discovery of atmospheric electricity. In 1775, he published "Dell'Electricismo Naturale ed Atmosferico," which described his experiments on the electrical properties of the atmosphere. He demonstrated that thunderstorms were caused by electric charges in the atmosphere and introduced the concept of lightning rods to protect buildings from lightning strikes.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Beccaria was also involved in politics. He held various government positions and was a close friend of the Duke of Savoy, who later became King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia. Beccaria was a strong advocate for the reform of criminal laws and worked to improve the conditions of prisons in Italy.</p><p>Beccaria died in Turin in 1781 at the age of 64. His contributions to the field of electricity laid the groundwork for the development of modern electrical technology. Today, he is recognized as one of the most important Italian scientists of the 18th century.</p><p></p><p>
