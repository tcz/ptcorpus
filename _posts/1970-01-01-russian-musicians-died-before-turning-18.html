As a young man, he became involved in Zionist politics and immigrated to British Mandate Palestine in 1920.</p><p>After serving in the Haganah, the precursor to the Israeli Defense Forces, Harel joined the newly-formed Mossad in 1949. Under his leadership, Mossad conducted several successful intelligence operations, including the smuggling of Jewish refugees out of Iraq and the assassination of several Palestinian terrorists.</p><p>Harel retired from Mossad in 1963 and became a vocal advocate for Israel's right-wing political parties. He campaigned for the annexation of the West Bank and was a strong supporter of Jewish settlements in the territories captured in the 1967 Six-Day War.</p><p>Despite his controversial views, Harel was widely respected for his intelligence work and his contributions to Israeli national security.

Despite the controversies that surrounded his career and his political beliefs, Harel remains an iconic figure in Israel and a symbol of the country's commitment to protecting its people and securing its future.</p><p>In addition to his other accomplishments, Harel was also a key player in the establishment of Israel's nuclear program. He played a critical role in securing the technology and know-how needed to build Israel's first nuclear reactor, which was located in Dimona in the Negev desert. The reactor was built with French assistance in the late 1950s and was a source of great controversy both within Israel and in the international community.

Despite the controversy surrounding Israel's nuclear program, it remains a cornerstone of the country's defense strategy to this day.</p><p>Harel's legacy as a spymaster and Israeli patriot continues to inspire many to this day.
