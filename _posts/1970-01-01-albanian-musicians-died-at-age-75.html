(May 15, 1922		Fushëbardhë-October 13, 1997			Tirana)

	
		a.k.a. Adil Carcani

	
was
an Albanian
politician.


					</p><p>He played a prominent role in the Albanian government during the communist ruling period from 1944 to 1992. Carcani served as the Prime Minister of Albania from 1976 to 1982, succeeding Mehmet Shehu who had died under mysterious circumstances. He was a close ally of former dictator Enver Hoxha and served as the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, the country's ruling party at the time. In December 1994, he was sentenced to long-term imprisonment for charges of corruption and economic sabotage, following the fall of the communist regime. He died in prison in 1997.</p><p>As a young man, Adil Carcani was a member of the anti-fascist resistance during World War II, fighting against the Italian and German occupation of Albania. He joined the Communist Party of Albania after the war and quickly rose through the party ranks, becoming a member of the Politburo in 1971. During his tenure as prime minister, Carcani oversaw a period of industrialization and economic growth in Albania, although his policies were often criticized for their harshness and lack of concern for human rights. In his later years, Carcani became increasingly isolated within the ruling party and was eventually arrested in 1993 on charges of corruption and abuse of power. His trial was widely criticized as unfair and politically motivated. Despite his controversial legacy, Carcani is still viewed by some Albanians as a symbol of resistance against foreign oppression and a leader who worked to improve the lives of ordinary citizens.</p><p>Carcani was married and had two daughters. He was known for his strict demeanor and commitment to communist ideology. He was considered one of the closest allies and supporters of Enver Hoxha, who was the leader of Albania from 1944 until his death in 1985. However, after Hoxha's death, Carcani fell out of favor with the new leadership of the Albanian government. His arrest and imprisonment in 1993 sparked protests and unrest in the country, with many of his supporters claiming that he had been unfairly targeted by the authorities. Despite his controversial legacy, Carcani's role in shaping the history of Albania is still the subject of debate and analysis among scholars and historians.</p><p></p><p>
