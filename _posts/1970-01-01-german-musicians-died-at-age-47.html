a German
politician, screenwriter and author.


					
			
		He had
		six
		children,
		Helmut Christian Goebbels, Helga Susanne Goebbels, Heidrun Elisabeth Goebbels, Holdine Kathrin Goebbels, Hedwig Johanna Goebbels and Hildegard Traudel Goebbels.

						</p><p>Joseph Goebbels was one of Adolf Hitler's closest associates and a prominent member of the Nazi Party. He served as Minister of Propaganda from 1933 to 1945, using his skills in communication and manipulation to shape public opinion in Germany and beyond. Goebbels was also a fierce anti-Semite and played a key role in the implementation of the Final Solution, the Nazi plan for the genocide of European Jews. His suicide, along with the murder of his wife and children, came in the final days of World War II as Allied forces closed in on Berlin. He remains a controversial figure and a symbol of the worst atrocities of the Nazi regime.</p><p>Joseph Goebbels was born into a Catholic family in Rheydt, Germany. He was the son of a factory clerk and his wife, who both had strict religious beliefs. Goebbels had a clubfoot, which led to him being rejected from military service in World War I. Instead, he earned a PhD in philosophy from the University of Heidelberg in 1921.</p><p>Goebbels became involved in politics in the early 1920s and joined the Nazi Party in 1924. He quickly rose through the ranks and became one of Hitler's closest confidantes. Goebbels' main role in the party was to control the propaganda machine, which he did with great success.

(January 19, 1914		Eddelak-July 3, 1961)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a physicist and chemist who is best known for discovering the phenomenon now called the Thiessen polygons. Thiessen studied at the University of Hamburg and went on to work for the German Weather Service. During World War II, he worked for the German Army as a meteorologist, but after the war, he moved to the United States to continue his work in atmospheric science. Thiessen's work on the statistical analysis of weather patterns led to the development of the Thiessen polygons, which are used to estimate precipitation and other weather variables. In addition to his scientific work, Thiessen was also a talented musician, playing the violin and composing music. He died in a car accident in 1961 at the age of 47.</p><p>Thiessen's contributions to the field of atmospheric science were significant and have continued to impact weather analysis and mapping today. The Thiessen polygons are still widely used for calculating areal precipitation, and his research in this field laid the groundwork for further development of hydrological models. In the latter part of his career, Thiessen worked at the US Weather Bureau and contributed to the development of the first automated weather observing system. He was awarded the Clarence Leroy Meisinger Award by the American Meteorological Society in 1955 for his contributions to the science of meteorology. Thiessen is also remembered for his love of music, and his compositions for violin include a concerto and several sonatas. Thiessen's life was cut tragically short, but his impact on both science and music is still felt today.</p><p></p><p>

(September 7, 1810		Düren-February 13, 1858			Cologne)


was
a German
economist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work, "Entwickelung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln," published in 1854, which introduced the concept of marginal utility. In this work, he argued that the value of a good or service to an individual depends on the marginal utility, which is the utility gained from consuming an additional unit of that good or service. This concept was later developed by other economists such as William Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, and Léon Walras, and became a cornerstone of modern microeconomics. Despite his contributions to the field, Gossen's work was largely overlooked during his lifetime, and he died in relative obscurity. It was only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that his ideas gained wider recognition and appreciation.</p><p>Gossen was born in Düren, Germany, and studied mathematics and physics at the University of Berlin. After completing his studies, he worked as a civil servant in various government offices in Cologne, where he developed an interest in economics. He became frustrated with the prevailing economic theories of the time, which he thought were overly abstract and detached from real-world problems.</p><p>In his groundbreaking work, "Entwickelung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln," Gossen sought to develop a more practical and empirically based approach to economics. He based his analysis on the idea that human behavior is subject to empirical laws, similar to those found in the natural sciences.</p><p>Gossen's work was ahead of its time and not widely recognized in his lifetime. His writing was difficult to understand, and he lacked the support of influential economists of his time. However, his ideas were eventually rediscovered and became a foundational element of neoclassical economics. </p><p>Today, Gossen is regarded as one of the pioneers of the marginalist revolution in economics, which transformed the way economists think about the value of goods and services and the behavior of individuals in markets. His work influenced later generations of economists and helped to lay the foundation for the emergence of modern microeconomics.</p><p></p><p>

was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Hans Krebs was a highly respected biochemist and physician who made significant contributions to the field of metabolism research. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1953 for his discovery of the citric acid cycle, which is also known as the Krebs cycle. He received his medical degree from the University of Berlin and began his research career there. His work in the 1930s was overshadowed by political events, especially the rise of Nazism, which drove many Jewish and non-Aryan scientists out of their academic positions. Despite this, Krebs continued his research, and after World War II, he was invited to work at the University of Oxford in England. However, he decided to stay in Germany, and tragically, he took his own life shortly before the end of the war. Despite his untimely death, Hans Krebs's contributions to biochemistry and medicine remain highly significant to this day.</p><p>Krebs was known for his ability to think critically and to develop innovative experimental methods. He worked on the metabolism of cancer cells and was among the first researchers to suggest that cancer cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells. Krebs was also interested in the problem of diabetes and investigated how the body metabolizes glucose. He discovered the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in 1937, which plays a key role in glucose metabolism.</p><p>Krebs was a member of the Royal Society, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States, and the French Academy of Sciences. In addition to the Nobel Prize, he received numerous other awards and honors during his lifetime. The Krebs cycle, which he discovered, is a central component of cellular respiration and is studied by biochemists and medical researchers around the world.</p><p>Krebs was survived by his wife and three children. His legacy continues to inspire scientists and researchers in the field of biochemistry and medicine.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in suicide.

In addition to his work in astrophysics, Zöllner was an accomplished mathematician, publishing papers on complex analysis and geometry. He was a professor at the University of Leipzig, where he founded the Institute of Astrophysics. Despite suffering from poor health throughout his life, Zöllner made significant contributions to the field of astrophysics and remains a prominent figure in the history of astronomy.</p><p>Zöllner's interest in astronomy was sparked at an early age when he observed a solar eclipse. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Berlin, where he earned his doctorate in 1860. After earning his degree, he spent several years as an assistant astronomer at the Berlin Observatory, where he continued his studies of comets and binary stars.</p><p>In addition to his work in astrophysics, Zöllner was also involved in spiritualism, a movement popular in the late 19th century which claimed to communicate with the dead. He believed that there were connections between astronomy and spiritualism, and conducted experiments to try to prove it. However, his spiritualist beliefs were not widely accepted by the scientific community, and he faced criticism for his involvement in the movement.</p><p>Despite his controversial views, Zöllner made many important contributions to the field of astrophysics. His work on spectroscopy helped lay the foundations for modern astrophysics, and his method for determining binary star masses is still used today. Zöllner died in 1882 at the age of 47, but his legacy lives on in the contributions he made to the field of astronomy.</p><p></p><p>
