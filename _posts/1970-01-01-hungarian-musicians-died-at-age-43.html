(July 6, 1848		Pružina-May 9, 1892			Budapest)

	
		also known as Gabor Baross

	
was
a Hungarian
politician.


					</p><p>Baross was instrumental in the development of Hungary's railway system and contributed significantly towards the modernization of the country's infrastructure. He served as Minister of Trade and Transportation under Prime Minister Kálmán Tisza from 1886 until his death in 1892. During his time as minister, Baross implemented several reforms including the construction of new railway lines and the establishment of better communication and transport networks between cities. In addition to his work in politics, Baross was also a successful businessman and entrepreneur, having founded several significant companies in Hungary. He was a prominent figure in Hungarian society and his legacy is still evident today in the country's railway network and transportation infrastructure.</p><p>Baross was born in the small village of Pružina, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He began his career as an engineer before transitioning into politics in the early 1880s. As minister of Trade and Transportation, Baross was committed to expanding Hungary's economy by increasing trade and commerce. Under his leadership, Hungary's railway system expanded significantly, and the country became a hub for transportation in Central Europe.</p><p>In addition to his work in politics and business, Baross was also a passionate advocate for education. He firmly believed that a well-educated populace was essential for the growth and development of any society. As such, he established several schools across Hungary to promote literacy and access to education for all.</p><p>Baross's impact on Hungarian society was enormous, and he is still celebrated today as a hero of the country's history. His legacy lives on through the many institutions he helped establish, and his contributions to the modernization and development of Hungary continue to be felt to this day.</p><p>One of Baross's most significant achievements was the construction of the iconic Chain Bridge in Budapest, which opened in 1849, and was the first permanent bridge to span the Danube River, connecting the western and eastern parts of the city. The bridge, which was designed by the English engineer William Tierney Clark, quickly became a symbol of Hungary's power and modernization. Baross recognized the importance of the bridge in promoting commerce and communication between the two sides of the city, and championed its completion. He also oversaw the construction of several other key infrastructure projects in Hungary, including the expansion of the country's canal system and the development of a modern telegraph network.</p><p>Baross was also a prominent figure in Budapest's cultural scene and was a patron of the arts. He was a member of several prominent social and cultural organizations, including the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and donated generously to the city's museums and galleries. His commitment to the arts and culture was rooted in his belief that a vibrant cultural scene was essential for Hungary's national identity and pride.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Baross faced significant opposition from some quarters. Some criticized his close ties to the ruling elite and accused him of corruption. However, his supporters argued that his dedication to modernizing Hungary and improving the lives of ordinary people far outweighed his shortcomings.</p><p>Today, Baross's legacy continues to be celebrated in Hungary, with many streets, parks, and public places named after him. His contributions to the country's transportation network, infrastructure, and education system have made him one of the most important figures in the country's history.</p><p></p><p>

novelist and writer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his novels Journey by Moonlight and The Pendragon Legend, which were written in the 1930s. Szerb grew up in Budapest and earned his doctorate in German studies, going on to become a professor of literature. However, due to anti-Semitic laws introduced in Hungary, Szerb was dismissed from his academic positions and his books were banned. Szerb and his wife were both Jewish and were rounded up during the Holocaust, ultimately dying in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany in 1945. Despite his short life and tumultuous times he lived in, Szerb is remembered as one of Hungary's most prominent writers and remains influential in contemporary Hungarian literature.</p><p>In addition to his novels, Antal Szerb was also a prolific essayist, literary historian, and critic, and published several volumes of literary criticism throughout the 1930s. He was particularly interested in exploring the intersections of different national literatures and cultures, and wrote extensively on the relationships between Hungarian, German, and English literature. Szerb's work was deeply informed by his own experiences of living between different cultures and languages, and he was known for his complex and subtle portrayals of identity and belonging. Today, Szerb is recognized as a key figure in European literary modernism, and his work continues to attract new readers and critical attention.</p><p>Szerb was also a translator, fluent in German, English, Latin and Greek, and translated numerous literary works from German and English into Hungarian. He was a great admirer of several English and American writers, including Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and Henry James, and incorporated elements of their styles and themes into his own writing. Szerb also had a deep interest in Eastern spirituality and philosophy, and translated works by Indian and Chinese thinkers such as the Tao Te Ching and the Bhagavad Gita.</p><p>Szerb's most famous novel, Journey by Moonlight, is a surrealist exploration of identity, memory, and the search for meaning in a rapidly changing world. The Pendragon Legend, on the other hand, is a historical mystery set in medieval England, and touches on themes of power, religious conflict, and occultism. Today, Szerb is seen as an important influence on contemporary Hungarian literature, with his works still widely read and admired both in Hungary and abroad. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Szerb's life and work, with several new translations and adaptations bringing his works to a broader audience.</p><p></p><p>
