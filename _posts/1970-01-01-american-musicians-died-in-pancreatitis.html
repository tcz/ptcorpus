						Paul Pena was born into a Cape Verdean family in Hyannis, Massachusetts. He began playing music in his childhood, starting with the harmonica and later moving on to the guitar. In the 1970s, he gained a following in the San Francisco Bay Area music scene with his blend of rock, blues, pop, and psychedelic music. He released his first album, "New Train," in 1973, to critical acclaim.</p><p>In the late 1980s, Pena became interested in Tuvan throat singing, a style of music from the Republic of Tuva in southern Siberia that uses the human voice as an instrument. He taught himself the technique and eventually traveled to Tuva, where he studied with master throat singers and performed in festivals.</p><p>Pena's experiences in Tuva inspired him to write the song "Genghis Blues," which became the title track of his 1992 album. The song was also featured in a documentary of the same name, which chronicled Pena's journey to Tuva and showed his collaboration with a Tuvan throat singing group called Huun-Huur-Tu. The film won the Audience Award at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.</p><p>Throughout his career, Pena collaborated with a number of well-known musicians, including Bonnie Raitt and T-Bone Burnett. He continued to perform and record music until his death from complications of diabetes in 2005.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=838161" title="Wikipedia article about Paul Pena">Paul Pena on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/iranian-musicians-died-at-age-33.html' title='Iranian musicians died at age 33'><strong>Iranian musicians died at age 33</strong> List of the top 2 Iranian music stars who died when they were 33</a></li><li><a href='/bolivian-musicians-died-at-age-36.html' title='Bolivian musicians died at age 36'><strong>Bolivian musicians died at age 36</strong> List of the top 1 Bolivian music stars who died when they were 36</a></li><li><a href='/american-actresses-died-in-cerebral-hemorrhage.html' title='American actresses died in Cerebral hemorrhage'><strong>American actresses died in Cerebral hemorrhage</strong> List of the top 30 American actresses who died in Cerebral hemorrhage</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/south-korean-musicians-died-at-age-30.html' title='South Korean musicians died at age 30'><strong>South Korean musicians died at age 30</strong> List of the top 2 South Korean music stars who died when they were 30</a></li><li><a href='/afghan-musicians-died-at-age-36.html' title='Afghan musicians died at age 36'><strong>Afghan musicians died at age 36</strong> List of the top 1 Afghan music stars who died when they were 36</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actresses-died-in-septic-shock.html' title='Famous actresses died in Septic shock'><strong>Famous actresses died in Septic shock</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actresses who died in Septic shock</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
