Powell's musical career began when he was just 13 years old, playing in local bands in his hometown. He attended Oxford University and soon after formed The Unbelievable Truth with his brother, Andy Powell. The band gained popularity in the 1990s, and released three full-length albums before disbanding in 2000. In addition to his work as a musician, Powell has also produced records for other artists, including Frank Turner and Dive Dive. He has also worked as a television composer, writing the score for the British sitcom, The IT Crowd. Powell continues to perform, record, and produce music to this day.</p><p></p><p>
