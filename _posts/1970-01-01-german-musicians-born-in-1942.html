He went on to have a successful career, appearing in over 100 films and television shows, including "Berlin Alexanderplatz," "The Tin Drum," and "The Ogre."

However, John was equally at home in more subtle and introspective roles, such as his portrayal of Franz Bieberkopf in the acclaimed TV series "Berlin Alexanderplatz."

Over the years, he lent his voice to a wide range of German-language audiobooks, as well as dubbing foreign films and TV shows into German. His distinctive voice and talent for accents and dialects made him a sought-after voice actor in the industry.</p><p>Gottfried John's legacy as a cultural ambassador for Germany was also important to him. He worked tirelessly to promote German arts and culture, both at home and abroad, and was actively involved in programs that fostered cultural exchange and dialogue. In recognition of his contributions to German culture, he was awarded the Order of Merit of Berlin and the National Prize of East Germany.</p><p>Gottfried John's passing in 2014 was a great loss to the German entertainment industry, and he is widely remembered as one of its greatest talents. His impact on German cinema, television, and theatre will continue to be felt for years to come, and his legacy as a versatile and accomplished performer will inspire future generations of actors and artists.</p><p></p><p>
