									</h1><p>Here are 20 famous musicians from Argentina died before 35:</p><h2>Mariano Moreno</h2><p><strong>Mariano Moreno</strong>
(September 23, 1778		Buenos Aires-March 4, 1811)


was
an Argentine
lawyer, writer, journalist and politician.


					</p><p>He played a key role in the Argentine War of Independence against Spain and was one of the main ideologists behind the May Revolution of 1810, which marked the beginning of the Argentine War of Independence. Moreno was a strong advocate for democracy and human rights, and is remembered for his efforts to establish a republican form of government in Argentina. He founded the first national newspaper in Argentina, La Gazeta de Buenos Ayres, and also wrote a series of important documents and decrees, including the "Plan of Operation," which laid out his vision for the future of the country. Sadly, Moreno died young, at just 32 years old, and his contributions to Argentina's independence movement have been largely overshadowed by the legacy of other leaders, such as José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar. Despite this, Moreno is still celebrated as a hero and a symbol of the struggle for freedom and democracy in Argentina.</p><p>Moreno was born in a middle-class family and received his early education from Jesuits. He went on to study law at the Royal University of San Felipe in Santiago, Chile, where he was heavily influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment. After returning to Buenos Aires, he quickly became involved in politics and played a leading role in the May Revolution, which ousted the Spanish viceroy and established a provisional government. As Secretary of War and one of the leading members of the new government, Moreno pushed for radical reforms, including the abolition of slavery, the decentralization of power, and the establishment of a free press. </p><p>Moreno was also a prolific writer and produced a large body of work during his short life. In addition to founding La Gazeta de Buenos Ayres, he wrote numerous political tracts and letters that were instrumental in shaping public opinion during the early years of the independence movement. His most famous work is the "Representation of the Hacendados," which condemned the exploitation of rural workers and called for greater social equality. He also wrote a famous letter to his sister, in which he famously said "It is necessary to be free in order to be just, it is necessary to be just in order to be free."</p><p>Moreno's untimely death has been the subject of much speculation and controversy. Some historians believe that he was assassinated by his political enemies, while others argue that he died of natural causes. Despite the mystery surrounding his death, Moreno's legacy as a champion of democracy and human rights continues to inspire new generations of Argentines. In recognition of his contributions to Argentine independence, his portrait appears on the Argentine 5-peso bill.</p><p></p><p>
