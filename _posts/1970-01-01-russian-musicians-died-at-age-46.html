He was a key member of the Moscow Linguistic Circle, which included other influential literary scholars such as Viktor Shklovsky and Roman Jakobson. Medvedev's most celebrated work is his book "The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship," which introduced the concept of "defamiliarization," or "ostranenie," as a way of analyzing literary works. Tragically, Medvedev's life was cut short when he was arrested by Soviet authorities during the Stalinist purges, and he was ultimately executed. His legacy, however, lives on through his contributions to formalism and literary scholarship.</p><p></p><p>
