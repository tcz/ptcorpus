Goodricke studied the eclipsing binary star Algol and was able to deduce that its brightness was due to one star passing in front of the other. He also discovered the periodic nature of the star Delta Cephei, which led to the measurement of astronomical distances using a method known as the cosmic distance ladder. Although he died at the young age of 21, John Goodricke's contributions to astronomy helped lay the foundation for future discoveries in the field.</p><p>Goodricke was born into an affluent family and received a private education at home. As a child, he contracted scarlet fever, which left him deaf.

However, his legacy continues to inspire generations of astronomers who continue to build upon his work and make new discoveries in the field of variable stars. Today, Goodricke's name is remembered in several astronomical terms, including the Goodricke-Pigott Observatory and the Goodricke method for calculating the brightness of stars. Despite his short life, John Goodricke made a significant impact on astronomy and his contributions continue to shape our understanding of the universe.</p><p></p><p>
