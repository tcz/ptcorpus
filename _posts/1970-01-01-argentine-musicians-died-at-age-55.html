(September 24, 1886		Buenos Aires-July 15, 1942			Buenos Aires)

	
		also known as Roberto Maria Ortiz

	
was
an Argentine
lawyer and politician.


					</p><p>Ortiz served as the President of Argentina from 1938 to 1942. Prior to his presidency, he held several important government positions including serving as the Minister of Justice and Public Instruction, and as a member of the Buenos Aires city council. During his presidency, he focused on improving social welfare programs and infrastructure, and promoting economic growth through trade agreements with neighboring countries. Ortiz was also a supporter of the arts, and helped establish the National Symphony Orchestra of Argentina. Despite his successes, Ortiz's presidency was cut short due to his declining health, which ultimately led to his untimely death at the age of 55.</p><p>Ortiz was born into a wealthy family in Buenos Aires and received his law degree from the National University of Buenos Aires. He served as a lawyer and judge before entering politics. Ortiz was a member of the Radical Civic Union party and was known for his honesty and integrity. He was elected president in 1937 and took office the following year. </p><p>During his time as president, Ortiz worked to modernize the country's infrastructure, improving roads, railways, and ports. He also sought to improve working conditions for laborers and promoted public education. Ortiz's policies helped to stabilize the economy and improve living standards for many Argentines.</p><p>In addition to his political achievements, Ortiz was a noted art collector and helped to establish the National Fine Art Museum of Buenos Aires. He was also an avid horseman, and his passion for the sport led him to establish the Palermo racetrack in the city.</p><p>Ortiz's death was mourned by many in Argentina, and he is remembered as a leader who worked to improve the lives of his fellow citizens. His legacy continues to inspire generations of Argentines.</p><p>Ortiz's presidency was marked by challenges as well. During his term, Argentina remained neutral during World War II, despite pressure from both the Allied and Axis powers to choose a side. Ortiz's health problems also hindered his ability to govern, and he spent much of his time as president battling illness. His declining health led him to resign from office in 1942, only a few months before his death. Despite the challenges he faced, Ortiz remains a respected figure in Argentine history and is remembered for his commitment to social welfare, economic progress, and the arts.</p><p>Ortiz's presidency also coincided with a tumultuous time in Argentine politics. In 1943, a military coup overthrew the government and installed a nationalist government. This coup was largely driven by tensions within the military over Argentina's neutral stance during World War II and concerns over the influence of the United States in Argentine affairs. Despite Ortiz's attempts to improve relations with other countries, the nationalist government that followed his presidency would prove hostile to foreign economic interests and would pursue a policy of economic isolationism.</p><p>Ortiz's contributions to Argentine society, however, were not forgotten. Today, he is remembered as a statesman who sought to improve the lives of ordinary Argentines through economic and social reforms. His legacy can be seen in the modernization of the country's infrastructure, improvements to labor conditions, and his support for the arts. Ortiz's presidency marked a turning point in Argentine history, and his contributions to the country continue to be celebrated to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(September 13, 1896		Lerín-May 26, 1952			Arlington)


was
an Argentine
personality.


					</p><p>Amado Alonso was a prominent Argentine linguist, philologist, and literary critic. He is considered one of the most important figures in the field of Hispanic linguistics and is particularly known for his work on the syntax of Spanish. Alonso received his doctorate in Romance philology in Argentina and later went on to study at the University of Madrid in Spain. He was a professor at several universities in Argentina and Spain, including the University of Buenos Aires and the University of Madrid, and was a member of the Argentine Academy of Letters. Alonso published numerous works on language and literature, including a famous study on the language of Cervantes. He was a vocal opponent of fascism and was exiled to the United States during the Spanish Civil War. Alonso continued his scholarship in the United States, teaching at universities such as Columbia University and publishing works on Spanish literature and linguistics until his death in 1952.</p><p>Some of Amado Alonso's most significant contributions to the field of Hispanic linguistics include his research on the concept of syntactic movement and his study of the Spanish language's evolution throughout history. Alonso also famously criticized the traditional views on Spanish grammar and syntax, promoting an approach based on the history and usage of the language rather than on grammatical rules. Besides his academic career, Alonso was also a champion of the democratic ideals of education and culture. He believed in the importance of language and literature in the formation of a nation's identity, and he actively advocated for education reforms in Argentina during his tenure at the University of Buenos Aires. Amado Alonso was also an accomplished translator, having translated several important works of literature from German, Italian, and English into Spanish, among them, Shakespeare's plays, Goethe's Faust, and Dante's Divine Comedy. His legacy continues to inspire scholars of linguistics and literature in the Spanish-speaking world to this day.</p><p>Amado Alonso’s groundbreaking contributions to Hispanic linguistics and literary criticism have had a significant impact on the field, inspiring generations of scholars to approach the Spanish language and its literature with a renewed sense of understanding and appreciation. His work helped pave the way for a more interdisciplinary and nuanced approach to the study of language, culture, and literature, emphasizing the essential role of context and history in understanding linguistic and literary phenomena.</p><p>In addition to his scholarly achievements, Alonso was also highly regarded as a pedagogue and mentor, establishing long-lasting relationships with many of his students who went on to become prominent figures in their own right. His legacy as an educator continues to inspire new generations of scholars who seek to follow in his path, promoting a more inclusive, multidisciplinary, and participatory approach to the study of language, literature, and culture.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced in life, including political persecution and exile, Alonso's commitment to the values of democracy, education, and culture never faltered. His life and work demonstrate the power of knowledge and learning to transform individuals and societies, inspiring us to think critically, empathetically, and creatively about the world around us.</p><p>Amado Alonso was born in Lerín, a small town in Navarre, Spain but grew up in Argentina, where his family had emigrated when he was five years old. During his childhood, he showed a passion for literature and languages, which led him to study Romance philology at the University of Buenos Aires. Alonso was a brilliant and dedicated student, and his academic achievements earned him a scholarship to continue his studies in Europe. </p><p>In 1920, Alonso traveled to Spain, where he attended the University of Madrid and worked closely with renowned linguists and literary critics, including Ramón Menéndez Pidal, the founder of modern Hispanic philology. Alonso's experience in Spain had a profound impact on his intellectual development and shaped his approach to language and literature. He became interested in the historical and cultural factors that shape linguistic phenomena and criticized the prescriptive approach to language that dominated Spanish grammar and syntax textbooks at the time.</p><p>After completing his doctorate in 1925, Alonso returned to Argentina, where he taught at the University of Buenos Aires and established himself as a leading scholar in the field of Hispanic linguistics. He published numerous articles and books on the history, structure, and usage of the Spanish language, which challenged the prevailing views on grammar and syntax and emphasized the importance of context and usage in understanding linguistic phenomena.</p><p>Alonso's scholarly achievements earned him international recognition, and he was invited to teach at several universities in Europe and the United States. However, his involvement in left-wing politics and his opposition to the fascist regime of General Francisco Franco in Spain made him a target of repression. In 1936, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Alonso was forced to flee to Argentina, where he continued his scholarship and teaching.</p><p>Alonso's exile marked a turning point in his intellectual trajectory, prompting him to engage with a broader range of issues, including education, culture, and human rights. He became increasingly involved in the democratic and cultural movements of his time, participating in debates, conferences, and other public activities aimed at promoting a more inclusive and pluralistic vision of Argentine society.</p><p>Despite his health problems, Alonso continued to work tirelessly until his untimely death in 1952. He left behind a rich legacy of scholarship, pedagogy, and political activism that continues to inspire scholars, artists, and activists in the Hispanic world and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
