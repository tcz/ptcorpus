His attempt to fly from the Galata Tower was a daring and innovative feat that captured the imagination of people at the time. Despite the success of his gliding attempt, he faced criticism from the Ottoman authorities who saw his experiment as heretical and blasphemous.</p><p>In addition to his attempts at human flight, Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi made significant contributions to scientific fields including astronomy, mathematics, and engineering. He worked as an astronomer in the Ottoman court and was responsible for developing a new calendar that was used for several centuries. He also designed and built various machines, including water pumps and mechanical clocks, that were used in the Ottoman Empire.</p><p>While much of Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi's life remains shrouded in mystery, his contributions to science and his pioneering attempt at human flight have secured his place as one of Turkey's most celebrated figures.</p><p></p><p>
