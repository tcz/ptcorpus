Hikmet was also a champion of workers' rights and helped establish the Pancyprian Federation of Labour, which remains an influential trade union in Cyprus to this day. Despite his many contributions to Cypriot society, Hikmet's life was tragically cut short when he was assassinated at the age of 47. His legacy lives on, however, through the continued efforts of those who seek to honor his memory and carry on his legacy of dedication to the cause of Cypriot independence.</p><p></p><p>
