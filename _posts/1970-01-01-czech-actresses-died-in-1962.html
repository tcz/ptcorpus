							Marwille initially worked as a screenwriter before moving into acting. She appeared in several films during the 1920s and 30s, including "The Girl from Carqueville" and "František Langer's Devilish Pit". In addition to her work in film, Marwille was also active in the theater, both as an actor and a playwright. She wrote several plays, including "The Night Before the Wedding" and "Princess Imma". </p><p>Marwille was known for her versatility and ability to play a wide range of roles. She often portrayed strong, independent women in her films, a reflection of her own feminist beliefs. Despite her success, however, Marwille's career was cut short by the rise of fascism in Czechoslovakia. She was forced to flee the country in 1938 and ultimately settled in the United States. </p><p>In the US, Marwille continued to work in the arts, but struggled to make the same impact that she had in Czechoslovakia. She appeared in several small roles in Hollywood films and continued to write plays, but her work received little recognition. Marwille returned to Czechoslovakia in the late 1950s, where she lived out the remainder of her life. Today, she is remembered as a pioneering figure in Czech cinema, both for her acting and her writing.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=30594338" title="Wikipedia article about Suzanne Marwille">Suzanne Marwille on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-explosion.html' title='Famous actors died in Explosion'><strong>Famous actors died in Explosion</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actors who died in Explosion</a></li><li><a href='/australian-actresses-died-in-1965.html' title='Australian actresses died in 1965'><strong>Australian actresses died in 1965</strong> List of the top 1 Australian actresses who died in 1965</a></li><li><a href='/turkish-actresses-born-in-1949.html' title='Turkish actresses born in 1949'><strong>Turkish actresses born in 1949</strong> List of the top 7 Turkish actresses who were born in 1949</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/polish-musicians-died-at-age-29.html' title='Polish musicians died at age 29'><strong>Polish musicians died at age 29</strong> List of the top 3 Polish music stars who died when they were 29</a></li><li><a href='/english-actresses-born-in-1905.html' title='English actresses born in 1905'><strong>English actresses born in 1905</strong> List of the top 6 English actresses who were born in 1905</a></li><li><a href='/croatian-actresses-born-in-1977.html' title='Croatian actresses born in 1977'><strong>Croatian actresses born in 1977</strong> List of the top 6 Croatian actresses who were born in 1977</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
