was
a Cypriot
personality.


					</p><p>He was a well-known journalist and writer, as well as a political figure who played a significant role in the struggle for Cyprus' independence from British rule. Önder was one of the founders of the Cypriot newspaper "Halkın Sesi" (Voice of the People) and also served as an editor for "Cumhuriyet" (The Republic) newspaper. In addition to his journalism career, Önder was involved in politics, serving as a member of the Turkish Resistance Organization during the Cyprus Emergency between 1955-1959. He was also a member of the Turkish Cypriot community's delegation during the infamous Zurich-London agreements in 1959, which established the Republic of Cyprus. Despite his contributions to Cypriot society, Önder's life was cut short when he was assassinated by a Greek Cypriot nationalist on May 24, 1958.</p><p>Önder was born to a Turkish Cypriot family in Kaimakli, a suburb of Nicosia, Cyprus. He spent his early years in poverty and had to work as a laborer to support his family. Despite the challenges he faced, Önder was determined to educate himself and became interested in politics and journalism at a young age. In 1948, he joined the underground communist party and began writing for leftist newspapers.</p><p>As a journalist, Önder was known for his bold and critical writing, which often exposed corruption and injustice in Cypriot society. His work earned him the respect of his peers and the admiration of many readers. However, his political views also made him a target for government officials and right-wing nationalists, who saw him as a threat to their authority.</p><p>Önder's involvement in the Turkish Resistance Organization and his participation in the Zurich-London agreements made him a prominent figure in the fight for Cypriot independence. He believed that Cyprus should be governed by its own people, free from foreign influence or intervention. However, his aspirations for a united Cyprus were cut short by his assassination at the age of 57.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Fazıl Önder remains a beloved and respected figure in Cypriot history, remembered for his dedication to journalism, politics, and the struggle for independence.</p><p>Önder's legacy continues to inspire many activists and journalists in Cyprus today. In his honor, the Turkish Cypriot Journalists Association has established the "Fazıl Önder Journalism Prize" to recognize outstanding investigative journalism that exposes corruption and injustice in Cypriot society. Önder's work also inspired younger generations of Cypriot journalists, such as Sevgül Uludağ, who founded the first Turkish Cypriot online news agency, TAK, in 2005. In addition to his journalism and political activism, Önder was also an accomplished writer, with several short stories and novels to his name. His best-known work, "Levent", was published in 1957 and tells the story of a young man's struggle against poverty and injustice in Cyprus. Today, Önder's legacy continues to be celebrated and his contributions to Cypriot society are recognized as invaluable in the country's struggle for independence and freedom.</p><p></p><p>
