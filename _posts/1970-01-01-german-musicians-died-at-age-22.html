(January 31, 1921		Charlottenburg-August 5, 1943)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Eva-Maria Buch was an anti-Nazi resistance fighter during World War II. She was a member of the White Rose, a non-violent group of students and professors who spoke out against the government and distributed leaflets urging Germans to resist the regime. Buch conducted intelligence work, gathered information and maintained contacts with other resistance groups. Sadly, she was eventually captured by the Gestapo, tortured and sentenced to death by hanging at the age of 22. Today, she is remembered as a courageous symbol of resistance against Nazi oppression.</p><p>Eva-Maria Buch was born into a family of artists and intellectuals in Charlottenburg, Germany in 1921. Her father, Hans Buch, was a renowned Berlin sculptor and her mother, Anna, was a pianist. From an early age, Eva-Maria showed a keen interest in literature, philosophy, and politics. She became involved in left-wing circles and joined the Socialist Workers' Party in 1939.</p><p>Following the outbreak of World War II, Eva-Maria became increasingly disillusioned with the Nazi regime and began looking for ways to resist their oppressive policies. She was introduced to the White Rose group by a friend and quickly became an active member. The group published six different leaflets during 1942 and 1943, calling for Germans to rise up against the government and join the resistance.</p><p>Eva-Maria played a vital role in the group's activities, helping to draft and distribute their leaflets, and maintaining contact with other anti-Nazi groups. She knew the risks involved in her actions but was motivated by her deep commitment to social justice and human rights.</p><p>Despite her efforts to remain anonymous, Eva-Maria was eventually caught by the Gestapo in 1943. She was arrested, tortured, and sentenced to death by hanging. The night before her execution, she wrote a letter to her parents, in which she expressed her love for them and her hope for a better world.</p><p>Today, Eva-Maria Buch is recognized as a hero of the German resistance and a symbol of hope for those who stand up against oppression and injustice. Her life and legacy continue to inspire others to speak out against tyranny and fight for the greater good.</p><p>Eva-Maria Buch's legacy continued to inspire people long after her death. She was posthumously awarded the Cross of Honor for Outstanding Civilian Courage in 1961, and in 2003, a street in Berlin was named after her. In 2005, a memorial plaque was unveiled in her honor in front of the house where she lived in Berlin.</p><p>Her story inspired several books and films, including the 1982 film "Die Wei√üe Rose" ("The White Rose"), which tells the story of the group's activities and their tragic fate. Her life is also commemorated in several museums and exhibitions throughout Germany.</p><p>Eva-Maria Buch's courage and sacrifice serve as a reminder of the importance of standing up for what is right, even in the face of great danger. Her legacy continues to inspire people to fight against injustice and oppression, and to strive for a better, more just world.</p><p></p><p>

(October 7, 1923		Feldberger Seenlandschaft-December 13, 1945			Hamelin)


was
a German
politician.


					</p><p>This is incorrect. Irma Grese was actually a female SS guard at the Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps during the Holocaust. She was known for her cruelty towards prisoners, often beating and torturing them. She was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Belsen trial, and was subsequently sentenced to death by hanging on December 13, 1945. At only 22 years old, she was one of the youngest Nazis to be executed for her crimes.</p><p>Irma Grese was born in Feldberger Seenlandschaft, in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. She was the third of five children, and her family was impoverished. Despite her limited education, Irma was drawn to the Nazi Party and became a member of the League of German Girls at the age of 15. In 1942, she volunteered to work at a concentration camp, and was assigned to Auschwitz.</p><p>Irma quickly rose through the ranks and became a senior SS supervisor of female prisoners at the camp. She was notorious for her brutality, and was known for selecting prisoners for the gas chambers and personally carrying out executions. In 1944, she was transferred to Bergen-Belsen, where she continued to engage in sadistic behavior.</p><p>After the war, Irma was captured and charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. During her trial, witnesses recounted the atrocities she committed at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. Despite her attempts to deny responsibility, she was found guilty and sentenced to death.</p><p>Irma's execution was met with little sympathy, and many saw it as a fitting punishment for her heinous crimes. Today, she is remembered as a symbol of the ruthlessness of the Nazi regime, and her story continues to serve as a reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust.</p><p>Irma Grese's trial was part of the larger Belsen Trial, which took place in November-December 1945. The trial was conducted by a British military court, and Grese was one of 45 defendants. During the trial, survivors of the concentration camp testified about Grese's atrocities, including her habit of using her whip to beat prisoners to death. Grese's defense counsel argued that she was simply following orders and was not responsible for the crimes she committed. Nevertheless, she was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging.</p><p>Irma Grese's youth and gender made her a particularly intriguing figure of the Nazi regime. She was just a teenager when she joined the League of German Girls, and her sadism towards prisoners at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen was shocking even by the standards of the SS. In addition to her physical violence, Grese was known for her cruelty in selecting prisoners for the gas chambers, and for forcing others to do the same.</p><p>Today, Grese is sometimes referred to as the "Beautiful Beast" due to her striking looks and monstrous actions. Her crimes continue to be studied and debated by historians and scholars, who seek to understand how an ordinary young woman could be transformed into a vicious Nazi executioner.</p><p></p><p>
						She died caused by hanging.
