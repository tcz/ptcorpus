(January 26, 1898		Riga-February 21, 1951			Łódź)


was
a Polish
personality.


					</p><p>She was a sculptor, theoretician of art, and a pioneer of Constructivism in Poland. Katarzyna Kobro was born in Riga, then a part of the Russian Empire, and grew up in Moscow. She moved to Poland in 1922 and became involved in the avant-garde artistic circles in Warsaw. Kobro's sculptures were characterized by geometric forms and precise lines, and she was interested in creating works that explored spatial relationships. Along with her partner Władysław Strzemiński, she founded the progressive art group a.r. (a.r. stands for Blok Reklamy, which means Advertising Block in English). Despite financial difficulties and increasing political repression, Kobro remained dedicated to her art until her death in 1951. Her legacy continues to inspire contemporary artists and theorists today.</p><p>Kobro studied under the famous sculpture Antoine Bourdelle in Paris from 1924 to 1926. During this time, she developed a deep interest in Constructivist art, which had just begun to emerge in Europe. In 1926, she returned to Poland and became one of the country's leading figures in the field. Kobro was also involved with the Soviet Union's Constructivist movement, and her work was exhibited in Moscow's first Constructivist exhibition in 1922.</p><p>Kobro's work combined a commitment to the principles of Constructivism with a distinctly Polish sensibility. Her sculptures, which included works made of metal, wood, and other materials, explored the relationships between forms and the spaces around them. She was particularly interested in exploring the ways in which light interacts with sculptural forms.</p><p>Throughout the 1930s, Kobro and Strzemiński became increasingly involved in the political and social struggles of the time. They were both members of the Communist Party of Poland, and their art was closely tied to their political beliefs. They saw art as a means of promoting social change and believed that it should be accessible to everyone.</p><p>Despite being marginalized by the increasingly conservative political climate in Poland in the post-World War II period, Kobro continued to work until her death. Her work was rediscovered in the 1960s, and she is now recognized as one of Poland's most important avant-garde artists.</p><p></p><p>

(December 24, 1688		Rawicz-June 1, 1742			Nesvizh)


was
a Polish
physician and writer.


					</p><p>Bachstrom was born to a Swedish father and Polish mother in Rawicz, Poland. He attended the University of Leiden to study medicine and received his degree in 1715. After practicing medicine in Amsterdam and London, Bachstrom returned to Poland where he worked as a physician to various noble families. </p><p>Aside from his medical expertise, Bachstrom was also an accomplished writer and poet. He published several works in Latin and Polish on topics ranging from medicine to philosophy to politics. His most notable work is the "Historia therapiae passionis," a medical treatise on the treatment of syphilis. Bachstrom was also a member of several scholarly societies and contributed to scientific journals throughout his career.</p><p>Bachstrom died on June 1, 1742, in Nesvizh, Poland. Despite his contributions to medicine and literature, he is not widely known outside of scholarly circles.</p><p>However, Bachstrom's impact on the field of medicine cannot be understated. He was an advocate for using empirical evidence in medical treatments and was one of the first physicians to use physical examinations to diagnose illnesses. Bachstrom's writings also reflect his views on the importance of preventive medicine, particularly in the area of public health. His work on syphilis was particularly important, as the disease was rampant in Europe during his time and there were few effective treatments available. Bachstrom's contributions helped pave the way for the development of modern medical practices. He was also known for his philanthropic efforts, using his medical knowledge to help those less fortunate.</p><p></p><p>
