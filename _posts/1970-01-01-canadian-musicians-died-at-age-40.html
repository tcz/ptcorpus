(December 28, 1929		Winnipeg-May 31, 1970			New York City)


was
a Canadian
ice hockey player.


					</p><p>During his career as a goaltender, Sawchuk played for several different teams, including the Detroit Red Wings, the Toronto Maple Leafs, and the Boston Bruins. He was known for his exceptional skill and toughness, and he set several records over the course of his career. Sawchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1971, and his legacy as one of the greatest goaltenders of all time continues to be celebrated by hockey fans worldwide. Despite his success on the ice, Sawchuk struggled with alcoholism and depression throughout his life, and his untimely death at the age of 40 was a tragic loss for the hockey community.</p><p>Sawchuk grew up in Winnipeg, Canada, and began playing organized hockey in his teenage years. He was discovered by a Detroit Red Wings scout while playing in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League and eventually signed with the team in 1947. Sawchuk made an immediate impact in the NHL and helped lead the Red Wings to their first Stanley Cup championship in 1950.</p><p>Throughout his career, Sawchuk was known for his acrobatic saves and fearless style of play. He was a four-time Vezina Trophy winner, awarded to the league's top goaltender, and was named to the NHL All-Star Team six times. Sawchuk also set numerous records, including the most shutouts in a single season (12) and the most shutouts in a career (103) at the time of his retirement.</p><p>Off the ice, Sawchuk struggled with personal demons. He battled alcoholism and had a contentious relationship with his teammates and coaches. Sawchuk's tragic death at the age of 40 was the result of an injury sustained during a recreational hockey game in New York City. Despite his challenges, Sawchuk's legacy as a pioneering goaltender and one of the NHL's all-time greats endures, and he remains an inspiration to aspiring hockey players around the world.</p><p>After his retirement from playing professional hockey, Sawchuk became a coach for various minor league teams, including the Pittsburgh Penguins' farm club. He also briefly served as the head coach of the New York Rangers in the 1969-1970 season, just before his untimely death. Sawchuk was posthumously honored with the Lester Patrick Trophy in 1971, which recognizes outstanding contributions to ice hockey in the United States. In addition, the NHL created the Terry Sawchuk Award in his honor, which is awarded annually to the top goaltender in the Western Hockey League. Sawchuk's legacy extends beyond the ice, as he is also the subject of several biographies, including Night Work: The Sawchuk Poems by Randall Maggs, which explores Sawchuk's life and legacy through poetry. His life has been dramatized in the movie "Goalie".</p><p></p><p>

He wrestled for a number of different promotions, including Stampede Wrestling, New Japan Pro Wrestling, and World Championship Wrestling.</p><p>In 2000, Benoit signed with the WWE and achieved some of his greatest successes there. He won the World Heavyweight Championship, the Intercontinental Championship, and the Tag Team Championship multiple times, and was widely regarded as one of the top wrestlers of his generation.</p><p>However, Benoit's career and life came to a tragic end in 2007 when he murdered his wife Nancy and their young son before taking his own life. The incident shocked the wrestling world and raised questions about the physical and mental toll of the sport on its performers. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the WWE instituted a number of changes to improve the health and safety of its wrestlers.</p><p>Benoit's wrestling style was known for his technical prowess, using a wide range of submission holds and suplexes to take down his opponents. He was also known for his intensity and commitment to his craft, often pushing himself to the limits in the ring. Outside of wrestling, Benoit was described as a quiet and private person who kept to himself.</p><p>Following Benoit's death, an investigation was launched into the tragedy. It was discovered that he had been suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain condition caused by repeated head trauma. This led to speculation that Benoit's years of wrestling had contributed to his violent actions.</p><p>Despite the tragic end to Benoit's life, his contributions to the wrestling world are still celebrated by many fans. He was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2020, with the organization acknowledging his accomplishments in the ring while also recognizing the tragic nature of his death.</p><p>In addition to his wrestling career, Chris Benoit was also an accomplished amateur wrestler, winning two national championships in Canada and representing his country at the 1985 Junior World Championships. He initially pursued a career in football before turning to wrestling, but his passion for the sport ultimately led him down a different path. In interviews, Benoit credited his father, a wrestling promoter, for introducing him to the sport and encouraging him to pursue it.</p><p>Benoit's legacy in the wrestling world is complex, as his actions in the final days of his life have cast a shadow over his many accomplishments in the ring. Some fans and fellow wrestlers choose to focus solely on his contributions to the sport, while others acknowledge the tragedy of his final days and the need for greater attention to the health and safety of wrestlers. Regardless of one's opinion of Benoit, his impact on wrestling is undeniable, and his technical skill and intensity continue to inspire wrestlers to this day.</p><p></p><p>
