						</p><p>Rita Comisi (August 16, 1985-) is an Italian politician who currently serves as a member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. She has represented the Sicilian constituency of Agrigento since March 2018, when she was elected as a member of the Five Star Movement. Prior to her political career, Comisi worked as a pharmacist and was active in grassroots politics as a member of the Five Star Movement. She has been recognized for her work on healthcare policy and her advocacy for greater transparency in government. Comisi is a graduate of the University of Catania, where she earned a degree in pharmacy. In addition to her work in Parliament, she is also a member of the parliamentary commission on healthcare policy.</p><p>Comisi was born in Catania, Sicily and grew up in a politically engaged family. Her father was a member of the Communist Party and her mother was active in feminist and environmental movements. Comisi joined the Five Star Movement in 2013, drawn to the party's anti-establishment stance and its focus on transparency and direct democracy. She quickly became involved in local politics, organizing public rallies and participating in online and offline discussions on issues such as healthcare, environmental protection, and public education. </p><p>In Parliament, Comisi has been a vocal advocate for increasing public investment in healthcare and promoting preventive care measures. She has also worked to promote the use of digital technologies in healthcare, advocating for the development of eHealth and mHealth programs to improve access and quality of care. As a member of the parliamentary commission on healthcare policy, she has called for greater collaboration between the public and private sectors to address the challenges facing the Italian healthcare system. </p><p>Outside of politics, Comisi is an avid runner and has participated in several marathons and half-marathons. She also enjoys hiking, reading, and spending time with her family and friends.</p><p>Comisi's dedication to public service began before her election to Parliament. In 2015, she ran for mayor of her hometown, Canicattì, but was not successful in her bid. However, she used the experience to further her understanding of local politics and to build connections in the community. She has also been involved in various social and environmental initiatives, such as promoting sustainable transportation through bike sharing programs and advocating for stricter regulations on plastic waste. Comisi is considered a rising star in Italian politics, particularly within the Five Star Movement, and is seen as a potential future leader of the party. Her reputation as a competent and dedicated lawmaker has earned her respect from members of all political parties, and her commitment to transparency and accountability has won her praise from civil society groups and activists.</p><p>As a member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, Rita Comisi has been active in advocating for greater rights and protections for women, particularly in cases of domestic and gender-based violence. She has called for stronger laws and enforcement mechanisms to address these issues, and has spoken out against the prevalence of sexism and misogyny in Italian society. Comisi has also been a vocal proponent of environmental protections, and has called for greater investment in renewable energy and the development of sustainable business practices. Her political platform emphasizes the importance of social justice, equality, and the protection of human rights, and she has been recognized for her work in promoting these values.</p><p>Comisi's work on healthcare policy has also extended to mental health, where she has advocated for increased investment and resources to address the growing mental health crisis in Italy. She has highlighted the need for early intervention and support for those struggling with mental health issues, particularly young people, and has worked to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. Comisi has also been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, calling for greater legal protections and social acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. Her strong advocacy and progressive stance on social and environmental issues has earned her a sizable following and support among younger voters, particularly those disillusioned with traditional political parties.</p><p>In recognition of her work, Comisi has received several awards and honors, including being named one of the "40 under 40" young leaders in Italian politics by Il Foglio in 2019. She has also been invited to speak at numerous international conferences, where she has shared her perspective on issues such as healthcare policy, social justice, and environmental sustainability. Comisi's rise in Italian politics has been seen as a positive sign for the country's political future, as she represents a new generation of leaders focused on transparency, accountability, and the well-being of all citizens.</p><p></p><p>
