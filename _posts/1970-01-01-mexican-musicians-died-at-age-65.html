(June 7, 1883		Chester-September 2, 1948			Santa Fe)

	
		a.k.a. Sylvanus Griswold Morley

	
was
a Mexican
archaeologist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his extensive research and contributions to Mayan archaeology. Morley studied at Harvard University and worked as the assistant curator of South American Archaeology at the Peabody Museum before joining the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Division of Historical Research in 1912. </p><p>Morley's excavations and research of the Mayan civilization led to many groundbreaking discoveries and publications, including the identification of numerous Mayan cities and deciphering the Mayan calendar. His work also played a vital role in debunking the myth that the Mayans were a lost civilization. </p><p>In addition to his archaeological work, Morley was actively involved in conservation efforts, specifically the preservation of the Spanish colonial city of Antigua Guatemala. He received numerous honors and awards for his contributions to archaeology and conservation, including being appointed as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1940.</p><p>Morley's passion for archaeology stemmed from his childhood fascination with the ruins of the Roman forts near his home in England. He followed his passion to North America, where he began working as a field archaeologist in Arizona and New Mexico. However, it was his first trip to the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza in 1910 that inspired him to dedicate his life to studying the Mayan civilization.</p><p>Morley's work in Mayan archaeology was not limited to fieldwork and research; he also played a prominent role in organizing and overseeing the restoration and conservation of numerous Mayan sites. He worked tirelessly to promote the scientific and cultural value of ancient ruins and to create policies to protect them from looting and destruction.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to archaeology and conservation, Morley was a member of the U.S. Army's intelligence service during World War I and served as an advisor to the U.S. Office of Strategic Services during World War II. He was also an accomplished writer, publishing numerous scholarly works in addition to his travel and adventure writing.</p><p>Today, Morley is remembered as one of the foremost experts on the Mayan civilization and a pioneer in the field of archaeology. His legacy lives on through his extensive publications, the conservation efforts he helped to pioneer, and the ongoing study and exploration of the Mayan civilization.</p><p>Morley was deeply committed to preserving the cultural heritage of the indigenous people of Central America. He recognized the importance of documenting and interpreting Mayan ruins as a way to understand their historical significance and to appreciate their beauty. Morley was also a vocal advocate for the rights of the Mayan people and worked to promote the study of their language and culture.</p><p>Morley's contributions to archaeology were not without controversy, as his theories on the collapse of the Mayan civilization were criticized by some scholars. However, his dedication and contributions to the field of Mayan archaeology cannot be denied and he paved the way for future researchers to continue exploring and discovering the rich history of the Mayan civilization.</p><p>Today, Morley's legacy is celebrated through numerous exhibits at museums and universities around the world. The Morley Collection, which includes over 9,000 photographs, drawings, and artifacts from Morley's work in Central America, is housed at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.</p><p></p><p>

(October 13, 1947		Chihuahua-June 8, 2013			New York City)


was
a Mexican
graphic designer and art director.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work designing the iconic logo of the punk rock band, the Ramones. Vega moved to the United States in 1971 and began working as a freelance designer. In 1974, he met the Ramones and went on to serve as their creative director for over 22 years, designing album artwork, merchandise, and stage sets for the band. Vega was also a avid collector of punk rock memorabilia, including rare records, posters and concert tickets. He passed away in 2013 at the age of 65.</p><p>Aside from his work with the Ramones, Arturo Vega also designed album covers for other bands such as the Voidoids and the Remains. He was a key figure in the New York City punk rock scene, often hosting parties and events at his loft in the East Village. Vega was also known for his painting and sculpture work, which he exhibited in galleries across the city. In addition to his creative pursuits, he was an advocate for the arts and served on the board of directors for the Anthology Film Archives. Vega's legacy as a designer and cultural icon continues to inspire artists and musicians around the world.</p><p>Vega was born in northern Mexico and spent his childhood in Chihuahua before moving to California with his family at the age of 10. He attended Chouinard Art Institute (now the California Institute of the Arts) in Los Angeles and later moved to New York City in the early 1970s. Vega's interest in the punk rock scene was sparked by a chance encounter with the band Television at CBGB, a legendary punk club in Manhattan's Bowery neighborhood. He went on to become a fixture of the punk and new wave scenes, designing album covers and posters for bands such as Blondie, the Talking Heads, and The Velvet Underground.</p><p>Vega was known for his close collaboration with the Ramones, and his designs played a key role in shaping the band's image and aesthetic. He created the Ramones' distinctive logo, which featured the band's name in bold, block letters and became one of the most recognizable symbols of punk rock. Vega was also responsible for the design of the band's album covers, including their debut album, "Ramones," which featured a photograph of the band in front of a brick wall, and "Road to Ruin," which showed the band members with cartoon heads.</p><p>In addition to his work with the Ramones, Vega ran his own graphic design studio, which specialized in branding and packaging for clients in the music, fashion, and art worlds. He was widely recognized for his innovative, boundary-pushing designs and his commitment to supporting emerging artists and designers. Vega remained active in the New York City arts scene until his death in 2013, and his impact on the worlds of graphic design and punk rock continues to be felt today.</p><p></p><p>
