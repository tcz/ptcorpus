					</p><p>Robert Heaton was an English musician, best known as the drummer for the British Indie rock band, The Beautiful South. He was born on July 6, 1961, in Knutsford, Cheshire, England. Heaton started playing drums when he was in secondary school and later joined various local bands. </p><p>In 1988, Heaton co-founded The Beautiful South along with Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway, both of whom he knew from a previous band, The Housemartins. He contributed to the band's success as a songwriter, writing several of their hits such as "Old Red Eyes Is Back," "36D," and "A Little Time."</p><p>Apart from his work with The Beautiful South, Heaton also released a solo album, "Realms of Gold" in 2001. Unfortunately, Heaton's health had been deteriorating due to pancreatic cancer, and he was unable to promote the album as he spent most of his time in the hospital. </p><p>Robert Heaton passed away on November 4, 2004, at the age of 43, and was mourned by fans and fellow musicians alike. He is remembered as a talented and influential musician who helped shape the British Indie rock scene.</p><p>Heaton's legacy in the music industry spans beyond just his drumming and songwriting abilities. He was known for his fun-loving and vibrant personality offstage, which made him a beloved figure among fans and colleagues. In fact, Heaton's positive attitude and humor remained with him until the very end, with him even recording drum tracks for The Beautiful South's final album, "Superbi," from his hospital bed. After his passing, The Beautiful South dedicated their 2006 compilation album "Soup" to Heaton's memory. He is survived by his wife and two children.</p><p>In addition to his musical career, Robert Heaton was interested in various other creative pursuits. He was an avid photographer and had studied art history in college. He had also designed the cover art for The Beautiful South's album, "Blue Is the Colour." He had a unique approach to songwriting, often drawing inspiration from social issues and political themes. He was also known for his expertise in drumming and was highly respected among fellow musicians. Many artists, including Ed Sheeran and Jools Holland, have cited him as an influence on their own music. In recognition of his contributions to the British music scene, an annual music festival called the Robert Heaton Memorial Festival was established in his hometown of Knutsford. The festival features a lineup of local music talent and serves as a tribute to his legacy.</p><p></p><p>
