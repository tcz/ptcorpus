a Haitian
politician.


					</p><p>Jean-Claude Duvalier succeeded his father, François "Papa Doc" Duvalier, as the President of Haiti at the young age of 19. He ruled Haiti for 15 years, from 1971 until his ousting in 1986. During his presidency, Haiti experienced both political oppression and economic decline, with widespread corruption and human rights abuses. Duvalier's regime was notorious for its use of violence and torture to suppress opposition. In 1986, after growing pressure from the international community and a popular uprising, Duvalier fled Haiti for exile in France. He remained in exile for almost 25 years, returning to Haiti in 2011 to face corruption charges. Despite facing ongoing protests, Duvalier never faced trial for his crimes during his time as president, and his death in 2014 marked the end of a controversial era in Haiti's history.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in myocardial infarction.
