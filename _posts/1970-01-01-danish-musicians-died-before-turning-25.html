(December 4, 1867		Flensburg-July 20, 1889			Tåsinge)


was
a Danish
personality.


					</p><p>Elvira Madigan was actually born Hedvig Antoinette Isabella Eleonore Jensen. When she was only 16 years old, she ran away with a Swedish nobleman and circus performer named Sixten Sparre, who was 21 years her senior and married with children. The couple escaped to the countryside of Denmark, where they lived together in secrecy for several years, often performing together in Sparre's circus.</p><p>Their tragic love story became known as "The Ballad of Elvira Madigan," as it was immortalized in poems, songs, and even films. However, as Sparre's money and resources began to dwindle, the couple fell into financial distress. In July of 1889, Sparre shot Elvira in the head and then turned the gun on himself, both dying instantly.</p><p>Elvira Madigan's story continues to capture the imagination of artists and writers today, as a melancholic tale of youth, love, and desperation.</p><p>Elvira Madigan's death and the events leading up to it have been widely romanticized in literature and film. In fact, her story has been the subject of several films, including Bo Widerberg's "Elvira Madigan" in 1967, which won the Cannes Film Festival's Jury Prize. Her tragic end has inspired countless songs, and she has been referenced in the works of several artists and writers, including August Strindberg and Ingmar Bergman. Interestingly, the original ballad that inspired the "The Ballad of Elvira Madigan" was actually about a different couple, and only became associated with Madigan's story after her death. Despite her short life and tragic end, Elvira Madigan has become a literary and cultural icon, memorialized for her beauty, her youth, and her ill-fated love affair with Sixten Sparre.</p><p>In recent years, historians and writers have reexamined Elvira Madigan's story, seeking to understand her life beyond the tragic circumstances of her death. Some have suggested that she was a victim of Sparre's manipulation and abuse, while others have questioned the romanticization of her story and the way it has been appropriated by artists and filmmakers for their own purposes. Today, the name "Elvira Madigan" has become synonymous with the idea of doomed love, and her legacy continues to inspire artists and writers around the world. Despite the many different interpretations of her life and story, Elvira Madigan remains a symbol of the power and pitfalls of youth and passion, and a reminder of the enduring allure of tragedy and romance.</p><p></p><p>
						She died in suicide.
