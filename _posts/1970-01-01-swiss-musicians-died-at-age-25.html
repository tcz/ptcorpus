(January 15, 1916		Neuchâtel-May 14, 1941			Plötzensee Prison)


was
a Swiss
personality.


					</p><p>Maurice Bavaud was a Swiss student who attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler in 1938. He moved to Paris to study theology and became increasingly disillusioned with Hitler's policies. Bavaud made several attempts to warn the French and Swiss authorities of the impending danger of war, but his efforts were unsuccessful. </p><p>In October 1938, Bavaud traveled to Munich to attend a Hitler rally and attempted to shoot Hitler with a pistol, but missed due to the crowd. He was arrested and eventually turned over to the Gestapo by the Swiss police. After confessing to the assassination attempt, he was sentenced to death and executed by decapitation in Berlin's Plötzensee Prison in 1941.</p><p>Bavaud's attempt on Hitler's life has been largely forgotten in Switzerland, where he is not regarded as a hero due to the country's policy of neutrality during the war. However, in recent years, there has been renewed interest in his story and recognition of his courage and sacrifice.</p><p>According to some historians and scholars, Bavaud's assassination attempt may have been the closest anyone ever came to removing Hitler from power before the Second World War. Despite being thwarted in his efforts, Bavaud's act of bravery and opposition to Hitler's ideology has inspired many people over the years. Bavaud's story has been immortalized in various forms of media, including books, films, and documentaries. A commemorative plaque was also unveiled in his honor in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, in 2011, marking the seventieth anniversary of his execution. Today, Bavaud is remembered as a hero who tried to stop one of the most dangerous and destructive political movements of the twentieth century.</p><p></p><p>
