He was a multifaceted artist who believed in expressing himself through various mediums. </p><p>Wieman's personal life was marked by a series of tragedies. He lost his first wife, actress Ursula Deinert, in a plane crash in 1955. His son, Daniel, died at the age of 14 from a heart condition, and his daughter, Brigitte, died in a car accident in 1970, just months after her father's death.

It is not about being a star, but about telling stories that touch people's hearts."</p><p>Wieman's dedication to his craft and his humanitarian efforts continue to inspire people around the world. His commitment to authenticity and social responsibility serves as a reminder that the performing arts can be a powerful tool for promoting understanding and unity among people of different backgrounds and beliefs.</p><p>Wieman's impact on the world of theater and film was recognized even during his lifetime. He was awarded the Schiller Prize in 1949 for his contribution to German theater, and in 1952 he was awarded the Great Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.

In addition, he was awarded the Theater Prize of the City of Zurich in 1966. These honors reflect the high regard in which Wieman was held by his peers and colleagues in the world of the performing arts.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Wieman's personal life was marked by tragedy. His second wife, actress Ursula Herking, died in 1970, only a few months after Wieman's own death. Herking was the mother of Wieman's daughter, Brigitte, who died in a car accident shortly after her father's passing. These personal losses were a great sadness to Wieman, who had already suffered the loss of his first wife, Ursula Deinert, and his son, Daniel.</p><p>Despite his personal struggles, Wieman remained dedicated to his work and to promoting the art of acting. His legacy as an actor, director, teacher, and humanitarian continues to inspire future generations of performers and activists.

(August 14, 1902		Berlin-August 5, 1969			Berlin)

	
		otherwise known as Charlotte Perry-Ander or Charlotte Andersch

	
was
a German
actor.


						</p><p>She began her acting career in the 1920s, appearing in several silent films. In the 1930s, she became a popular actress in Nazi propaganda films, with her most well-known role being in the 1934 film "Hans Westmar", which glorified a Nazi martyr. After World War II, she continued to act in films and on stage, but her career suffered due to her involvement in the Nazi regime. In 1955, she was able to make a comeback with a role in the film "Egon, der Frauenheld" and acted regularly until her death in 1969. She was married to the film director Harald Paulsen from 1935 until his death in 1960.</p><p>Charlotte Ander's involvement with the Nazi regime did not end with her acting in propaganda films. She and her husband Harald Paulsen were also members of the Nazi party, and she served as a cultural ambassador for the regime. After World War II, Ander faced difficulties due to her past affiliations, and she struggled to find work as an actress. Despite this, Ander continued to work in the entertainment industry, and she also volunteered for various charitable causes. In the 1950s, she became a regular performer at the Hebbel Theater in Berlin. Ander's final film role was in the 1969 movie "Frau Wirtin hat auch eine Nichte". She died later that year in Berlin at the age of 66.</p><p>Her legacy remains a controversial topic in Germany, with some arguing that her involvement with the Nazi regime should not be forgotten, while others highlight her contributions to German cinema and theater. In recent years, her work has been re-evaluated by scholars, who note the complex circumstances surrounding her career during the Nazi era. Despite the controversy, her contributions to the film industry, particularly during the golden age of German cinema, are undeniable. Additionally, her dedication to volunteering and charitable causes in the years following the war demonstrate a commitment to making a positive impact on her community.</p><p>Ander's early life was marked by tragedy. Her mother died when she was only two years old, and her father later committed suicide. She was raised by her mother's sister and her husband, who encouraged her interest in the arts. Ander began studying acting at a young age and made her stage debut in 1919.</p><p>In addition to her acting career, Ander was also known for her advocacy work. She was a strong supporter of animal welfare and was involved in several organizations dedicated to protecting animals. She also spoke out against war and violence, using her platform as an actress to promote peace.</p><p>Despite her controversial past, Ander's talent as an actress cannot be denied. Film historian Robert Osborne called her "one of Germany's most beautiful and talented actresses of the pre-World War II era." Her performances in films such as "Der Herrscher" and "Gold" showcased her range as an actress and established her as one of the leading ladies of German cinema.</p><p>Today, Ander's legacy continues to be debated. Some argue that her Nazi affiliations should forever tarnish her reputation, while others believe that her contributions to German cinema and her philanthropic work should be celebrated. Regardless of one's opinion on her past, there is no denying that Charlotte Ander was a talented and dedicated actress who left an indelible mark on the world of film.</p><p>Additionally, it's worth noting that Ander was multilingual and often appeared in films in multiple languages, including English and French. She also worked with some of the most well-known German directors of her time, including Leni Riefenstahl and Veit Harlan. Despite her high profile in the film industry, Ander remained a private person throughout her life and rarely spoke publicly about her personal beliefs or political affiliations. Her legacy serves as a reminder of the complex history of German cinema and the role that actors played in shaping the cultural landscape of the country during the turbulent years leading up to World War II.</p><p>In recent years, efforts have been made to contextualize Ander's career within the broader social and political climate of her time. Scholarly books and articles have been published that explore the ways in which actors like Ander were used by the Nazi regime to promote their propaganda and how they navigated the political complexities of their era. These works also examine the challenges that Ander faced after the fall of the Nazi regime, as well as her efforts to reclaim her career and reputation in the years that followed.</p><p>Despite the ongoing debates about her legacy, Ander continues to be remembered as a talented actress and a significant figure in German cinema. Her contributions to the arts, as well as her advocacy work on behalf of animals and peace, serve as a testament to her commitment to making a positive impact on the world.</p><p>Ander's involvement with Nazi propaganda films was not unique among her peers, as many actors and actresses in Germany during the 1930s and 1940s participated in such productions. However, her legacy remains a subject of ongoing debate due to her high profile and the popularity of the films in which she appeared. </p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding her career, Ander is remembered for her contributions to animal welfare and peace activism. She was a founding member of the German Animal Welfare Society and served as its vice president from 1951 until her death in 1969. Ander was also a vocal opponent of nuclear weapons and supported various peace initiatives.</p><p>In addition to her acting career and philanthropic work, Ander was also a devoted mother to her two children. Her daughter, Grit Boettcher, followed in her mother's footsteps and became a successful actress in her own right.</p><p>Overall, Ander's legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the challenges and complexities of her times. While her involvement with Nazi propaganda films continues to be a subject of controversy, her talent as an actress and her dedication to important causes leave a lasting impression on the world of film and beyond.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Charlotte Ander was forced to flee Berlin towards the end of World War II due to the bombing and destruction of the city. She and her family sought refuge in Bavaria before returning to Berlin after the war. Ander's experiences during this time likely influenced her philanthropic work and her advocacy for peace.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding her past, Ander's talent as an actress and her contributions to German cinema cannot be denied. She appeared in over 60 films during her career and worked with some of the most prominent directors of her time. Her performances were lauded for their depth and range, and her beauty made her a popular leading lady.</p><p>In recent years, there have been renewed efforts to recognize Ander's contributions to German cinema while also acknowledging her past affiliations with the Nazi regime. Some have suggested that her work should be viewed in the context of the time period in which she lived and worked, while others argue that her past should forever disqualify her from public recognition.</p><p>Regardless of the ongoing debates, it is clear that Charlotte Ander left an indelible mark on the world of film and beyond. Her legacy serves as a reminder of the complex intersection between politics, culture, and the arts, and the ongoing importance of grappling with the legacies of historical figures.</p><p></p><p>

Jolles' career took off in the 1920s, and he played with many of the leading orchestras and chamber groups in Germany, frequently accompanying renowned soloists. </p><p>Despite his success, Jolles became increasingly disillusioned with the political situation in Germany in the 1930s, particularly following the Nazi Party's rise to power. He refused to perform in Nazi propaganda concerts and was ultimately forced to flee the country in 1934. </p><p>In Brazil, Jolles quickly established himself as a leading figure in the classical music scene. He performed regularly and taught at the São Paulo Conservatory of Music for over 20 years, where he was known for his emphasis on technique and artistic expression.

He incorporated Jewish folk music into his performances and recordings, and was known for his passionate renditions of works by Jewish composers such as Felix Mendelssohn and Sergei Prokofiev. Jolles was also a dedicated philanthropist and supported numerous charitable organizations throughout his life. He believed in the power of music to uplift and inspire, and worked tirelessly to ensure that everyone had the opportunity to experience its transformative effects.
