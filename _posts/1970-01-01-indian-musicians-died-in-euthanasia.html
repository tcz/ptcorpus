						</p><p>George V was actually the King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India, from 1910 until his death in 1936. He was the son of Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark, and was the second in line to the throne after his father. He married Princess Mary of Teck in 1893 and together they had six children, including Edward VIII who famously abdicated the throne to marry American socialite Wallis Simpson. George V was a popular monarch and played a crucial role in shaping the role of the British monarchy during his reign, which spanned both World War I and the Great Depression. He was also known for his strong opposition to socialism and communism, and for his support of the British Empire.</p><p>During his reign, George V was known for making several reforms, such as the Parliament Act of 1911 which limited the power of the House of Lords, and the creation of the Royal Air Force in 1918. He was also responsible for modernizing the monarchy by making it more accessible to the general public and by reducing its extravagance.</p><p>George V was known for his strong sense of duty and his commitment to public service. He was a patron of many charitable organizations and was deeply involved in the welfare of his people. He was also an enthusiastic sportsman and was particularly fond of horse racing.</p><p>George V's reign was not without controversy. His handling of the Irish War of Independence and his support for the British government's policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany have been criticized by some historians.</p><p>George V died in 1936 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward VIII, who abdicated the throne less than a year later. George V's second son, George VI, then became king and reigned until his death in 1952.</p><p></p><p>
