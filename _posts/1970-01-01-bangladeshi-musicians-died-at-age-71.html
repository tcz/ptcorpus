					</p><p>He is considered to be one of the most prominent and influential painters in the history of Bangladesh. Sultan's style of painting was heavily influenced by folk art traditions and his paintings often depicted the lives and struggles of the working class.</p><p>In addition to his career as a painter, Sultan was also a teacher and mentor to many aspiring artists. He taught and inspired generations of young artists in his native Bangladesh, helping to establish the country as a hub of artistic creativity and expression.</p><p>Sultan's work has been exhibited around the world and he is widely regarded as a pioneering figure in the development of modern South Asian art. His legacy continues to inspire and influence artists and art lovers around the world today.</p><p>Sultan was born in a farming family and grew up in poverty. He received little formal education but was passionate about art from a young age. In 1940, he traveled to Kolkata to study at the Government College of Art and Craft. However, he dropped out after a year due to financial constraints and returned to his village.</p><p>Sultan began his career as a signboard painter for shops and cinema halls. He later moved to Dhaka and worked as a book illustrator for a publishing house. His breakthrough came in 1952 when he held his first solo exhibition in Dhaka. His paintings received critical praise and he gained recognition for his unique style and subject matter.</p><p>Sultan's paintings often depicted the struggles of the working class, including farmers, fishermen, and laborers. His use of bold colors and strong brushstrokes, influenced by traditional Bengali art, conveyed a sense of emotion and energy. He also experimented with different mediums, including watercolor, oil, and mixed media.</p><p>In addition to his own work, Sultan was a dedicated teacher and mentor. He taught at several art schools in Bangladesh and was known for his innovative teaching methods. Many of his students went on to become successful artists in their own right.</p><p>Sultan's contributions to South Asian art were recognized with numerous awards and honors, including the Bangladesh Charu Shilpi Sangsad Award, the Ekushey Padak, and the National Award for Painting. Today, his paintings are highly sought after by collectors and art enthusiasts around the world.</p><p>Despite his success later in life, Sultan faced many hardships early on. He struggled with mental illness and alcoholism for much of his life, and also had to manage his financial difficulties while trying to establish himself as an artist. However, he persevered and continued to create and teach until his death in 1994 at the age of 71.</p><p>Sultan's impact on Bangladeshi art and culture was significant. He was a fierce advocate for the importance of preserving the country's cultural heritage and traditions, and he played a crucial role in establishing the Bangladesh art scene as a force to be reckoned with on the global stage. His legacy lives on in the work of his students and countless other artists who have been inspired by his vision and dedication to the arts.</p><p>Sultan's work and life have also been immortalized in museums and galleries internationally, including the National Museum of Bangladesh, the Tate Modern in London, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. His most famous work, "My Land," is a series of 19 paintings that depict the daily lives of Bangladeshi people and their struggles with poverty and corruption. The paintings were originally exhibited in 1979 and were later acquired by the Bangladesh government. </p><p>Sultan's legacy also extends beyond the world of art. He was a passionate advocate for social justice and political freedom, and his paintings often reflected his political beliefs. During the Bangladesh Liberation War, he used his art to raise awareness about the atrocities committed by the Pakistani army, and he was later appointed as a cultural representative by the newly formed government of Bangladesh. </p><p>In addition to his artistic and political contributions, Sultan was also a philanthropist and a lover of nature. He dedicated much of his personal wealth towards establishing schools, hospitals, and orphanages in his hometown, and he was a vocal advocate for environmental conservation. He often incorporated images of nature into his paintings, and his love of the outdoors inspired him to build his own home in the countryside, which he called "Shishu Palli," or "Children's Village." </p><p>S.M. Sultan's life and work continue to inspire and resonate with people across the globe, and he remains one of the most celebrated figures in the history of South Asian art.</p><p>Sultan's unconventional approach to art garnered him both praise and criticism. His use of bold colors and thick brushstrokes, while considered revolutionary by some, was seen as crude and unrefined by others. However, his commitment to depicting and honoring the lives of Bangladesh's working class made him a beloved figure among the people. Sultan was known to immerse himself in the lives of his subjects, spending long periods observing and interacting with them before committing their stories to canvas. This dedication to his craft and his subjects was recognized in 1973 when he was awarded the National Award for Painting by the Bangladesh government. </p><p>S.M. Sultan's influence on Bangladeshi art and culture in the 20th century was immense. His legacy lies not only in his paintings but also in his role as a teacher and his commitment to social and environmental causes. Today, his unconventional style continues to influence and inspire artists in Bangladesh and beyond. A museum dedicated to his life and work, the S.M. Sultan Shilpakala Academy Art Museum, was established in his hometown of Narail in 2017. Many consider him to be one of the greatest artists in the history of Bangladesh and a true icon of South Asian art.</p><p>Sultan's dedication to preserving the cultural heritage of Bangladesh extended beyond his art. He was passionate about traditional Bengali music and literature, often incorporating these elements into his paintings. He also played a key role in the establishment of the Folk Arts and Crafts Foundation, an organization dedicated to promoting and preserving traditional folk art forms in Bangladesh. Through his art and activism, Sultan helped to elevate the voices of marginalized communities in Bangladesh and bring attention to their struggles for justice and equality. Despite facing numerous challenges throughout his life, Sultan remained committed to his art and his vision for a more just and equitable society. His legacy continues to inspire artists and activists around the world to this day.</p><p></p><p>
