						</p><p>singer and performer, known for her over-the-top stage persona and flamboyant costumes. She rose to fame in the late 1970s and early 1980s with hits such as "Rock Me Baby" and "Samson". Starr was also known for her controversial appearances, and was once banned from performing in some venues due to her provocative stage presence. She retired from the music industry in the mid-1980s, but her legacy continues to influence Belgian pop culture to this day. In addition to her music career, Starr also dabbled in acting and appeared in several films and TV shows.</p><p>She was born in Laarne, Belgium, and began her music career as a teenage singer in local bands. Starr's breakthrough came in 1977 when she was discovered by Belgian producer Marc Van Beveren, who helped her secure a recording contract with RCA Records. Her debut album "Emly Starr Explosion" was released in 1978, and included the hit single "Samson", which topped the charts in Belgium and the Netherlands.</p><p>Starr's theatrical style and outrageous costumes quickly earned her a reputation as a showstopper, and she became a fixture on the European music scene throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. She toured extensively throughout Europe, and even made a few appearances in the US, although she never achieved significant success there. </p><p>Starr's popularity began to wane in the mid-1980s, and she retired from the music industry in 1986. She later dabbled in acting, appearing in several Belgian films and TV shows, and worked as a DJ and radio host. Despite her relatively short-lived music career, Starr's legacy continues to inspire performers in Belgium and beyond, and she is regarded as a trailblazer for eccentric and flamboyant musicians.</p><p>As an artist, Emly Starr was not only known for her music and stage presence, but also for her fashion sense. She often wore elaborate and over-the-top costumes, which added to her unique persona. Her style was influenced by glam rock and punk, and she was often compared to David Bowie and Freddie Mercury in terms of her boldness and creativity. Starr's music also reflected this genre-blending approach, incorporating elements of rock, disco, and pop.</p><p>After retiring from the music industry, Starr remained a beloved figure in Belgian pop culture. She continued to make occasional appearances on television and in the media, and her music has been covered and sampled by several contemporary Belgian artists. In 2016, a documentary about her life and career, "Emly Starr - The Voice of the Trash Generation", was released in Belgium, cementing her place as a cultural icon.</p><p>Throughout her career, Emly Starr challenged conventional norms of gender, identity, and performance in the music industry. Her legacy continues to inspire and influence a new generation of musicians and performers who value creativity, individuality, and self-expression.</p><p>Starr's impact went beyond her musical and fashion choices. She was seen as a trailblazer in the world of entertainment and an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights. Starr was one of the first openly gay celebrities in Belgium, and her boldness in living an authentic life helped pave the way for more acceptance and visibility for the LGBTQ+ community. She was also a vocal supporter of AIDS-related charities and participated in many fundraisers for the cause. Even in retirement, Starr continued to use her platform to advocate for marginalized and underrepresented communities. Despite facing backlash and censorship during her career, Starr remained unapologetically herself and left a lasting legacy as a fierce and passionate performer.</p><p></p><p>
