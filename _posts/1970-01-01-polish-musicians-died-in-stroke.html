					</p><p>Anny Ondra began her acting career in Czechoslovakia before making her way to Berlin, where she became a highly sought-after actress in the 1920s and 1930s. She appeared in many silent films and early sound films, often starring in romantic dramas and comedies. She is perhaps best known for her role in the Alfred Hitchcock thriller "Blackmail" (1929), in which she played a woman who kills a man in self-defense.</p><p>After a successful career in film, Ondra moved behind the camera and started her own film production company in Germany. She produced several films throughout the 1940s before retiring from the industry altogether in the early 1950s. Ondra lived a relatively private life in her later years, spending much of her time in her home in the countryside outside of Hamburg.</p><p>Despite her success in film, Ondra's life was not without its challenges. She suffered from a stammer which affected her ability to perform live on stage and may have contributed to her eventual transition to film. She was also briefly married to boxer Max Schmeling before their marriage was annulled due to her being Jewish.</p><p></p><p>
