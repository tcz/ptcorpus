					</p><p>Petrović was one of the most prominent Serbian artists of the early 20th century and is most well-known for her oil paintings and watercolors that depicted the struggles and realities of the Balkan people during times of war and social upheaval. She was a student of some of the most renowned artists of her time and was heavily influenced by post-impressionism and fauvism.</p><p>In addition to her artistic career, Petrović was also a staunch advocate for women's rights and often used her paintings to shed light on the injustices faced by women in Serbian society.

Her travels allowed her to gain exposure to various art forms and styles which she used in her own work to create a unique blend of post-impressionism and fauvism. Despite being recognized as one of the most talented artists of her era, her unconventional beliefs and her outspokenness regarding women's rights often put her at odds with the conservative Serbian society.</p><p>Some of Petrović's most famous works include The Fever (1912) and Kosovo Maiden (1919).

Many of her paintings were heavily influenced by her experiences during various Balkan Wars, where she witnessed the horrors of war and its impact on the lives of ordinary people.</p><p>Petrović's contributions to the feminist movement in Serbia have been widely acknowledged, and she is often referred to as the first feminist painter in the country.
