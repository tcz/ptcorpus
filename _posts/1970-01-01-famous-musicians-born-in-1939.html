(April 4, 1939		Belzoni-December 16, 2014)

	
		also known as Ernest Terrell or The Clutch

	
was
an American
record producer, musician and professional boxer.


						</p><p>Terrell began boxing in 1957 and quickly became a top contender in the heavyweight division. He won the vacant WBA heavyweight title in 1965 by defeating Eddie Machen, but lost it the following year to Muhammad Ali in a highly publicized bout that was marked by Ali's taunting of Terrell. </p><p>After retiring from boxing in 1973, Terrell turned to music and worked as a record producer for many years. He also released several albums of his own as a singer and musician, showcasing his soulful voice and skill on the piano.</p><p>Throughout his life, Terrell was heavily involved in various charitable causes, particularly those aimed at helping underprivileged youth. After his death in 2014, he was remembered as both a talented athlete and musician, as well as a dedicated humanitarian.</p><p>During his boxing career, Ernie Terrell compiled an impressive record of 46 wins (21 by knockouts) and 9 losses. He was known for his towering height (at 6'6") and long reach, which he used to wear down his opponents. However, his most memorable fight was against Muhammad Ali in 1967, which was dubbed the "The Fight of the Century". Ali, who had been stripped of his titles for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War, was looking to reclaim his crown by defeating Terrell. The fight was marked by Ali's anger towards Terrell, who had refused to call him by his Muslim name and instead called him by his birth name, Cassius Clay. Ali punished Terrell throughout the fight, taunting him by repeatedly asking, "What's my name?" He ultimately won by unanimous decision, but critics praised Terrell for his toughness and resilience. </p><p>Aside from his boxing and music careers, Terrell also devoted much of his time to various charitable organizations. He founded the Ernie Terrell Boxing Club in Chicago, which provided free boxing lessons and mentorship to at-risk youth. He also worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and other organizations that aimed to improve the lives of disadvantaged children. Over the years, he received numerous awards and commendations for his philanthropic work, including being named the Humanitarian of the Year by the WBC in 1997.</p><p>Terrell's passion for music started at a young age, and he often performed in school talent shows. After retiring from boxing, he pursued his love of music and worked with many well-known musicians such as Isaac Hayes, Barry White, and Minnie Riperton. Terrell's 1973 album, "My Knockouts," received critical acclaim and showcased his talents as a singer and pianist.</p><p>Despite his success in boxing and music, Terrell's legacy may be his commitment to helping others. He was known for his work with youth organizations in Chicago, and his efforts to give back to his community earned him widespread recognition. Ernie Terrell's impact on the world, both inside and outside of the ring, will not be forgotten.</p><p>After retiring from boxing, Terrell remained involved in the sport as a television commentator and analyst. He worked for ABC, CBS, ESPN, and HBO, providing expert analysis and insight into the boxing world. He was also a regular guest on talk shows and podcasts, where he shared his experiences and knowledge with audiences around the world. </p><p>Throughout his life, Terrell faced many challenges and setbacks, but he never gave up on his dreams or his desire to help others. He was a true role model for aspiring athletes, musicians, and philanthropists, and his legacy continues to inspire generations of people to follow their passions and make a difference in their communities.</p><p></p><p>
