In addition to his groundbreaking work on the runway, McQueen also designed costumes for films, including the 2011 blockbuster, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."

His legacy lives on through the Alexander McQueen brand, which continues to push the boundaries of fashion and remains a highly respected and influential force in the industry.</p><p>McQueen grew up in London and left school at the age of 16 to pursue a career in fashion. He studied at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, where he earned his master's degree in fashion design. His graduate collection, "Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims," was purchased in its entirety by influential fashion stylist Isabella Blow, who became McQueen's mentor and championed his work.

Despite the controversy surrounding his work, or perhaps because of it, McQueen's designs were beloved by celebrities and fashion insiders alike, with clients including Lady Gaga, Rihanna, and Sarah Jessica Parker.</p><p>In addition to his innovative fashion designs, McQueen also made a name for himself as a costume designer for films and theater productions.

His legacy continues to inspire designers around the world to take risks and challenge the status quo.</p><p></p><p>
