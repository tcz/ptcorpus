(March 10, 1865		China-September 28, 1898)


was
a Chinese
philosopher.


					</p><p>He was well known for his advocacy of political and social reform in China during the late Qing dynasty. Tan Sitong was an imperial scholar who studied under Kang Youwei, a prominent reformer of the time. He was also a member of the Hundred Days' Reform, a failed attempt in 1898 to modernize China's political and social systems. Tan Sitong was sentenced to death by the Qing government for his involvement in the reform movement and executed at the age of 33. Despite his short life, he left behind a legacy of progressive thought and critical analysis of traditional Chinese values, which inspired future generations of Chinese reformers.</p><p>Tan Sitong was born in Haining, Zhejiang Province, China. He was born into a wealthy family and received a traditional Confucian education during his early years. However, he was deeply influenced by the writings of Western philosophers such as John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer, which sparked his interest in political and social reform.</p><p>In the early 1890s, Tan Sitong became a member of the Guangfuhui (Society for the Restoration of China), a secret society that advocated for political reform and the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. He met Kang Youwei, a fellow member of the society who became his mentor and introduced him to the ideas of constitutional government and the rule of law.</p><p>In 1895, Tan Sitong was appointed as an imperial scholar and joined the Hanlin Academy, a prestigious institution for scholars in Beijing. While there, he continued to advocate for political and social reform and became involved in the Hundred Days' Reform in 1898. This reform movement aimed to modernize China's political and social systems by promoting Western-style education, establishing a constitutional government, and curbing the power of the conservative factions of the Qing court.</p><p>However, the reform movement was met with resistance from the conservative elements of the Qing government, including Empress Dowager Cixi. The reforms were abolished, and Kang Youwei and Tan Sitong were among the reformers who were sentenced to death for their involvement in the movement. Tan Sitong was executed on September 28, 1898.</p><p>Despite his short life, Tan Sitong became a celebrated figure in Chinese history and is considered one of the pioneers of China's movement towards political and social modernization. His legacy inspired future generations of Chinese reformers to continue fighting for political and social change.</p><p></p><p>
