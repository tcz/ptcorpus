(April 5, 2015		Kabul-April 5, 1980)


was
an Afghan
personality.


					</p><p>He was the founder and spiritual leader of the Taliban, a militant organization that controlled much of Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001. As the leader of the Taliban, Omar was known for his strict interpretation of Sharia law and his harsh treatment of women and minorities. He was also responsible for harboring al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, which led to the United States' invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Despite being one of the most wanted men in the world, Omar evaded capture until his death in 2013, which was only revealed to the public two years later.</p><p>Before his leadership of the Taliban, Omar was a respected religious scholar and fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. He lost one eye during a battle, which led to his nickname, "Mullah" (meaning "one-eyed" in Arabic). After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Omar became disillusioned with the infighting among various mujahideen factions and established the Taliban in 1994. </p><p>During the Taliban's rule, Afghanistan became a pariah state due to their treatment of women and their support of terrorism. Omar maintained a reclusive image and only appeared in public a few times. He was known for his simplicity and humility, often living in a mud hut and riding a bicycle. Despite his controversial actions, Omar remained a revered figure to many Afghans due to his religious knowledge and perceived incorruptibility. </p><p>Following the fall of the Taliban in 2001, Omar went into hiding and continued to lead the insurgency against the Afghan government and coalition forces. He rarely communicated directly with his followers and delegated many responsibilities to his deputies. In 2013, it was announced that Omar had died in Pakistan in 2013, reportedly from tuberculosis. However, the circumstances surrounding his death and the delay in its announcement have been the subject of speculation and controversy.</p><p>Omar was born in the village of Nodeh in northern Afghanistan. His father was a spiritual leader and Omar received his early education at a mosque school in his village. He later studied at a seminary in the Pakistani city of Karachi and became a prominent cleric. He returned to Afghanistan in the late 1970s, just as the country was being invaded by the Soviet Union. Omar joined the resistance against the Soviet occupation and later became a military commander.</p><p>After the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan was plunged into a period of chaos and violence as competing factions vied for power. Omar became disillusioned with the infighting and corruption among the mujahideen leaders and began to preach a return to a purer form of Islam. He established the Taliban in 1994, which initially gained support for its promise to restore order, eliminate corruption, and provide security to the people.</p><p>Under Omar's leadership, the Taliban gained control of most of Afghanistan by 1996, imposing a strict interpretation of Sharia law that banned music, television, and other modern forms of entertainment. Women were forced to wear burqas and were prohibited from attending school or working outside the home. The Taliban also provided sanctuary to Osama bin Laden and his followers, who had been expelled from Sudan and were seeking a new base of operations.</p><p>The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, carried out by al-Qaeda, led to the US invasion of Afghanistan and the overthrow of the Taliban government. Omar went into hiding and continued to lead the Taliban insurgency from a secret location. His death in 2013 was a blow to the Taliban, but the group has continued to wage a bloody insurgency against the Afghan government and its allies.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Omar is still considered a significant figure in Afghan history. Some view him as a hero who led the fight against the Soviet occupation and brought stability to Afghanistan during the early years of the Taliban's rule. Others see him as a fanatic who brutalized the people of Afghanistan and played a role in the rise of global terrorism. Omar's life and legacy have been the subject of numerous books, documentaries, and articles, and his name remains a topic of controversy and debate.</p><p>Omar's leadership also led to tensions with neighboring countries, particularly with Iran and Pakistan. Iran saw the Taliban's extreme Sunni views as a threat to their Shia majority, while Pakistan supported the Taliban as a means of maintaining influence in Afghanistan. However, the relationship between Omar and Pakistan deteriorated after the 9/11 attacks, with Pakistan choosing to side with the United States against the Taliban.Omar also had a reputation for being a skilled military strategist, often relying on surprise attacks and guerrilla warfare tactics against his enemies. Despite being elusive and rarely seen in public, he was respected by his followers and feared by his enemies. He was known for his ability to unite disparate factions under the banner of the Taliban and for his strict adherence to Islamic law.Despite his strict interpretation of Islam, Omar was in favor of education for men and women. While he enforced strict rules for women's education, he allowed girls to attend school in the early years of the Taliban's rule. However, this policy was later reversed as the Taliban's views on women's rights became more extreme.Omar's death in 2013 was shrouded in secrecy and controversy. Some reports indicate that he died of natural causes, while others suggest that he was assassinated. The Taliban did not immediately confirm or deny his death, leading to speculation that they were attempting to regroup and maintain their operations.Omar's legacy continues to be felt in Afghanistan and the wider region. The Taliban remains a powerful force, despite attempts to suppress their activities, and the country remains plagued by instability and violence. Despite the controversy surrounding his life and leadership, Omar's commitment to his beliefs and his determination to fight for his vision of Afghanistan have made him a significant figure in the country's history.</p><p>During his reign, Omar also oversaw strict laws regarding drug usage, particularly heroin. The Taliban implemented a complete ban on poppy cultivation, which was the main source of income for many Afghan farmers. This led to a significant decrease in heroin production in Afghanistan, though it also led to economic hardship for many farmers who relied on the drug trade for their livelihood. Despite this, the ban on poppy cultivation became one of the few policies that the Taliban were praised for by the international community.Omar's leadership of the Taliban also had a significant impact on the lives of Afghan women. The strict laws surrounding their dress and behavior led to widespread protests from women's rights groups and international organizations. Women who dared to speak out against the Taliban were often punished harshly, and there were reports of women being publicly flogged or executed for disobeying the Taliban's laws.Omar's death in 2013 marked the end of an era for the Taliban, though the group has continued to operate in Afghanistan and remains a significant challenge to the Afghan government and its allies. The circumstances surrounding his death and the controversy surrounding his leadership have made him a controversial and divisive figure, both in Afghanistan and the wider world. Nevertheless, his commitment to the Taliban's cause and his skill as a military commander have left a lasting mark on the country's history.</p><p></p><p>
