(November 20, 1915		Changsha-April 15, 1989			Beijing)


was
a Chinese
politician.


					
			
		He had
		four
		children,
		Hu Deping, Hu Liu, Hu Dehua and Li Heng.

						</p><p>Hu Yaobang was a prominent figure in Chinese politics, serving as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China from 1981 until 1987. He was known for his progressive views and efforts to reform and modernize the country's political and economic systems.</p><p>During his tenure, Hu implemented a series of reforms that paved the way for China's economic liberalization and opening up to the West. He also worked to promote cultural and intellectual freedom, advocating for greater tolerance of dissenting opinions and a more open exchange of ideas.</p><p>Hu's reformist policies ultimately led to his downfall. In 1987, he was forced to resign from his post as General Secretary amid growing opposition from conservative elements within the Communist Party. His death two years later sparked widespread public protests and a government crackdown on dissenting voices, culminating in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Hu is widely regarded as one of the most influential political figures in modern Chinese history.</p><p>Hu Yaobang was born in Hunan province in 1915 to a family of modest means. He was a member of the Communist Party of China from a young age and spent much of his early career organizing unions and peasant movements in rural areas of the country. He rose to prominence in the Communist Party in the 1960s and 1970s, serving as the party chief in several provinces before being appointed as General Secretary in 1981.</p><p>As General Secretary, Hu championed a number of reforms that were aimed at modernizing China's economy and improving the lives of ordinary citizens. He introduced measures to encourage foreign investment, deregulated certain industries, and pursued a policy of economic liberalization that helped to unleash the country's entrepreneurial spirit. At the same time, he sought to address social problems such as corruption, inefficiency, and inequality, and encouraged greater openness and transparency in government.</p><p>Hu's efforts to promote more liberal values in China were controversial, however, and he faced opposition from conservative elements within the Communist Party who viewed his policies as a threat to socialism. In 1987, he was forced to resign from his post as General Secretary after being accused of being too sympathetic to the pro-democracy movement that was emerging in China at the time.</p><p>Following his resignation, Hu remained a popular figure among reform-minded intellectuals and students, and his death in 1989 sparked mass demonstrations and protests throughout the country. The subsequent government crackdown on the protesters, culminating in the Tiananmen Square massacre, remains one of the most traumatic events in recent Chinese history.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his life and legacy, Hu Yaobang is still remembered by many as a visionary leader who sought to transform China into a more open and democratic society. He was widely regarded as a sincere and honest politician who cared deeply about the well-being of his fellow citizens, and his legacy continues to inspire reform-minded activists in China and around the world.</p><p>Hu Yaobang's death on April 15, 1989, while it initially drew mourners expressing their sadness, eventually evolved into protests and demonstrations that grew increasingly vocal in their demands for democracy, freedom of speech, and an end to corruption. His funeral was attended by tens of thousands of mourners who turned it into a public display of dissent, with some participants holding large banners calling for political reform. This activity eventually led to the occupation of Tiananmen Square by pro-democracy protesters in May 1989, which ultimately ended in a violent crackdown by the Chinese government on June 4th of that year. The events that followed his death and the subsequent massacre had a profound impact on China's political landscape, leading to a reintroduction of conservative policies and a crackdown on political dissent that would last for years.</p><p>Hu Yaobang's legacy lives on as a symbol of political reform and democratic ideals in China. Many of his ideas and principles continue to inspire young activists who are fighting for human rights and greater freedom in China. In recognition of his contributions to the country's political and economic development, China's government posthumously awarded Hu with the title of "Great Leader for National Rejuvenation and Social Progress" in 2011. However, his memory remains a sensitive issue in China, with the government wary of any discussion or commemoration of the events of 1989 that led to his fall from power and subsequent public outcry. Nonetheless, his legacy continues to serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of political reform and the pursuit of democratic values in China and around the world.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Hu Yaobang was also a noted writer and scholar. He authored several books on political theory and history, including a study of the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. Outside of his work, Hu was known for his passion for classical music and his love of the game of chess. He was also a devoted husband to his wife Li Zhao, who remained by his side throughout his political career and later in his final years until his death. Today, Hu Yaobang's legacy is remembered as both a period of progress and optimism for China's future, as well as a reminder of the dangers of authoritarianism and political suppression.</p><p>Hu Yaobang's influence on China's political landscape has continued long after his death, with many of his ideas still influential today. He was a strong advocate for democracy and reform, and he believed that greater freedom of speech and of the press would lead to a more vibrant and prosperous China. Despite his downfall and the government crackdown on dissent that followed, his impact on Chinese politics cannot be overstated. Today, he is remembered as a key figure in the country's modern history, and his contributions to political and economic reform continue to inspire those who seek to build a better future for China.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1897		Liaoning-July 13, 1970			Taipei)

	
		also known as Sheng Shih-ts&#039;ai

	
was
a Chinese
politician and military officer.


					</p><p>He was born in the northeastern province of Liaoning and began his military career in the warlord period. In the 1920s, he joined the Kuomintang (KMT) and served as an officer in the National Revolutionary Army. During the Chinese Civil War, Sheng initially supported the KMT, but in 1937 he defected to the Communist Party of China. </p><p>In 1940, Sheng was appointed as the governor of Xinjiang, a position he held until 1949. During his tenure, he maintained a degree of autonomy from the central Chinese government and implemented policies to modernize the province, such as expanding infrastructure and establishing a university. However, he also carried out brutal purges of political dissidents and ethnic minorities. </p><p>After the Communist victory in 1949, Sheng fled to the Soviet Union but was eventually deported back to China. He was imprisoned for several years before being released and allowed to move to Taiwan in 1954, where he lived out the rest of his life.</p><p>In Taiwan, Sheng became a vocal critic of the Chinese Communist Party and published articles and books that were critical of their policies in Xinjiang. He also served as a consultant for the government on Xinjiang-related issues. However, his reputation in Taiwan was somewhat tarnished by his past actions in Xinjiang, particularly his purges of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities. Despite this, he remained an influential figure in Taiwanese politics until his death in 1970. Sheng's legacy remains a complex one, with some viewing him as a traitor to his country for defecting to the Communist party, while others recognize his modernization efforts in Xinjiang but condemn his human rights abuses.</p><p>Sheng Shicai's rise to power in Xinjiang was marked by his alliances with different groups. Initially, he was supported by the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists, but after he became governor, he began to distance himself from them and moved towards a more pro-KMT stance. However, his policies still reflected Soviet influence, and he implemented land reform measures and promoted secularism. He also employed a number of Soviet advisors, who helped to modernize Xinjiang's industries and transportation infrastructure. </p><p>Despite these efforts, Sheng's tenure in Xinjiang was marred by human rights abuses. He carried out mass arrests and executions of suspected political dissidents and members of minority groups, such as Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Tibetans. His policies towards minority groups were also marked by forced resettlement, religious suppression, and cultural assimilation. As a result, he is sometimes called the "Butcher of Xinjiang". </p><p>After his release from prison in China, Sheng wrote several books in which he tried to justify his actions in Xinjiang. He argued that he was able to maintain stability in a province that was beset by turmoil, and that his policies were necessary to prevent separatism and maintain unity. However, his justifications have been met with skepticism by many historians and human rights advocates.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Sheng remains an important figure in Chinese history. His career reflects the shifting alliances and power struggles that characterized the early decades of the 20th century, and his actions in Xinjiang continue to reverberate today as China grapples with issues of minority rights and ethnic conflict.</p><p>Sheng Shicai's legacy also extends beyond his political career. He was a prolific writer and poet, and his works have been translated into several languages. His poetry often explored themes of love, patriotism, and the beauty of nature. He was particularly influenced by the classical poets of the Tang dynasty, and his writing style was characterized by its simplicity and clarity. His most famous work, "The Yellow River Cantata", was a patriotic ode to the Yellow River and its importance in Chinese culture and history.</p><p>Additionally, Sheng was known for his personal quirks and idiosyncrasies. He had a particular fondness for exotic animals, and kept a menagerie of pets throughout his life, including monkeys, parrots, and even a tiger. He was also a skilled calligrapher and painter, and his artwork was exhibited in galleries throughout Taiwan.</p><p>Despite his controversial past, Sheng Shicai was widely admired for his intellect and his contributions to Chinese culture and literature. In many ways, his life reflects the complexities and contradictions of modern Chinese history, and his legacy continues to be the subject of debate and study today.</p><p>Throughout his life, Sheng Shicai also had several key collaborations and relationships. For example, in 1934 he was involved in the Long March of the Red Army, which led to his friendship with Xi Zhongxun, the father of current Chinese President Xi Jinping. Additionally, Sheng had a close relationship with the Soviet intelligence officer Vasily Blyukher, who helped establish him as the governor of Xinjiang. However, after Blyukher's arrest during Stalin's purges, Sheng's relationship with the Soviet Union deteriorated. Sheng's personal life was also marked by tragedy. His first wife died during the Long March, and his second wife was executed during the purges in Xinjiang. Sheng himself was rumored to have been poisoned, although the circumstances of his death remain unclear.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Sheng Shicai was widely recognized for his contributions to the modernization of Xinjiang. Under his leadership, infrastructure was greatly improved and new industries were established. He oversaw the construction of highways, railways, airports, and hospitals, which helped to connect Xinjiang with the rest of China. He also established a university in Xinjiang, which was the first of its kind in the region. Sheng's efforts to modernize the province had a lasting impact, as Xinjiang remains an important center of industry, commerce, and transportation in China today.</p><p>In addition to his governance of Xinjiang, Sheng also had a significant impact on the development of Chinese literature and culture. He was a prolific writer and poet, and his works have been translated into several languages. His poetry often explored themes of love, patriotism, and the beauty of nature.
