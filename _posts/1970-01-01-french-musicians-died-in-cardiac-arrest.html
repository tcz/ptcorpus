She starred in numerous films, including "The Mother and the Whore," "La Fiancée du pirate," and "The Day of the Jackal." She was known for her naturalistic acting style and her ability to convey complex emotions on screen.

In addition to her work in film, she also appeared in several television series and theater productions. Lafont received numerous awards for her contributions to French cinema, including the Prix Jean Vigo and the National Order of Merit.</p><p>Lafont was born to a family of artists, her father being a sculptor and her mother an actress. She was encouraged to pursue acting from a young age and made her stage debut when she was just 16 years old. After completing her education, Lafont moved to Paris to pursue a career in acting. </p><p>Her breakthrough role was in the 1958 film “Les Mistons”, directed by François Truffaut, where she played the female lead. She went on to star in several other films by Truffaut including “Une belle fille comme moi” and “Baisers volés”.</p><p>Lafont's career continued to flourish throughout the 1960s and 70s, with notable performances in films such as "The Mother and the Whore," which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and "La Fiancée du pirate," which earned her a César nomination for Best Actress.</p><p>Lafont remained active in the French film industry until her death in 2013, continuing to work in a variety of films and television programs. In addition to her acting career, she was also an advocate for animal rights and worked with several animal rights organizations. Her talent, courage, and dedication have left a lasting legacy in French cinema.</p><p>Lafont was also known for her personal life, often making headlines for her relationship with French director Claude Chabrol, with whom she had a son, actor and director David Lafont. She was married three times, including to film director and producer Diourka Medveczky. Lafont's influence on French cinema can still be seen today, as she paved the way for generations of female actors and directors.
