					</p><p>Eduardo Lonardi was a career military officer who served in various positions in the Argentine army, including Chief of Staff of the Air Force and commander of the Second Army Corps. He is best known, however, for his role in the 1955 coup d'état that overthrew President Juan Perón and installed a military junta in Argentina. Lonardi was made President of Argentina following the ousting of Perón, but he only served for a little over two months before being replaced by General Pedro Eugenio Aramburu. After his removal from office, Lonardi retired from politics and returned to his military career, eventually earning the rank of lieutenant general. Though his brief presidency was marked by relatively lenient measures towards Perónists, Lonardi was soon seen as too moderate and was pushed aside by more hardline elements within the military. Despite this, he remained a respected figure in Argentine society until his death in 1956.</p><p></p><p>
