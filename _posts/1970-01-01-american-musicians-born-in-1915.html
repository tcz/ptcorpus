Gallion made his debut with the Cleveland Indians in 1940 and played 109 games at shortstop in his rookie season, recording a .219 batting average with two home runs and 30 runs batted in.

He later went on to study at the Texas Southern University and started his music career thereafter. </p><p>Johnson's musical legacy is mainly attributed to the creation of the Kashmere Stage Band, which went on to win numerous national competitions and became a sensation in the world of jazz music. He is credited with revolutionizing the high school band scene by incorporating funk and soul elements into his music.</p><p>In addition to his musical prowess, Johnson was also a dedicated music educator who taught in the Houston Independent School District for over 30 years. His methods of teaching and arranging music were innovative, and many of his students went on to become successful musicians in their own right.</p><p>Throughout his career, Johnson received many accolades for his contributions to music, including induction into the Texas Bandmasters Hall of Fame and the International Association for Jazz Education Hall of Fame. He passed away at the age of 92, leaving behind a rich legacy of music and education.</p><p>Aside from his work with the Kashmere Stage Band, Conrad Johnson also worked with other popular musicians such as B.B. King, Louis Armstrong, and Duke Ellington. He was highly respected among his peers and was known for his impeccable musicianship and leadership skills. He was also a trailblazer for his time, as he was one of the first African American band directors in the Houston Independent School District. In addition to teaching, Johnson was also an advocate for music education and dedicated much of his life to promoting the importance of music in schools. Today, he is remembered as a music pioneer who left an indelible mark on the world of jazz and education.</p><p>Despite facing discrimination and setbacks throughout his career, Conrad Johnson persevered and continued to innovate and inspire others in the music community. He was known for his charismatic personality and ability to connect with his audience through his music. Johnson's legacy continues to inspire new generations of musicians and music educators, and his impact on the Houston and national music scene remains unparalleled. In 2019, a documentary titled "Thunder Soul" was released, documenting the musical journey of the Kashmere Stage Band under Johnson's leadership.
