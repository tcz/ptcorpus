He painted and drew throughout his life, and his artwork often reflected his interest in the cultures he studied. His paintings of the Kwaio people, for example, are highly regarded for their depiction of the intricacies of Kwaio funeral rituals and other cultural practices. Fortune's artwork has been exhibited in galleries around the world and is held in numerous collections, including the National Museum of New Zealand.Technology also played an important role in Fortune's work, particularly in his use of audio recording equipment. He believed that recorded sound could capture important cultural details and nuances that might be missed in written accounts or visual media. As a result, he conducted numerous recordings of Kwaio music, oral histories, and other cultural practices. Some of these recordings were later published in scholarly journals or used in his own research.For all his accomplishments, however, Fortune remained relatively unknown outside of academic circles during his lifetime. It was only after his death that his contributions to anthropology and cultural understanding began to receive greater recognition. Today, he is remembered not only as a pioneering anthropologist, but as a passionate advocate for social justice and cultural exchange.</p><p></p><p>
