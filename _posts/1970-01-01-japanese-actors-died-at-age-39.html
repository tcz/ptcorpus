							Rikidōzan was born as Kim Sin-rak in what is now North Korea, and later became a Japanese national. He was the first non-Japanese wrestler to achieve the rank of yokozuna in Japan's national sumo wrestling. He retired from sumo in 1950 and transitioned to professional wrestling in Japan, eventually becoming known as the father of Japanese wrestling or Puroresu. Rikidōzan became a cultural icon in Japan and South Korea, and his involvement in the development of wrestling in Japan is widely celebrated. However, he was tragically murdered in 1963 by a gangster in Tokyo, which caused a media sensation at the time. Despite his untimely death, Rikidōzan's legacy lives on as an important figure in the history of combat sports in Japan and around the world.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=1658891" title="Wikipedia article about Rikidōzan">Rikidōzan on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/french-actors-died-in-2008.html' title='French actors died in 2008'><strong>French actors died in 2008</strong> List of the top 17 French actors who died in 2008</a></li><li><a href='/irish-actors-died-in-1984.html' title='Irish actors died in 1984'><strong>Irish actors died in 1984</strong> List of the top 1 Irish actors who died in 1984</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-actors-died-in-1960.html' title='Japanese actors died in 1960'><strong>Japanese actors died in 1960</strong> List of the top 3 Japanese actors who died in 1960</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/dutch-actresses-died-in-esophageal-cancer.html' title='Dutch actresses died in Esophageal cancer'><strong>Dutch actresses died in Esophageal cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Dutch actresses who died in Esophageal cancer</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actresses-died-in-traumatic-brain-injury.html' title='Famous actresses died in Traumatic brain injury'><strong>Famous actresses died in Traumatic brain injury</strong> List of the top 2 Famous actresses who died in Traumatic brain injury</a></li><li><a href='/swedish-actors-died-at-age-59.html' title='Swedish actors died at age 59'><strong>Swedish actors died at age 59</strong> List of the top 2 Swedish actors who died when they were 59</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
