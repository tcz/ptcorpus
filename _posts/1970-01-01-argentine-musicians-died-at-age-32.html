									</h1><p>Here are 7 famous musicians from Argentina died at 32:</p><h2>Mariano Moreno</h2><p><strong>Mariano Moreno</strong>
(September 23, 1778		Buenos Aires-March 4, 1811)


was
an Argentine
lawyer, writer, journalist and politician.


					</p><p>He played a key role in the Argentine War of Independence against Spain and was one of the main ideologists behind the May Revolution of 1810, which marked the beginning of the Argentine War of Independence. Moreno was a strong advocate for democracy and human rights, and is remembered for his efforts to establish a republican form of government in Argentina. He founded the first national newspaper in Argentina, La Gazeta de Buenos Ayres, and also wrote a series of important documents and decrees, including the "Plan of Operation," which laid out his vision for the future of the country. Sadly, Moreno died young, at just 32 years old, and his contributions to Argentina's independence movement have been largely overshadowed by the legacy of other leaders, such as José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar. Despite this, Moreno is still celebrated as a hero and a symbol of the struggle for freedom and democracy in Argentina.</p><p></p><p>
