actor, film director and screenwriter.



						</p><p>Palitzsch, whose family moved to Germany when he was young, trained as an actor at the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Berlin. He made his stage debut in 1939, and after serving in the War, went on to become a prominent member of the German theatrical scene. He also made several notable film appearances, including in "Der Arzt von Stalingrad" (1958) and "Kreuzer Emden" (1961). He is perhaps best known, however, for his work as a director and writer, particularly in the field of avant-garde theatre. Palitzsch's productions often incorporated elements of Brechtian theory, and he was a key collaborator of Bertolt Brecht in the 1950s and 60s. He went on to direct productions around the world, including in Japan, the United States, and Argentina. In addition to his theatrical work, Palitzsch was a committed political activist, and was involved in various progressive causes throughout his life.</p><p>Palitzsch started to gain notoriety in the 1950s with his productions of classics by authors such as Shakespeare and Goethe, which he staged in innovative ways. He wasn't afraid to experiment with different forms and styles of theatre, which led to him becoming a leading figure of the avant-garde movement.</p><p>His most famous production is perhaps his staging of Brecht's "Mother Courage and Her Children", which premiered in Stuttgart in 1959, and toured worldwide thereafter. Palitzsch's production was notable for its minimalist approach, using few props and a blank stage to highlight the dialogue and characters. Brecht was so impressed with Palitzsch's interpretation of his play that he personally invited him to collaborate on several other productions.</p><p>Another one of Palitzsch's notable productions was his staging of Heiner Müller's "Die Hamletmaschine" at the Berliner Ensemble in 1977. Palitzsch's work on this production was praised for its striking visual impact, which included metal scaffolds, skull masks, and strobe lights.</p><p>Palitzsch was a respected teacher and mentor to numerous theatre students throughout his life, including the renowned theatre director, Peter Stein. He continued to direct productions up until his death in 2004, leaving behind a legacy of innovative and visionary theatre.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/malaysian-actors-died-in-1961.html' title='Malaysian actors died in 1961'><strong>Malaysian actors died in 1961</strong> List of the top 1 Malaysian actors who died in 1961</a></li><li><a href='/danish-musicians-died-at-age-36.html' title='Danish musicians died at age 36'><strong>Danish musicians died at age 36</strong> List of the top 2 Danish music stars who died when they were 36</a></li><li><a href='/hungarian-actresses-died-in-2002.html' title='Hungarian actresses died in 2002'><strong>Hungarian actresses died in 2002</strong> List of the top 1 Hungarian actresses who died in 2002</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/bulgarian-actors-born-in-1966.html' title='Bulgarian actors born in 1966'><strong>Bulgarian actors born in 1966</strong> List of the top 5 Bulgarian actors who were born in 1966</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actresses-died-in-smallpox.html' title='Famous actresses died in Smallpox'><strong>Famous actresses died in Smallpox</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actresses who died in Smallpox</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-actors-died-in-2007.html' title='Austrian actors died in 2007'><strong>Austrian actors died in 2007</strong> List of the top 3 Austrian actors who died in 2007</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
