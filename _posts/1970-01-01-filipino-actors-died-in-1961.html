							Gemora's early career began as a comic actor in Filipino vaudeville, but he soon found a new passion in creating costumes and makeup effects for the movies. In 1933, he moved to Hollywood to work for the RKO studio, where he became known for his skill as a gorilla suit performer. His gorilla suits were so realistic that they were used in many films throughout the 1930s and 40s, including "King Kong" (1933) and "Mighty Joe Young" (1949), earning him the title "King of the Gorilla Men." He was also a pioneer in the use of foam latex for special effects makeup, which is still used to this day. In addition to his work in Hollywood, Gemora also appeared in a few films as an actor, often playing the roles of monsters or jungle natives. He passed away in 1961 at the age of 58.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=22489272" title="Wikipedia article about Charles Gemora">Charles Gemora on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/turkish-actors-born-in-1956.html' title='Turkish actors born in 1956'><strong>Turkish actors born in 1956</strong> List of the top 6 Turkish actors who were born in 1956</a></li><li><a href='/polish-actresses-died-at-age-54.html' title='Polish actresses died at age 54'><strong>Polish actresses died at age 54</strong> List of the top 1 Polish actresses who died when they were 54</a></li><li><a href='/english-actors-died-in-brain-tumor.html' title='English actors died in Brain tumor'><strong>English actors died in Brain tumor</strong> List of the top 2 English actors who died in Brain tumor</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/austrian-actors-born-in-1942.html' title='Austrian actors born in 1942'><strong>Austrian actors born in 1942</strong> List of the top 5 Austrian actors who were born in 1942</a></li><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-struck-by-car.html' title='American actors died in Struck by car'><strong>American actors died in Struck by car</strong> List of the top 1 American actors who died in Struck by car</a></li><li><a href='/italian-actresses-died-in-1981.html' title='Italian actresses died in 1981'><strong>Italian actresses died in 1981</strong> List of the top 3 Italian actresses who died in 1981</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
