		He had
		four
		children,
		Kurt Patrello, Jeffery Patrello, Shawn Patrello and Mark Patrello.

						</p><p>Petrillo is best known for his uncanny impression of Jerry Lewis, which led to his roles in several comedy films such as "Bel-Air Bandits" and "The Disorderly Orderly". However, his career was also marred by controversy, particularly his involvement in a lawsuit with Lewis, who sued him for copyright infringement in 1956. Despite this setback, Petrillo continued performing and even appeared on various TV shows such as "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" and "The Ed Sullivan Show". Later in life, he retired from showbiz and became a jewelry salesman. Petrillo passed away in 2009 due to complications from diabetes.</p><p>Petrillo's career began in the 1950s when he met Duke Mitchell, a fellow comedian who was also known for his impressions. The two of them formed a comedy team and performed in clubs across the country. They soon caught the attention of Hollywood and were signed to make several low-budget films. However, their partnership was short-lived as they had a falling out and went their separate ways.</p><p>Apart from his comedy career, Petrillo also had a passion for music. He played the saxophone and sang in a band called The Medallions. Their biggest hit was "The Letter" which reached No. 9 on the US R&B charts in 1954.</p><p>In later years, Petrillo struggled with health issues and financial troubles. He was also estranged from his son Kurt, who had accused him of neglect and abuse. Despite these difficulties, he remained upbeat and continued to perform whenever he could.</p><p>Petrillo's legacy lives on, particularly in the world of comedy where his impression of Jerry Lewis is still remembered and celebrated. He also inspired other comedians to hone their craft and develop their own voices.</p><p>In addition to his Hollywood career, Sammy Petrillo made a name for himself in the world of comedy clubs. He performed regularly in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, and was known for his high-energy performances that incorporated physical comedy and crowd interaction. Despite his success on stage, Petrillo struggled with addiction throughout his life. He credited his wife, Pat, with helping him overcome his addictions and stay on the path to recovery. In his later years, he became an advocate for addiction recovery and spoke openly about his own struggles. </p><p>While Petrillo's career may have been overshadowed by his legal battles with Jerry Lewis, he remains a beloved figure in the world of comedy. His impressions of Lewis and other comedic icons continue to entertain audiences today, and his contributions to the art form are celebrated by aspiring comedians around the world. Despite the ups and downs of his life and career, Sammy Petrillo remained a passionate and dedicated performer whose legacy continues to endure.</p><p>In addition to his work in entertainment, Sammy Petrillo was also a devoted family man. He was married to his wife Pat for over 50 years and had four children. Despite the challenges he faced throughout his life, he remained dedicated to his family and was known for his warmth and generosity. His son Mark described him as a "loving father" who always put his family first.</p><p>Petrillo's impact on the world of comedy is still felt today. He paved the way for future comedians to develop their own unique voices and inspired a generation of impressionists. In 2004, he was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Las Vegas Comedy Festival. Even in his later years, he continued to perform and was always looking for new ways to challenge himself creatively.</p><p>Sammy Petrillo may have had a tumultuous career, but his legacy as a comedian and entertainer lives on. His enduring influence on the world of comedy is a testament to his talent and dedication, and his impact on the lives of those who knew him is a reminder of the importance of staying true to oneself and pursuing one's passions with passion and perseverance.</p><p></p><p>
