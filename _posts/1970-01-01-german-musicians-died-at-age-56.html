(February 17, 1798		Berlin-March 1, 1854			Berlin)


was
a German
philosopher.


					</p><p>Beneke is mostly known for his work in the field of psychology, where he proposed innovative ideas and philosophical approaches that strongly influenced later generations of scholars. His theories centered around the idea that human perception and thought are never really passive and objective, but are always influenced and shaped by individual experiences, emotions, and prejudices. </p><p>Furthermore, Beneke emphasized the importance of empirical investigation and observation in the study of the mind, something that was not widely practiced at the time. Throughout his career, he held several teaching positions at universities, including the University of Berlin, where he taught psychology and philosophy. </p><p>Aside from his academic work, Beneke was an active member of the political and social scene of his time, advocating for progressive reforms and social justice. He also wrote numerous articles on a range of philosophical and political topics, such as the nature of reality, the relationship between science and religion, and the role of government in society. Despite his groundbreaking ideas and contributions to the field, Beneke's work did not receive the recognition it deserved until several decades after his death.</p><p>In addition to his influential work in psychology, Friedrich Eduard Beneke also made significant contributions to the fields of aesthetics and literary criticism. He believed that literary works should be analyzed not just for their themes and meaning, but also for their stylistic and formal qualities. Beneke also promoted the idea that art and literature should strive to depict the true essence of human emotion and experience, rather than simply conforming to traditional conventions or censorship. This approach had a lasting impact on both academic study of literature and the artistic movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. Despite his many accomplishments, Beneke's life was not without personal struggles, including financial difficulties and a long battle with depression. He died in Berlin in 1854, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire scholars and thinkers to this day.</p><p>Beneke's early life was marked by tragedy, as both his parents died when he was young. As a result, he was raised by his grandmother and struggled with poverty throughout his youth. Nonetheless, he was able to obtain a good education and eventually pursued his intellectual interests in philosophy and psychology. Beneke was heavily influenced by the work of Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, but also drew on his own observations and experiences when developing his theories. He is often credited with pioneering the study of the unconscious mind and the concept of "stream of consciousness" in literature. </p><p>Beneke was also heavily involved in the political movements of his time, advocating for the rights of the working class and the abolition of slavery. He was an early supporter of the German unification movement and believed that a democratic and just society was only possible through the collaborative efforts of individuals and the state. However, his political views were often controversial and he faced criticism from both the conservative establishment and radical revolutionaries.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Beneke continued to pursue his academic and social interests throughout his life, and his work had a profound impact on the development of modern psychology, aesthetics, and literary theory. His emphasis on the importance of subjective experience and empirical investigation was a major departure from previous philosophical schools, and helped lay the groundwork for the psychological and social sciences as we know them today.</p><p></p><p>

(March 30, 1879		Naissaar-December 1, 1935			Hamburg)


was
a German
astronomer.


					</p><p>He is best known for inventing the Schmidt telescope, which allows for wide field views of faint objects. Schmidt received his PhD from the University of Berlin in 1904 and subsequently worked at numerous observatories, including the Hamburg Observatory, where he developed the eponymous telescope in the 1930s. In addition to his innovations in telescopes, Schmidt made significant contributions to the study of comets and discovered several of his own. He was a member of several prestigious scientific societies, including the Royal Astronomical Society, and was awarded multiple honors throughout his career. Schmidt's work has had a lasting impact on astronomy and his telescope remains an important tool for astronomers today.</p><p>Later in life, Bernhard Schmidt faced financial struggles and was often forced to work in several different positions at different observatories to make ends meet. Despite these challenges, he remained dedicated to his work and made important scientific contributions throughout his career. In addition to his work as an astronomer, Schmidt was also an accomplished illustrator and painter, and his drawings of comets and other astronomical phenomena are still admired for their accuracy and beauty. Schmidt's legacy continues to inspire astronomers and amateur stargazers alike, and his innovative telescope design remains one of the most important tools for modern astronomy.</p><p>Schmidt's interest in astronomy began at a young age when he witnessed the spectacular appearance of the great comet of 1882. Later, he became fascinated with telescopes and began to experiment with optical designs. His interest in comets led him to observe and study them extensively throughout his career, and he discovered several new comets as a result. In addition to his work in astronomy, Schmidt also contributed to the field of optics by developing a new type of lens that was later used in microscopes and cameras.</p><p>Schmidt's most significant contribution to astronomy was the development of the Schmidt telescope. This telescope design revolutionized the field of astrophotography by allowing for wide-field views of the night sky. The Schmidt telescope has since been used to discover thousands of new astronomical objects, including galaxies, clusters, and supernovae. Schmidt's design was so successful that it became the basis for many subsequent telescope designs, including the famous Hubble Space Telescope.</p><p>Despite his professional successes, Schmidt faced personal challenges throughout his life. He was a devoted family man and caring father, but he struggled to provide for his large family on his modest income. He also faced health problems, including chronic asthma, which made it difficult for him to work for extended periods of time. Despite these struggles, Schmidt remained committed to his work and continued to innovate and make important contributions to the field of astronomy until his death in 1935.</p><p></p><p>
