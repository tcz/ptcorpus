was
a Canadian
composer and conductor.


						</p><p>He studied at the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal and later in Paris with renowned composer Olivier Messiaen. Garant became known for his experimental and avant-garde approach to composition, incorporating electronic music and graphic notation into his works. He also founded the Société de musique contemporaine du Québec (SMCQ) in 1966, which aimed to promote new works by Canadian composers and has since become one of the leading new music organizations in the country. Through his work with the SMCQ, Garant helped to raise the profile of contemporary Canadian classical music both domestically and internationally. He received numerous awards and recognition during his career, including the Molson Prize in 1982 and a posthumous Governor General's Performing Arts Award in 1987. Despite his success, Garant struggled with depression and alcoholism, and ultimately took his own life in 1986.</p><p>Garant's legacy continues to live on today through his influential contributions to the Canadian classical music scene. He composed over 80 works throughout his career, including orchestral and choral pieces, as well as works for solo instruments and small ensembles. His use of graphic notation, which involves the use of unconventional symbols and visuals to convey musical ideas, was particularly groundbreaking and inspired a new generation of Canadian composers. In addition to his work as a composer, Garant was also an accomplished conductor, leading orchestras across Canada and Europe. His commitment to promoting new and experimental music led him to collaborate with many other artists, including choreographers, visual artists, and filmmakers. These collaborations helped to expand the reach of contemporary classical music and promote interdisciplinary artistic expression. Today, the SMCQ continues to champion new Canadian music and Garant's legacy as a composer and advocate for the arts remains an important part of the country's cultural history.</p><p>Garant's music has been described as daring and dynamic, with a focus on exploring new sounds and techniques. He was particularly interested in the possibilities offered by electronic music, using synthesizers and other electronic instruments to create unique and innovative sounds. Garant was also committed to promoting cultural diversity and incorporating elements of Quebec and Canadian culture into his work, including traditional folk music and First Nations-inspired themes. He was known for his passionate and intense conducting style, and his performances were often accompanied by expressive physical gestures.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Garant's personal struggles and tragic death remind us of the importance of supporting artists' mental health and wellbeing. His contributions to Canadian culture and music continue to inspire and influence new generations of composers and performers.</p><p>In addition to his work as a composer and conductor, Serge Garant was also an influential educator. He taught at various institutions including the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal, McGill University, and the Université de Sherbrooke. His pedagogical approach was characterized by his commitment to helping students develop their own unique voices and encouraging them to experiment with new musical ideas. Many of his former students have gone on to become successful composers and performers in their own right, and his influence on Canadian music education can still be seen today.</p><p>Garant's impact on the Canadian arts scene was further recognized in 2001, when the Canadian Music Centre established the Serge Garant Award. The award is given out biennially to promising young composers who demonstrate a commitment to experimental and innovative music-making. This award serves as a reminder of Garant's legacy and his enduring influence on contemporary Canadian classical music.</p><p></p><p>
