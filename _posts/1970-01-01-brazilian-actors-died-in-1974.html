Some of his most well-known plays include "Rasga Coração," "Oduvaldo Vianna Filho," and "A Alma Boa de Setsuan." In addition to his work in theater, Vianinha was also active in the Brazilian film industry, writing screenplays for films such as "O Caso dos Irmãos Naves" and "Todas as Mulheres do Mundo."
