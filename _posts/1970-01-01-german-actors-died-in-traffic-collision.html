							Robert Thoeren was born in Brno, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and grew up in Vienna. He began his career in the entertainment industry in the 1920s as an actor, appearing in several German and Austrian films. However, he is best known for his work as a screenwriter, having penned scripts for numerous films throughout the 1930s and 1940s. </p><p>Thoeren's most famous work as a screenwriter was the 1930 German film "Der Blaue Engel" (The Blue Angel), which starred Marlene Dietrich and was directed by Josef von Sternberg. The film catapulted Dietrich to international stardom and is considered a classic of German cinema. </p><p>However, Thoeren's career was cut short by World War II. He was of Jewish descent, and his work was banned by the Nazi regime. Thoeren fled to France in 1933 and then to the United States in 1939, where he continued to work as a screenwriter. </p><p>In 1946, Thoeren returned to Germany and resumed his career in the film industry. However, he struggled to regain his footing and never achieved the same level of success as he had before the war. Thoeren passed away in Munich in 1957 at the age of 54. Despite his contributions to German cinema, he remains relatively unknown outside of film circles.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=39485315" title="Wikipedia article about Robert Thoeren">Robert Thoeren on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swedish-actors-died-in-1963.html' title='Swedish actors died in 1963'><strong>Swedish actors died in 1963</strong> List of the top 4 Swedish actors who died in 1963</a></li><li><a href='/french-actors-died-in-2010.html' title='French actors died in 2010'><strong>French actors died in 2010</strong> List of the top 27 French actors who died in 2010</a></li><li><a href='/serbian-actors-died-in-2008.html' title='Serbian actors died in 2008'><strong>Serbian actors died in 2008</strong> List of the top 1 Serbian actors who died in 2008</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/brazilian-musicians-died-at-age-78.html' title='Brazilian musicians died at age 78'><strong>Brazilian musicians died at age 78</strong> List of the top 15 Brazilian music stars who died when they were 78</a></li><li><a href='/cameroonian-musicians-died-at-age-51.html' title='Cameroonian musicians died at age 51'><strong>Cameroonian musicians died at age 51</strong> List of the top 2 Cameroonian music stars who died when they were 51</a></li><li><a href='/italian-actors-died-in-illness.html' title='Italian actors died in Illness'><strong>Italian actors died in Illness</strong> List of the top 1 Italian actors who died in Illness</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
