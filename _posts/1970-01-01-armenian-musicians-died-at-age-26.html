was
an Armenian
personality.


					</p><p>Hagop Hagopian was a prominent leader of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA), a militant group which operated in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s. He was known for spear-heading several violent attacks against Turkish interests around the world in an effort to draw attention to the Armenian Genocide.</p><p>Hagopian was born in the city of Mosul in modern-day Iraq, but his family moved to Lebanon when he was a child. He studied at the American University of Beirut and became involved in the Armenian nationalist movement during his time there. In the 1970s, he joined ASALA and quickly rose through the ranks to become one of its leaders.</p><p>During his time with ASALA, Hagopian was responsible for a number of high-profile attacks, including the bombing of the Turkish Consulate-General in Paris in 1981, which killed one person and injured several others. He was eventually caught by Greek authorities in Athens in 1988 and was assassinated by an Armenian rival group while in police custody. The circumstances surrounding his death remain unclear to this day.</p><p>Despite his controversial actions with ASALA, Hagop Hagopian remains a divisive figure in Armenian history. To some, he is a hero who fought tirelessly for justice and recognition of the Armenian Genocide. To others, he is a terrorist who caused unnecessary harm and bloodshed. </p><p>It is important to note that Hagopian was not the only member of his family to become involved in ASALA. His brother, Vicken Hagopian, was also a member and was killed in a shootout with French police in 1985. </p><p>In addition to his militant activities, Hagopian was also a prolific writer and poet. He published several books and articles on Armenian history and culture and was deeply committed to preserving and promoting the Armenian language.

His early works often featured scenes of everyday life in the city, capturing the hustle and bustle of its streets and the diversity of its people.</p><p>In Hawaii, Manookian shifted his focus to capturing the natural beauty of the islands.

His art was characterized by bold colors and strong lines, and his skillful use of light and shadow created a sense of depth and atmosphere.</p><p>Although his life was cut short, Manookian's impact on the world of art was significant.
