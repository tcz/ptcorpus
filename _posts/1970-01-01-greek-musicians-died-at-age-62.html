(April 1, 1886		Rentina-May 22, 1948			Athens)


was
a Greek
politician, military officer and soldier.


					</p><p>He served as the Prime Minister of Greece from April 1941 to December 1941, during the Axis occupation of Greece in World War II. Prior to his appointment as Prime Minister, Tsolakoglou had a distinguished military career, serving as a general in the Greek Army and participating in several battles during the Balkan Wars and World War I. After the German invasion of Greece in 1941, he became a collaborator with the Axis powers and was appointed as the head of the Greek puppet government. Despite his collaboration with the occupying forces, he continued to be respected by some parts of Greek society as he was seen as a patriot who had tried to protect the country from further destruction. After the war, he was arrested and tried for collaboration, and was sentenced to death. He was executed by firing squad in Athens in 1948.</p><p>Georgios Tsolakoglou was born on April 1, 1886, in Rentina, a small village in northern Greece. After completing his military education in Greece and France, he rose through the ranks of the Greek Army to become a general. Tsolakoglou played an active role in Greece's military campaigns in the Balkan Wars and World War I, and was highly regarded for his leadership skills and bravery on the battlefield.</p><p>However, his reputation was tarnished when he became the Prime Minister of Greece in April 1941, during the Axis occupation of Greece. Tsolakoglou, along with other Greek collaborators, helped the occupying German forces implement their plans for Greece and facilitated the deportation of Greek Jews to concentration camps. He was widely criticized for his role in the puppet government, which was seen as a betrayal of the country's sovereignty and independence.</p><p>After the end of World War II, Tsolakoglou was arrested and tried for collaboration with the enemy. He was found guilty and sentenced to death, despite his defense arguments that he had acted in the best interests of the Greek people. Although Tsolakoglou was a controversial figure, some Greeks remembered him as a patriot who had tried to minimize the damage caused by the war and occupation. He was executed by firing squad in Athens on May 22, 1948, and remains a divisive figure in Greek history to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(October 18, 1923		Athens-November 4, 1985			Paris)

	
		also known as Ado Kyrou or Adonis Kyrou

	
was
a Greek
film director, screenwriter and author.


					</p><p>Kyrou was one of the most prominent filmmakers of the Greek Cinema of the 1950s and 1960s, known for his avant-garde style and use of surrealism. He studied film in France, and his films often tackled themes of European politics, philosophy, and literature. In addition to his films, Kyrou was also a prolific author and wrote several books on cinema and the surrealists. He was a close associate of the French surrealist movement, and his work was featured in several of their publications. After his death in 1985, Kyrou's influence on Greek and European cinema continued to be felt, as his films were rediscovered and his ideas on film and surrealism continued to be discussed and debated.</p><p>Kyrou began his film career as a critic and writer for film magazines in both Greece and France, and he produced his directorial debut Agaymeni Ypoga in 1954. The film showcased his unique style of filmmaking, featuring dreamlike visuals and unexpected transitions, and it earned him critical acclaim. Kyrou's next film, Le Testament d'Orphée (1960), was a collaborative effort with fellow surrealist filmmaker Jean Cocteau. The film delved deeper into Kyrou's fascination with surrealism and experimentation, and it remains a significant work in the surrealist canon. </p><p>Kyrou's other notable films include Les Amants de Montparnasse (1958), which chronicled the life of artist Modigliani, and To Teleftaio Psema (1960), which explored the themes of love and mortality. Kyrou's films were often controversial and he pushed the boundaries of Greek cinema, making them ahead of their time. Despite this, Kyrou never gained the same level of commercial success as some of his contemporaries, and he often struggled to fund his films. </p><p>During his career, Kyrou also became involved in politics, and he joined the Greek Communist Party in 1948. His political beliefs were reflected in his films, which often delved into themes of social justice and political upheaval. After the 1967 coup in Greece, Kyrou was forced to flee the country and he settled in Paris, where he continued to write and make films. </p><p>Kyrou's legacy continues to resonate in contemporary cinema, with his films serving as an inspiration for many experimental and avant-garde filmmakers. His contributions to the field of cinema and surrealism have been recognized through retrospectives and exhibitions around the world.</p><p></p><p>
