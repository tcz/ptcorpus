(April 5, 2015		Saffron Walden-April 13, 1978)


was
an English
engineer.


					</p><p>He was known for inventing the first umbrella stroller, for his work on the development of the Spitfire airplane, and for his creation of the Maclaren Clan tartan. After studying engineering at the University of Cambridge, Maclaren worked on projects such as the development of the Bristol Mercury engine used in the Spitfire.

Maclaren's legacy continues to live on through his inventions and contributions to the engineering and parenting industries.</p><p>Maclaren's innovative designs revolutionized the parenting industry and made traveling with young children much easier. He continued to improve on his stroller design, eventually creating the "umbrella" version that could fold up to fit in a small carrying case. Maclaren's engineering background also influenced his stroller design, as it was made with aircraft-grade aluminum and other durable materials.</p><p>Aside from his work on the Spitfire and the Maclaren stroller, he also worked on other military projects during his lifetime. Maclaren was awarded an OBE (Order of the British Empire) in 1948 for his services to the British war effort.</p><p>In addition to his professional accomplishments, Maclaren led an interesting personal life. He was an accomplished equestrian and competed in horse racing events. He was also a skilled woodworker and enjoyed creating furniture in his spare time. Maclaren married his wife, Denise, in 1945 and they had four children together.</p><p>Despite Maclaren's many successes, he tragically passed away at the age of 63 from a heart attack. However, his legacy lives on through his inventions and contributions to the parenting industry, making him a true trailblazer in his field.</p><p></p><p>

(December 8, 1894		Vila Viçosa-December 8, 1930			Matosinhos)


was
a Portuguese
poet.


					</p><p>She was born into an aristocratic family and was the fourth of seven siblings. Despite having a privileged upbringing, Espanca struggled with emotional turmoil throughout her life, including multiple failed marriages and mental health issues. </p><p>Espanca began writing poetry at a young age, and her first collection, "Livro de Mágoas" ("Book of Sorrows"), was published in 1919. Her work often explored themes of love, feminism, and existentialism, and she became known for her frank and powerful style. </p><p>Although she faced criticism and scandal for the frankness of her work, Espanca continued to write prolifically, publishing several more collections of poems in her lifetime. Today, she is considered one of Portugal's most important poets and a pioneer of modernist Portuguese poetry.</p><p>In addition to her writing, Florbela Espanca was also known for her activism. She was a supporter of women's rights and was involved in the Portuguese feminist movement. She also worked as a journalist and translated works of literature from other languages into Portuguese. Unfortunately, Espanca's struggles with mental health eventually led to her untimely death by suicide on her 36th birthday. Despite her short life, her legacy continues to inspire generations of Portuguese writers and readers, particularly her exploration of themes of love, death, and the human experience.</p><p>In addition to her poetry, Florbela Espanca also wrote essays and short stories. Some of her most famous works include "Charneca em Flor" ("The Flowering Heath"), "Livro de Sóror Saudade" ("Book of Sister Saudade"), and "As Máscaras do Destino" ("The Masks of Destiny"). She was also known for her passionate love letters, some of which were published posthumously.</p><p>Despite living in a time when women's voices were often silenced, Espanca fearlessly tackled controversial topics in her writing, including female sexuality and the constraints of societal norms. Her poetry often explored the inner emotional landscape of the human experience, and her vulnerability and honesty continues to resonate with readers today.</p><p>Espanca's life and work have been the subject of numerous books, films, and plays, and she has been celebrated as a feminist icon and a symbol of Portuguese romanticism. In Vila Viçosa, her birthplace, there is a museum dedicated to her life and work, and her face appears on the Portuguese 2 euro coin.</p><p></p><p>
