		a.k.a. Ivan Goran Kovacic

	
was
a Croatian
writer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his epic poem "Jama" ("The Pit"), which was inspired by the Partisan massacre in the town of Foča during World War II.

He was born into a family of impoverished farmers in the small village of Lukovdol, in the western Balkans. Despite his humble beginnings, Kovačić showed a great love for literature from a young age and was recognized as a gifted writer by his teachers.</p><p>During World War II, Kovačić joined the Partisan resistance and fought against the Nazi regime in Yugoslavia.

was
a Croatian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a journalist and political emigrant, known for his criticism of the Yugoslav regime under Josip Broz Tito. Đureković fled to Germany in 1982 and continued to work for the Croatian nationalist cause. However, in 1983, he was assassinated by the Yugoslav secret police, UDBA, and his body was found in a car trunk in Wolfratshausen, Germany. His murder sparked international outrage and led to a strained relationship between Yugoslavia and Germany. In 2008, German authorities convicted two former UDBA agents of his murder in absentia.</p><p>Prior to his involvement in politics and journalism, Stjepan Đureković studied at the Faculty of Economics in Zagreb and worked as an engineer in the oil industry. He was also a member of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) political party. In addition to his political activities, Đureković was a prolific writer and published numerous articles on the topics of politics and economics, as well as two books.</p><p>Đureković's murder was among a series of political killings carried out by Yugoslav secret police on foreign soil. The assassination of Đureković was particularly shocking due to the brutality of the murder and the fact that it took place in Germany, a country that was considered safe for political refugees at the time. His death became a symbol of the repression of political emigrants and dissidents by the Yugoslav regime.</p><p>In addition to the convictions of the UDBA agents involved in his murder, the case of Stjepan Đureković has been the subject of ongoing investigations and inquiries.
