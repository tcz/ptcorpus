							He was born into a family of Italian immigrants and grew up in the city of Buenos Aires. He began his career as an actor in theater productions and later ventured into the fields of music and cinema. Discépolo is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of Argentine tango, having written some of the genre's most iconic songs, such as "Cambalache", "Uno", and "Malevaje". His work often dealt with themes of social injustice and political corruption, and he became known for his sharp critiques of Argentine society. In addition to his contributions to the arts, Discépolo was also involved in left-wing political activism and was a member of the Communist Party of Argentina. Despite his early success and widespread acclaim, he struggled with depression and alcoholism throughout his life and died at the age of 50. However, his legacy continues to be celebrated in Argentina and around the world, and his music and films remain beloved by audiences to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=2576665" title="Wikipedia article about Enrique Santos Discépolo">Enrique Santos Discépolo on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/egyptian-actors-died-in-1984.html' title='Egyptian actors died in 1984'><strong>Egyptian actors died in 1984</strong> List of the top 1 Egyptian actors who died in 1984</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-actors-born-in-1997.html' title='Canadian actors born in 1997'><strong>Canadian actors born in 1997</strong> List of the top 12 Canadian actors who were born in 1997</a></li><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-old-age.html' title='American actors died in Old age'><strong>American actors died in Old age</strong> List of the top 1 American actors who died in Old age</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/norwegian-actors-born-in-1956.html' title='Norwegian actors born in 1956'><strong>Norwegian actors born in 1956</strong> List of the top 6 Norwegian actors who were born in 1956</a></li><li><a href='/argentine-musicians-died-at-age-70.html' title='Argentine musicians died at age 70'><strong>Argentine musicians died at age 70</strong> List of the top 15 Argentine music stars who died when they were 70</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-musicians-died-in-hanging.html' title='Canadian musicians died in Hanging'><strong>Canadian musicians died in Hanging</strong> List of the top 1 Canadian music stars who died in Hanging</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
