personality.


					</p><p>Grinling Gibbons was a renowned British sculptor and woodcarver of Dutch origin, widely considered as one of the most talented woodcarvers of the 17th century. He is best known for his intricate carvings of foliage, fruit, and flowers in wood, which adorned many of the grandest buildings of his time, including St. Paul's Cathedral and Hampton Court Palace. His work was in high demand among wealthy patrons and royal households, and his unique style had a lasting impact on English decorative arts. Aside from carving, Gibbons also worked as an architect, designer, and painter. He lived and worked in England for most of his life, eventually obtaining British citizenship in 1693.</p><p>Gibbons began his education as an artist in the Netherlands before moving to England in early adulthood where his skills quickly gained him recognition. Among his most celebrated works are the carvings on the choir screen of Saint James's Church, Piccadilly, and his elaborately carved display of fruit and flowers at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire. His carvings were not limited to wood; he also created intricate carvings on stone and marble. </p><p>In addition to his art, Gibbons was also known for his impressive stonework and was commissioned to create extravagant heraldic monuments and fireplace surrounds for estates of the English aristocracy. He had the honour of being appointed as the "Master Carver in Wood" to the King, a position which he held until his death.</p><p>Although Gibbons' exact methods are not well-documented, his influence on later generations of woodcarvers was profound. His signature style, characterised by an intricate and naturalistic rendering of leaves and fruits, became known as the "Gibbons style" and was widely replicated. His work continues to be admired to this day, and examples of his beautiful carvings can be found in many institutions, including the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.</p><p></p><p>
