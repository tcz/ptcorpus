(July 11, 1899		Elst, Gelderland-October 10, 1943			Heemstede)

	
		otherwise known as Frederik Carel Kuipers

	
was
a Dutch
personality.


					</p><p>He served as a member of the Dutch resistance during World War II, where he played an important role in helping Jews escape from the Nazis. Frits Kuipers was a lawyer by profession and prior to the war, he was actively involved in the Dutch Christian Historical Party. He was a fervent opponent of Nazi philosophy and openly criticized the ideology of National Socialism. Due to his anti-Nazi stance, Frits Kuipers was arrested by the Gestapo in 1941 and imprisoned in Scheveningen and later in Vught concentration camps. He was ultimately executed in 1943 after being found guilty of conspiracy against the Third Reich. Frits Kuipers is remembered as a brave resistance fighter who risked his life to save others during one of the darkest periods in Dutch history.</p><p>During his time in prison, Frits Kuipers wrote extensively about his experiences and the plight of the Jewish community in the Netherlands. He smuggled out letters and notes that were later published and spread throughout the country, providing valuable insight into the reality of life in Nazi concentration camps. His writings continue to serve as a testament to his bravery and commitment to justice. After the war, Frits Kuipers was posthumously awarded the Dutch Resistance Memorial Cross for his heroism and sacrifice. In addition, his legacy has been honored with memorials and monuments throughout the country, including a plaque at the Scheveningen prison where he was held. His story has inspired countless others to stand up against injustice and persecution and to fight for a better world.</p><p>Frits Kuipers was born in Elst, Gelderland in the Netherlands on July 11, 1899. He grew up in a religious family and attended the University of Amsterdam, where he studied law. He began his professional career as a lawyer in Amsterdam and later moved to The Hague, where he established his own law firm. Kuipers was actively involved in the Dutch Christian Historical Party, a political party that advocated for confessionalism and conservatism.</p><p>In May 1940, the Nazis invaded and occupied the Netherlands. Kuipers was immediately vocal in his opposition to the Nazi regime and began working with the Dutch resistance to protect Jews and others who were persecuted by the Nazis. He helped create a network of safe houses throughout the country, where Jews could hide until they could be smuggled to safety.</p><p>In addition to his activities in the resistance, Kuipers continued to write extensively about the plight of the Jewish community in the Netherlands. He documented the atrocities committed by the Nazis and the conditions in the concentration camps. His writings were smuggled out of prison and later published as a book, "In Vught Gevangen", which was widely read in the Netherlands.</p><p>Despite his efforts, Kuipers was caught by the Nazis in 1941 and imprisoned in Scheveningen and later in Vught concentration camps. In 1943, he was found guilty of conspiracy against the Third Reich and executed. Kuipers was posthumously awarded the Dutch Resistance Memorial Cross for his heroism and sacrifice.</p><p>Today, Frits Kuipers is remembered as a courageous fighter against Nazi oppression and as a symbol of resistance to injustice. His legacy continues to inspire people around the world to stand up for what is right and to fight against tyranny and persecution.</p><p>Some other notable accomplishments of Frits Kuipers include his leadership in the creation of the Dutch Resistance Council, a group that coordinated the efforts of various resistance groups across the country. He worked closely with other prominent figures in the Dutch resistance, including Willem Arondeus and Gerrit Kastein. Kuipers also played a key role in the so-called "rommelroute" (junk route), a network of street markets where Jews could sell their possessions in order to secure money for their escape. Additionally, his law firm was used as a front for the resistance, providing a safe haven for those in need of assistance. Despite the danger of his work, Frits Kuipers remained dedicated to his cause and continued his resistance activities until his capture and ultimate execution. He remains a hero and an inspiration in the Netherlands and beyond.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1597		Scheveningen-October 31, 1641			São Tomé)


was
a Dutch
pirate.


					</p><p>Cornelis Jol, also known as "Houtebeen" or "Wooden Leg", was more famously known for his exploits as a corsair, a pirate operating with a letter of marque from a European government. He was commissioned by the Dutch West India Company and led successful expeditions against Spanish and Portuguese vessels in the Caribbean and along the coast of Brazil.</p><p>Jol's daring and ruthless tactics earned him a reputation as one of the most feared pirates of his time. He was known to attack heavily armed ships with a fraction of their firepower, using swift maneuvers and brutal force to overpower his opponents. He was also notorious for his treatment of prisoners, often subjecting them to torture and execution.</p><p>Despite his fearsome reputation, Cornelis Jol was a skilled navigator and strategist. He played a key role in the Dutch victory at the Battle of Matanzas in 1628, which saw the capture of a Spanish treasure fleet and the immense wealth it carried.</p><p>In addition to his exploits as a corsair, Jol was also a successful privateer, capturing English, French, and Danish ships on behalf of the Dutch. He amassed a substantial fortune from his plunder and was eventually appointed Admiral of the Dutch fleet.</p><p>Jol's career was cut short when he contracted malaria while on an expedition to capture the Portuguese island of São Tomé. He died on October 31, 1641, at the age of 44, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most feared and successful pirates in history.</p><p>Cornelis Jol was born in Scheveningen, a seaside village in the Dutch province of South Holland. He grew up in a family of fishermen and sailors, and at a young age, he began working on ships as a sailor. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a skilled navigator and sailor.</p><p>In 1623, Cornelis Jol was commissioned by the Dutch West India Company as a corsair, a privateer who operated with a letter of marque from the Dutch government. Jol's mission was to disrupt the Spanish and Portuguese shipping routes in the Caribbean and along the coast of Brazil. He was highly successful in his mission, and his reputation as a fearsome and ruthless pirate began to spread.</p><p>Jol's most famous exploit was the Battle of Matanzas in 1628, where he played a key role in the Dutch victory over Spanish forces. The battle was one of the most significant naval engagements of the 17th century, and Jol's leadership and tactical skills were critical in securing the Dutch victory.</p><p>Aside from his exploits as a corsair and privateer, Jol was also a successful trader, businessman, and farmer. He used his wealth and influence to support Dutch colonisation efforts in the Americas and the Caribbean.</p><p>Despite his fearsome reputation, Jol was also known for his kindness and generosity. He was respected and admired by his crew and was often praised for his leadership and bravery in battle.</p><p>Cornelis Jol's legacy as a pirate and privateer has endured for centuries. He remains a popular figure in literature and popular culture, and his exploits continue to fascinate scholars and historians.</p><p>Jol's reputation as a pirate was largely due to his tactics of surprise attacks and brutal treatment of prisoners. He was known to use psychological warfare, such as hoisting false flags to lure his victims into a false sense of security, before launching ferocious attacks. He was also feared for his use of brutal methods to extract information from prisoners, often resorting to torture and mutilation. Despite this, he was also known to be generous to his crew and share his wealth with them, which earned him their loyalty and admiration.</p><p>Jol's legacy as a pirate was not limited to his military exploits. He was also credited with contributing to the development of the Dutch economy and its trade relations with the New World. He was instrumental in establishing Dutch settlements in Brazil and Curaçao, and played a key role in securing their economic and political stability. His success as a privateer and trader made him one of the wealthiest men in the Dutch Republic, and his fortune allowed him to invest in various businesses, including shipbuilding and agriculture.</p><p>Jol's death at the age of 44 was a blow to the Dutch West India Company, which had relied on his expertise and leadership to maintain its dominance in the region. Nevertheless, his reputation as a pirate and privateer continued to inspire Dutch sailors for generations, and his exploits were celebrated in songs, stories, and popular culture. Despite his controversial character, Cornelis Jol remains an iconic figure in the history of piracy, and his legacy continues to fascinate and captivate people around the world.</p><p>Jol's name, "Houtebeen" or "Wooden Leg", comes from the injury he sustained during a battle in 1639 in which he lost his leg. Despite this setback, he continued to lead his men until his death two years later. Jol's prosthetic leg was said to be made of silver and adorned with jewels, reflecting his wealth and status.</p><p>Jol was married twice and had several children. His second wife, Maria, was the sister of fellow corsair and privateer Jan Janszoon. Jol's son, Laurens Cornelis Jol, followed in his father's footsteps and became a successful naval officer and privateer.</p><p>Despite his controversial actions, Jol has been praised for his strategic thinking and the impact he had on the Dutch Golden Age. His success as a privateer and his contributions to Dutch colonisation efforts helped to enrich the Dutch economy and establish its dominance in the region. Today, Jol is remembered as a legendary figure in the history of piracy, and his legacy continues to inspire historians and entertain audiences around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(January 16, 1900		Aachen-January 6, 1945			Auschwitz concentration camp)

	
		also known as Edith Frank-Hollander or Edith Holländer

	
was
a Dutch
personality.


					
			
		Her children
		are
		
		Anne Frank and Margot Frank.

						</p><p>Edith Frank was born in Aachen, Germany and grew up in a wealthy Jewish family. She married Otto Frank in 1925 and together they had two daughters, Anne and Margot. In 1933, when Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, the Franks decided to move to Amsterdam, Netherlands where Otto set up a business. </p><p>In 1940, the Nazis invaded the Netherlands and the Franks went into hiding in a secret annex behind their business premises along with another family and a dentist. Edith was a quiet woman who kept to herself but was very loving towards her daughters. She tried to maintain a sense of normalcy for them during their time in hiding but suffered greatly from the cramped living conditions and lack of privacy.</p><p>After being betrayed, the Franks were arrested on August 4, 1944 and sent to concentration camps. Edith Frank was first sent to Auschwitz and then to another camp called Bergen-Belsen. She died just days before the camp was liberated by British forces in January 1945, from starvation and exhaustion. Her husband Otto was the only one of the family to survive the concentration camps. After the war, he discovered his daughter Anne's diary and published it as a book which became a best-seller and has since been translated into over 70 languages.</p><p>Edith Frank became ill shortly after arriving at Auschwitz and was moved to the camp's infirmary. There she was subjected to cruel medical experiments by camp doctor Josef Mengele. Despite this, she managed to maintain hope and wrote letters to her husband and daughters, which were smuggled out of the camp. Sadly, the letters were never delivered as both Anne and Margot died in other concentration camps. Otto Frank, who was liberated by Soviet forces, returned to Amsterdam in June 1945 to discover that his family had perished. He dedicated the rest of his life to spreading his daughter's message of hope and peace through the publication of her diary and the establishment of the Anne Frank Foundation. Today, Edith Frank is remembered as a loving wife and mother who endured great suffering but never lost hope.</p><p>During her time in the secret annex, Edith kept a diary of her own, but unfortunately, it was lost before the family's arrest. However, the entries from her diary were later reconstructed through letters she wrote and sent to her own mother prior to their capture. In these letters, she writes about the difficulties of living in hiding but also the love she had for her family and her unwavering faith in God. </p><p>Edith had a strong sense of family and instilled that in her daughters, whom she homeschooled during their time in hiding. She taught them literature, history, and math while also encouraging their love for writing and reading. </p><p>In 1995, a monument to Edith Frank was erected in the Netherlands in her honor. The monument is a sculpture of a loving mother embracing her children and serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by Edith and many others during one of the darkest periods in human history.</p><p>Edith Frank's legacy continues to impact people today. Her story and that of her daughter Anne, serve as a reminder of the importance of standing up against injustice, discrimination and hatred. Edith's unwavering love for her family and her faith in God, in the face of such horrific circumstances, serves as an inspiration to many. Her diary entries, reconstructed through letters, provide insight into the difficulties faced by families in hiding during the Holocaust. The Anne Frank Foundation, established by Otto Frank, continues to educate people about the dangers of discrimination and the importance of peace and tolerance. The diary of Anne Frank has become a symbol of hope for future generations, as it chronicles the strength, resilience, and indomitable spirit of a young girl in dark times.</p><p></p><p>
						She died as a result of starvation.
