(December 14, 1875		Tondo-May 26, 1956			Paco, Manila)


was
a Filipino
personality.


					</p><p>She is best known as the older sister of the Philippine revolutionary leader Andres Bonifacio, and for her own contributions to the Philippine Revolution. Espiridiona Bonifacio played a crucial role in supporting and financing the revolutionary movement led by her brother, and is sometimes referred to as the "Mother of Katipunan." She was also involved in organizing relief efforts for Filipino prisoners and their families during the Philippine-American War. Despite her contributions to the revolution, Espiridiona Bonifacio suffered from poverty and illness throughout her life. She passed away in 1956 at the age of 80.</p><p>Espiridiona Bonifacio was born to Santiago Bonifacio and Catalina de Castro in Tondo, Manila. She was the eldest among the six siblings which include her more famous brother Andres Bonifacio. Little is known about Espiridiona's early life, except that she was present and actively supported her brother's revolutionary activities, the Katipunan. She was known to have been involved in fundraising and contributed to the expenses associated with the revolution.</p><p>During the Philippine-American War, Espiridiona organized the Sanguniang Bayan, a women's organization that provided relief efforts and assistance to Filipino prisoners and their families. Together with Marina Dizon and Marina Baja, Espiridiona visited imprisoned revolutionaries and brought them food and other basic necessities, and provided logistical support to the general movement. </p><p>Despite her significant contributions to the movement, Espiridiona and her family struggled with poverty and their situation became worse after the death of Andres Bonifacio. She reportedly lived a hard and lonely life after his death and received little recognition for her efforts. It was not until in recent years that her role in the revolution was acknowledged and celebrated.</p><p>Today, Espiridiona Bonifacio is remembered as one of the unsung heroes of the Philippine Revolution for her selflessness, sacrifice and unwavering support to the cause of freedom and independence.</p><p>In addition to her involvement in the revolutionary movement and relief efforts, Espiridiona Bonifacio was also known for her skills in traditional medicine. She was often called upon by the community to treat illnesses and injuries, and her remedies were highly sought after. This earned her the nickname "Apo Espiritu," a term of respect for elders in Filipino culture. Despite her lack of formal education, she was highly respected by her peers for her wisdom and knowledge.</p><p>Espiridiona's life was not without tragedy. She lost her husband, Gervacio Carreon, during the revolution and three of her children died at a young age. Her surviving children also faced poverty and struggled to make ends meet. Despite these challenges, Espiridiona remained committed to the revolutionary cause and continued to support the movement until the end of her life.</p><p>Today, Espiridiona Bonifacio is recognized as a significant figure in Philippine history and her contributions to the revolution are celebrated. Her legacy serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by ordinary Filipinos in the fight for independence and freedom.</p><p></p><p>
