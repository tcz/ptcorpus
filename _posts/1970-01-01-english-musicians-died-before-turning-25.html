		also known as Elizabeth Arnold Poe or Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe

	
was
an English
theater actress and actor.


					
			
		Her children
		are
		called
		Edgar Allan Poe, William Henry Leonard Poe and Rosalie Mackenzie Poe.

						</p><p>Eliza Poe was born into a family of actors and was raised to follow in their footsteps. She traveled extensively throughout the United States and made her debut in Boston in 1806. She met and married David Poe Jr., also an actor, in 1806 and together they had three children. However, David Poe Jr. abandoned the family in 1810, leaving Eliza to raise their children on her own.</p><p>Eliza Poe struggled to support her family and eventually fell ill with tuberculosis. She died in December of 1811, leaving her children to be split up among different relatives. This event had a profound impact on her son Edgar Allan Poe, who would later become one of the most famous writers in American history. Poe would often mention his mother in his writings, describing her as his "angel mother" who watched over him from beyond. Despite her short life and struggles, Eliza Poe's legacy lives on through her famous son's work.</p><p>Eliza Poe's legacy also impacted the literary world as she inspired many of Edgar Allan Poe's famous works such as "The Raven" and "Annabel Lee". Her husband's abandonment and her struggle to provide for her family also influenced Poe's writing on the theme of loss, grief, and poverty. Eliza Poe's talent as an actress and her dedication to her children continue to be remembered and celebrated, and her story serves as a reminder of the struggles and sacrifices that many women faced during the 19th century. Today, she is often recognized as a key figure in shaping the life and work of her famous son, Edgar Allan Poe.</p><p></p><p>

was
an English
personality.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		James VI and I.

						</p><p>Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley was a significant figure in Scottish and English history. He was the second husband of the infamous Mary, Queen of Scots, whom he married in 1565. As the son of Matthew Stuart, 4th Earl of Lennox, his marriage to Mary, Queen of Scots was seen as a strategic move to strengthen his family's claim to the Scottish throne. </p><p>However, Darnley's marriage to Mary was a turbulent one. He was known for his vanity, arrogance, and violent temper. He often clashed with Mary's advisers, particularly her trusted friend and advisor, David Rizzio. It was rumored that he had a hand in Rizzio's murder, which led to a breakdown in his marriage and increased tensions between Mary and her subjects.</p><p>Darnley's own life was cut short in a brutal manner when he was assassinated in his lodgings at Kirk o' Field in 1567. Although it remains unclear who was responsible for his murder, it is widely believed that Mary's second husband, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, played a role. Darnley's death effectively marked the end of Mary's reign and forever cemented his place in history as a tragic figure.</p><p>Darnley's assassination was a turning point in the history of Scotland, leading to a series of events that ultimately led to Mary's own downfall. Despite his tumultuous life, Darnley is remembered for his role in producing an heir to the Scottish throne, James VI and I, who would go on to rule England and Scotland. James' mother, Mary, was forced to abdicate the Scottish throne shortly after Darnley's murder, and he was declared King of Scotland in 1567. James' rule would bring about significant changes in English and Scottish politics, including the union of the two kingdoms under a single monarch. While Darnley's life was short and turbulent, his legacy would continue to shape the course of British history for centuries to come.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in assassination.
