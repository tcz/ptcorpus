							Veit Harlan's career as a filmmaker began in the early 1930s, and he earned much critical acclaim for his work during the Nazi era. He was particularly known for his propaganda films, including "Jud Süss", which has been widely criticized for its anti-Semitic themes. After World War II, Harlan was brought to trial for his association with the Nazi regime, but was acquitted due to lack of evidence. He continued to work in the film industry, producing and directing numerous films throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. Despite his success as a filmmaker, Harlan's legacy has been overshadowed by his controversial past and his association with the Nazi propaganda machine. Today, his work is viewed through a critical lens, and many of his films are considered problematic due to their use of racist and anti-Semitic themes.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=870163" title="Wikipedia article about Veit Harlan">Veit Harlan on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Lothar Müthel</h2><p><strong>Lothar Müthel</strong>
