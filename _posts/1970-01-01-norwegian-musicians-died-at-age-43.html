(April 19, 1910-September 4, 1953)


was
a Norwegian
personality.


					</p><p>Magdalon Monsen was a Norwegian aviator, painter, and explorer. He is best known for his numerous record-breaking flights across the Arctic regions. In addition to his passion for flying, Monsen was also an accomplished painter and exhibited his works in a number of galleries across Europe. During his expeditions, he would often document his experiences through sketches and paintings. Monsen's expeditions were not without danger, as he experienced numerous near-misses and had to overcome harsh weather conditions, but his adventures captured the imagination of people across the world. Unfortunately, Monsen's life was cut short when his plane crashed in the wilderness of Northern Canada in 1953.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Magdalon Monsen left a lasting legacy as a pioneer of Arctic aviation and exploration. His contributions to the field of aviation and his artistic talent continue to inspire people around the world today. Monsen was posthumously awarded the King's Medal for Courage in the Cause of Freedom, and his memory is honored by the Magdalon Monsen Memorial Fund, which supports Norwegian artists and scientists. His artwork, which often depicted the Arctic landscapes he explored during his flights, is still highly regarded today and can be found in collections around the world. Despite his successes and accomplishments, Monsen remained humble and dedicated to his passion for flying and painting throughout his life.</p><p>Monsen's love for aviation began at a young age, and he began taking flying lessons when he was just fifteen years old. He received his pilot's license in 1930 and went on to set numerous records for Arctic flying, including the first non-stop flight from Norway to the United States via the North Pole in 1935. In addition to his flying and painting, Monsen was also an experienced mountaineer and skier. He often combined his talents and would paint scenes from his aerial expeditions while on the ground during his mountaineering and skiing adventures. </p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Monsen was known for his modesty and shyness. He was said to be uncomfortable with the attention he received for his exploits, and often preferred solitude and introspection. In his own words, "I am not a hero, I am just a man who likes to fly." </p><p>Today, Monsen's legacy lives on in numerous ways. In addition to the memorial fund established in his honor, there is also a mountain in Antarctica named after him, Mount Monsen. His records for Arctic flying continue to inspire modern-day aviators, and his artwork remains a testament to his enduring love for the Arctic wilderness.</p><p>Monsen's accomplishments were not just limited to his record-breaking flights and artistic talent. He also made significant contributions to the field of meteorology, conducting experiments and taking measurements during his expeditions. He was particularly interested in the formation and behavior of ice, and his research has helped deepen our understanding of the Arctic region. Monsen also contributed to the Allied efforts during World War II, serving as a transport pilot and helping to deliver supplies to Allied forces in Europe. Despite his contributions to the war effort, Monsen remained committed to his principles of pacifism and was deeply affected by the war's devastating impact on civilians. In his later years, he became increasingly disillusioned with humanity's destructive behavior towards the natural world and spoke out against environmental degradation. Today, Monsen's message of respect for the natural world remains as relevant as ever, and his legacy as a pioneer of Arctic aviation and exploration continues to inspire generations.</p><p>Monsen's passion for flying and adventure began at a young age, as he grew up near a seaplane base in his hometown of Horten, Norway. Inspired by the sight of planes taking off and landing, Monsen was determined to become a pilot himself. He worked odd jobs to save up enough money for flying lessons, and his dedication paid off when he received his pilot's license at the age of 20. </p><p>In addition to his feats in aviation and art, Monsen was also a polyglot who spoke several languages fluently. He used his language skills to communicate with indigenous communities during his expeditions, earning their trust and cooperation. Monsen also had a keen interest in history and was particularly fascinated by the Viking Age. He often incorporated Norse themes and motifs into his artwork, and even flew a replica Viking longship during one of his expeditions.</p><p>Despite his adventurous spirit, Monsen remained a deeply introspective and philosophical person. He was known to journal extensively, and his writings reveal a deep concern for the environment and humanity's impact on the planet. Monsen was also a devoted family man, and his wife and children were always his top priority. </p><p>Today, Monsen is remembered as a true Renaissance man whose talents and accomplishments transcended traditional boundaries. His legacy continues to inspire adventurers, artists, and scientists alike, reminding us of the endless possibilities that await those who are willing to embrace curiosity, creativity, and courage.</p><p>In addition to his other accomplishments, Magdalon Monsen was also a humanitarian who worked tirelessly to improve the lives of those less fortunate. During his expeditions, he would often bring medical supplies and other essentials to remote communities in the Arctic region. He also used his influence to raise awareness about social and environmental issues, advocating for the protection of endangered species and habitats. Monsen's dedication to humanitarian causes earned him the respect and admiration of people across the world, and his legacy as a compassionate and empathetic individual continues to inspire acts of kindness and generosity today. Despite his untimely death, Monsen's impact on the world was profound and enduring, and his courage, creativity, and compassion serve as an inspiration to us all.</p><p></p><p>
