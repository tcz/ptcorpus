(November 6, 1890		Žagarė-June 10, 1943			Dublin)


was
a Lithuanian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a Jewish-American labor leader, political activist, and lawyer who played an important role in the US labor movement during the first half of the 20th century. Bookman was born in the town of Žagarė, then part of the Russian Empire (now in Lithuania), and emigrated to the United States with his family in 1904. He became involved in the trade union movement and was a founding member of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Bookman served as general counsel for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and was an advocate for workers' rights, particularly in the transportation industry. He was also involved in left-wing politics, including the Socialist Party of America and the Communist Party. Bookman was indicted under the Smith Act during World War II and died in Dublin, Ireland, while trying to evade extradition to the United States.</p><p>In addition to his involvement in the labor movement, Louis Bookman was also a prominent lawyer. He received a law degree from New York Law School in 1914 and went on to represent many labor unions and their members. Bookman was known for his passionate defense of workers' rights and his belief in the importance of collective bargaining. He also served as counsel for several high-profile cases, including the trial of Tom Mooney, a labor organizer who was wrongfully convicted of a bombing in San Francisco in 1916. Bookman's advocacy for Mooney helped to garner widespread support for his release.</p><p>Bookman's political activism also extended to international affairs. He was a vocal opponent of fascism and Nazism and was involved in efforts to aid Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in Europe. During the Spanish Civil War, he supported the Republican government and worked to provide aid to the Spanish people. Bookman also traveled to the Soviet Union several times and was a staunch defender of the Soviet government.</p><p>Despite his dedication to workers' rights and progressive causes, Louis Bookman was not immune to controversy. His membership in the Communist Party and his advocacy for Soviet-style socialism drew criticism and condemnation from many quarters, and he was targeted by government officials during the Red Scare of the 1940s. Bookman's indictment under the Smith Act was one example of this persecution, although he managed to evade extradition to the United States and lived out the rest of his days in Dublin, Ireland.</p><p></p><p>
