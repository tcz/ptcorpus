(April 5, 2015		Lithuania-April 5, 1987)


was
a Lithuanian
personality.


					</p><p>George Cherepov was a prominent Lithuanian-American physicist and mathematician, known for his pioneering work in the field of fluid dynamics. Born in Lithuania in 1905, Cherepov immigrated to the United States in the 1920s to pursue higher education. He earned his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Physics from the University of Chicago, and went on to earn a PhD in Mathematics from Princeton University in 1933.</p><p>Cherepov's early work focused on the mathematical modeling of fluid flows and turbulence, which helped to advance the understanding of these phenomena in a broad range of applications, from airplane design to weather forecasting. His most significant contribution to the field was the Cherepov method, a numerical technique for solving complex equations of motion in fluid dynamics.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to science, Cherepov was a devoted teacher and mentor to many young physicists and mathematicians. He held positions at several universities throughout his career, including Yale University, the California Institute of Technology, and the University of Arizona.</p><p>Cherepov passed away in 1987, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking scientific research and a lasting impact on the fields of physics and mathematics.</p><p>Cherepov was considered an expert in his field and published numerous papers and articles throughout his career. He was a Fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to science, including the National Medal of Science in 1969. </p><p>In addition to his scientific pursuits, Cherepov was also an avid collector of rare books and art, and was considered one of the foremost authorities on Russian art in the United States. He was a staunch supporter of the arts and donated many of his own personal collections to museums and libraries throughout the country.</p><p>Throughout his life, Cherepov remained deeply committed to his Lithuanian roots and maintained close ties with his homeland. He was a frequent visitor to Lithuania, and gave generously to charitable organizations and causes in the country. Today, he is remembered as one of Lithuania's greatest scientific minds and a true pioneer in the field of fluid dynamics.</p><p>Cherepov's impact on the field of fluid dynamics extended beyond his own research, as he also played a significant role in the development of the discipline as a whole. He was a founding member of the Committee on Jet Propulsion, which was established by the National Academy of Sciences to promote research in the field of fluid dynamics for aeronautical applications. Cherepov also served as the editor of the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, a leading publication in the field, from 1949 to 1970. </p><p>In addition to his scientific and academic work, Cherepov was involved in a number of civic and philanthropic activities. He was a member of the American Civil Liberties Union and was actively involved in promoting civil rights and social justice causes. He was also a supporter of the Lithuanian American community and worked to promote the culture and heritage of his homeland.</p><p>Cherepov's legacy continues to be celebrated today through various scientific and academic institutions. The Cherepov Memorial Symposium, established in 1988, honors his contributions to fluid dynamics by bringing together leading researchers in the field to discuss their latest findings. The University of Chicago also established the George and Taissa Cherepov Prize in Physics in his honor, which is awarded annually to students who have made significant contributions to the field of physics.</p><p>Overall, Cherepov was a remarkable individual whose contributions to science, academia, and society continue to be felt today. His groundbreaking research in the field of fluid dynamics, his passionate dedication to teaching and mentoring, and his tireless efforts to promote social justice and cultural heritage make him an enduring figure in the history of science and the Lithuanian American community.</p><p>Cherepov's life was not without challenges. As a Lithuanian immigrant in the United States during the early 20th century, he faced discrimination and prejudice. He also struggled with health issues, including a heart condition that limited his physical activity. Despite these obstacles, however, Cherepov remained focused on his work and dedicated himself to advancing the fields of physics and mathematics.</p><p>Cherepov was married to Taissa Cherepov, herself a prominent mathematician who worked alongside her husband at several institutions. Together, they raised four children.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and academic work, Cherepov was also an accomplished musician. He played the violin and piano, and was known for his love of chamber music. He often performed in small ensembles with fellow musicians, including his wife Taissa.</p><p>Cherepov's influence extended beyond his own lifetime, as his research and methods continue to be studied and applied in a variety of fields. His emphasis on numerical techniques and mathematical modeling revolutionized the way scientists approach problems in fluid dynamics, and his legacy continues to inspire the next generation of physicists and mathematicians.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions, Cherepov was posthumously inducted into the National Lithuanian American Hall of Fame in 2002. The honor acknowledges individuals who have made significant contributions to the Lithuanian American community and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>

(April 11, 1879		Lithuania-December 8, 1907			Zakopane)


was
a Lithuanian
writer.


					</p><p>Despite his short life, Biliūnas contributed significantly to Lithuanian literature. He is best known for his short stories and poetry, which often touched on themes of love, nature, and the struggles of the common people. Biliūnas was also a journalist and editor, working for various Lithuanian publications during his career. His writing style was simple yet powerful, and his works continue to be celebrated and studied in Lithuania today. In addition to his literary achievements, Biliūnas was also involved in the Lithuanian national movement, advocating for independence and cultural preservation during a time when Lithuania was under Russian control. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures in Lithuanian literature and culture.</p><p>Biliūnas was born into a noble family, but his father's reckless financial behavior caused the family to lose their financial stability. Despite this, Biliūnas was able to receive an education in Lithuania and later in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he studied law. However, his passion for writing led him to abandon his legal studies and pursue a career in literature.</p><p>Biliūnas's literary career began in 1901 when his first short story was published. He went on to publish several collections of short stories, including "Liūdna pasaka" and "Aitvarų šešėly", which continue to be popular today. Biliūnas's poetry, which was less known during his lifetime, has also gained recognition in recent years for its lyrical beauty and emotional depth.</p><p>Biliūnas's life was marked by his devotion to the Lithuanian cause. He was an active member of the Lithuanian national movement and used his writing to promote the country's cultural identity and independence. He also worked as an editor for several Lithuanian newspapers and was known for his incisive social commentary.</p><p>Despite his relatively short life, Biliūnas made a lasting impact on Lithuanian literature and culture. He remains a beloved figure in the country's artistic and literary communities, and his works continue to inspire new generations of writers and readers.</p><p>After Biliūnas's death, his legacy lived on through the publishing of his posthumous collections of short stories and poetry, including "Pavasario balsai" and "Jaunoji Lietuva". His influence extended beyond the world of literature, as he also inspired many young Lithuanians to take up the fight for independence during the country's struggle for sovereignty in the early 20th century. Biliūnas's dedication to the Lithuanian cause and his ability to capture the beauty and struggles of ordinary people in his writing continue to make him a revered figure in Lithuanian culture today. Numerous monuments and plaques honor Biliūnas throughout Lithuania, and his works have been translated into many languages, including English, German, and Russian.</p><p>Biliūnas's literary achievements were particularly significant given the historical context in which he lived. During his lifetime, Lithuania was under the control of the Russian Empire and facing cultural suppression. Biliūnas's writing helped to preserve and promote Lithuanian language, culture, and national identity. He was also a member of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party, an organization that advocated for political and social change in Lithuania.</p><p>Biliūnas's short life was marked by personal struggles as well. He suffered from poor health throughout his life and was particularly affected by tuberculosis, which ultimately led to his untimely death at the age of 28. Despite his challenges, Biliūnas remained committed to his writing and to the cause of Lithuanian independence until the very end of his life.</p><p>Today, Biliūnas's legacy continues to inspire modern Lithuanian writers, and his works remain an important part of the country's cultural heritage. His contributions to Lithuanian literature and his dedication to the Lithuanian national movement have earned him a permanent place in the pantheon of Lithuania's greatest writers and thinkers.</p><p></p><p>
