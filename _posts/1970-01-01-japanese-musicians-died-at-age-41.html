(September 7, 1903		Sapporo-August 17, 1945			Kamakura)


was
a Japanese
writer and novelist.


					</p><p>Despite passing away at a relatively young age of 41, Shimaki Kensaku wrote over 70 literary works and is considered one of the most influential Japanese writers of the pre-World War II era. Born in Sapporo, he was part of the generation of writers who responded to the rapid modernization of Japan during the Meiji era. After moving to Tokyo and working in various fields including journalism and advertising, he devoted himself to full-time writing. Kensaku is known for his realistic yet poetic writing style, often exploring themes of love, death, and existentialism. His most popular works include "The Broken Commandment" and "Farewell to the Woman". Kensaku's legacy continues to inspire contemporary Japanese writers and remains a significant figure in Japanese literature.</p><p>In addition to his prolific literary career, Shimaki Kensaku was also known for his involvement in leftist political movements during the 1930s. He was a member of the Japanese Communist Party and his writing frequently addressed social and political issues of the time, including poverty and inequality. Kensaku was arrested multiple times for his political activities and was briefly imprisoned in 1934. Despite this, he continued to write and advocate for leftist causes throughout his career. Today, he remains a beloved figure in Japan, and his works continue to be celebrated for their beauty, depth, and social commentary.</p><p>Kensaku's writing style was heavily influenced by his experiences in early life, particularly his upbringing in Hokkaido, a region that was still being colonized by the Japanese government during his childhood. This led him to have a unique perspective on the effects of modernization and colonization on Japanese society. His works often explored the themes of personal struggle and societal change, and the impact they had on individuals. </p><p>Kensaku was also a vocal critic of the militarist government of Japan during the World War II era. He openly opposed Japan's involvement in the war and was critical of the government's oppressive policies. In 1941, he was placed under surveillance by the government as part of its crackdown on dissenting voices. </p><p>Despite the challenges he faced, Kensaku continued to write until his death from tuberculosis in 1945, just a few weeks before Japan's surrender in World War II. Today, he is remembered not just for his contributions to Japanese literature, but also for his activism and the impact he had on social and political issues during a tumultuous time in Japanese history.</p><p></p><p>

(October 30, 1874		Tokyo-July 9, 1916)


was
a Japanese
writer.


					</p><p>Bin Ueda, born as Ueda Kikutaro, was a prominent writer of Japan's modern literature movement, which emerged in the late 19th century. He grew up in a well-to-do family, but his father's sudden death when he was only 15 brought the family fortunes to an end. This difficult experience of poverty and tragedy later served as inspirations for many of his works.</p><p>His early works were mostly light fiction, but they soon took a darker turn as he began to write about the struggles of the lower class in urban areas. His most famous works include "Born in a Ditch," "The Teahouse of the August Moon," and "In the Harbor," all of which deal with themes of poverty, social inequality, and the human condition.</p><p>Despite his short life, Ueda's works had a significant impact on Japanese literature and remain popular to this day. His unique style and powerful insights into the human experience have earned him a place among the prominent literary figures of Japan's modern era.</p><p>Ueda's writing was influenced by his experiences with poverty and tragedy which led him to deeply empathize with people living in lower-class conditions in urban areas. He was one of the pioneers of the literary style that was termed the "I-novel," which is an autobiographical account of the writer's personal experiences written in a fictionalized form. This style allowed Ueda to explore his own feelings and experiences in his writing, which lent a genuine quality to his works.</p><p>In addition to his writing career, Ueda was also an early supporter of socialism in Japan and took an active role in social and political movements of his time. He was a close friend of famous writer and political activist, Sakae Osugi, who was assassinated in 1923.</p><p>Ueda's life was cut short when he died of a lung disease at the young age of 41. However, his legacy as a writer and social activist continues to influence Japanese literature and culture to this day.</p><p>In fact, Ueda's influence extends beyond Japan, as his works have been translated into many languages and have been studied by scholars worldwide. His writing style, which blended realism and naturalism with a personal touch, was seen as groundbreaking at the time and has inspired generations of writers.</p><p>Despite his early support of socialism, Ueda's political beliefs evolved over the course of his life. He became disillusioned with the rigid ideology of Marxism and embraced a more humanistic approach to social justice. He believed that the key to a fair and just society was in the development of individual consciousness and self-awareness, which would lead to a greater sense of compassion and empathy among people.</p><p>Ueda's untimely death was a great loss to Japanese literature and society. However, his contributions to the modern literary movement and his advocacy for social justice continue to inspire people around the world.</p><p></p><p>

While in the United States, he was impressed by the principles of democracy and the modern education system, which inspired him to promote similar changes in Japan.
