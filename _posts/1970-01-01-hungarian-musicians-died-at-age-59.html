(April 22, 1876		Vienna-April 8, 1936			Uppsala)

	
		a.k.a. Robert Barany or Dr. Robert Bárány

	
was
a Hungarian
physician.


					</p><p>He received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1914 for his work in the physiology of the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear. His studies on the structure and function of the vestibular system greatly advanced the understanding of how the body maintains balance and orientation in space. Besides his groundbreaking work in medicine, Bárány was also an avid aviator and test pilot, and he was the first to propose the use of aircraft in medical rescue operations. Despite having to flee Austria during World War II due to his Jewish heritage, he continued to make significant contributions to medicine and aviation.</p><p>Bárány was a renowned professor of otology at the University of Uppsala, where he held the position for over two decades. During this time, he made pioneering contributions to the study of hearing and deafness, and his research further extended to ophthalmology and neurology, with a special focus on the brainstem. He was a prolific writer, publishing numerous papers and books on his research, and also contributed to the development of new techniques for examining the ear and its functions.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Bárány's life was not without challenges. He faced discrimination and persecution due to his Jewish background, and was forced to flee from Austria to Sweden, where he continued his work. He also survived the loss of two brothers, who perished in the Holocaust.</p><p>Today, Bárány is remembered as one of the most influential medical researchers of the 20th century, whose discoveries have paved the way for our understanding of the inner workings of the ear, and have benefited countless patients suffering from vestibular disorders. His achievements have also inspired generations of scientists and medical professionals, and his legacy continues to live on through the many lives he touched.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1070		Kingdom of Hungary-September 1, 1129			Constantinople)

	
		also known as Prince Almos or Álmos of Hungary

	
was
a Hungarian
personality.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Béla II of Hungary and Adelaide of Hungary.

						</p><p>Álmos was the son of King Géza I of Hungary and therefore the brother of the previous king, King Coloman. He was a member of the Árpád dynasty, which ruled Hungary from the 9th to the 14th century. </p><p>In his youth, Álmos participated in the wars against the Holy Roman Empire, where he gained military experience. After his father's death in 1077, his brother Coloman became the king of Hungary. Coloman appointed Álmos to be the Duke of Slavonia, a province located in present-day Croatia.</p><p>Álmos was known for his ambition to become king himself. He plotted against his brother and made a deal with the Byzantine Empire to gain their support for his claim to the throne. However, his plan was discovered, and Coloman had him arrested and blinded in 1108.</p><p>After his release, Álmos fled to Constantinople, where he lived in exile until his death in 1129. His son Béla II of Hungary eventually became king and established the Árpád dynasty as one of the most powerful in Europe.</p><p>During his time in Constantinople, Álmos was able to establish close relations with the Byzantine court and even married a member of the Byzantine aristocracy. He also became known for his cultural and intellectual engagement with the city, where he attended lectures and debates hosted by the local scholars. According to some sources, he even contributed to the work of the Byzantine scholar and theologian John Italos, who was an expert on Aristotle's philosophy.</p><p>Despite his exile, Álmos remained a prominent figure in Hungary and a potential threat to his brother's rule. Coloman treated his nephew Béla with suspicion and initially tried to limit his power. However, Béla eventually gained the support of the Hungarian nobility and was able to assert his claim to the throne. He reigned as a successful monarch for over thirty years, during which Hungary experienced economic, military, and cultural growth.</p><p>Today, Álmos is remembered as an important figure in Hungarian history, whose ambitions and conflicts contributed to the dynamics of the Árpád dynasty. His story has been the subject of many historical novels and plays, as well as academic research on medieval politics and culture.</p><p></p><p>

As a member of the opposition party, he frequently clashed with the ruling party over issues of workers' rights, land reform, and national identity. He was a staunch advocate for greater autonomy for Hungary within the Austro-Hungarian Empire and often criticized the government's policies toward minority groups such as the Slovaks and Romanians.</p><p>Despite his controversial views, Donáth remained widely respected as a cultural figure and was awarded numerous honors and awards during his lifetime. Today, he is remembered as a passionate champion of democracy and social justice, whose tragic death served as a warning of the dangers of extremism and political violence.</p><p></p><p>
