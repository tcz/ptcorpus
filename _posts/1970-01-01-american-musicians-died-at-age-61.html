(June 8, 1910		Newark-July 11, 1971			Mountainside)

	
		also known as Arthur McCann, Don A. Stuart, John Wood Campbell Jr., Karl van Campen, John W. Campbell Jr., John Campbell or The Father of Modern Science Fiction

	
was
an American
writer, novelist and magazine editor.


					</p><p>Campbell was best known for his influence on the science fiction genre during his time as an editor of Astounding Science Fiction, which he edited from late 1937 until his death in 1971. During his tenure, he published works by many of the most influential science fiction authors of the time, including Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, and A.E. van Vogt. Campbell was also a prolific writer himself, publishing numerous stories and novels under the pen names Don A. Stuart and John W. Campbell Jr. He was a key figure in the development of modern science fiction, popularizing the concept of hard science fiction and helping to shift the genre away from traditional pulp-style adventure stories toward more thoughtful, character-driven narratives. Despite his contributions to the genre, Campbell's legacy has been somewhat tarnished by his controversial views on race and politics, which were often reflected in the stories he published in Astounding.</p><p>Campbell was born in Newark, New Jersey and grew up in a family that valued education and scientific inquiry. He attended MIT but was forced to drop out due to financial difficulties. He began his writing career in the 1930s, contributing stories to pulp magazines such as Amazing Stories and Unknown.</p><p>In 1937, Campbell was hired as the editor of Astounding Science Fiction, which was then a struggling publication. He quickly transformed the magazine, bringing in a new generation of writers and championing stories with a more serious tone and scientific accuracy. He coined the term "psi powers" to describe psychic abilities in science fiction, and popularized the idea of using scientific concepts as the basis for stories.</p><p>Campbell's influence on the genre was tremendous. He created an editorial approach known as the "Campbellian revolution," which emphasized scientific rigor and grounded storytelling. Many of the writers he published went on to become some of the most influential in the field, and the stories published in Astounding during his tenure are considered classics of the genre.</p><p>However, Campbell's legacy has been tarnished by his controversial views on race and politics. He was a staunch conservative and believed in eugenics, leading him to publish stories that were overtly racist and endorsed white supremacist ideology. He also had a tendency to insert his own ideas into the stories he published, sometimes to the detriment of the author's vision.</p><p>Despite these flaws, Campbell remains an important figure in the development of science fiction. His focus on scientific accuracy and thoughtful storytelling helped to elevate the genre and lay the groundwork for modern science fiction as we know it today.</p><p></p><p>

(March 13, 1855		Boston-November 12, 1916			Flagstaff)


was
an American
astronomer.


					</p><p>He was best known for his observations and theories of the planet Mars, and his efforts to popularize astronomy. Lowell was born into a prominent New England family and received a bachelor's degree from Harvard University. He became fascinated with astronomy and founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Lowell's observations led him to propose the existence of a planet beyond Neptune, which he called "Planet X". Although he never found it himself, the search for Planet X eventually led to the discovery of Pluto. Lowell was a prolific writer and speaker, and he authored several popular books on astronomy. He was also a proponent of the idea that Mars was inhabited by intelligent beings, and he championed this theory until his death. Despite this aspect of his legacy being discredited by later scientific findings, Lowell's contributions to the study of the solar system and his popularization of astronomy made him an important figure in the field.</p><p>Additionally, Lowell was a pioneer in using photography and spectroscopy in astronomical research. His photographic plates of Mars were some of the earliest and most precise images of the planet, and his spectroscopic research helped identify the composition of the Martian atmosphere. Lowell also played a key role in the establishment of the Lowell Observatory's research facilities, including the construction of a 24-inch refracting telescope, the largest in the world at the time. Despite facing skepticism and doubt from some of his peers, Lowell persisted in his efforts to explore the mysteries of the universe and his work remains relevant and influential in astronomical research and popular culture to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(June 5, 1887		New York City-September 17, 1948			New York City)

	
		also known as Ruth Fulton Benedict

	
was
an American
anthropologist.


					</p><p>She was one of the key figures in shaping the field of anthropology in the United States during the 20th century. Benedict is best known for her groundbreaking work in the study of human cultures and societies, particularly her book "Patterns of Culture" which was published in 1934. </p><p>Benedict conducted extensive ethnographic research, studying Native American tribes, as well as cultures in other parts of the world including Japan and Bali. Her work was marked by a deep commitment to cultural relativism, the idea that all cultures should be understood on their own terms rather than judged based on the values of another culture. </p><p>In addition to her academic work, Benedict was also an influential figure in American society. She was a vocal advocate for social justice and racial equality at a time when those causes were not widely championed. Today, she is widely regarded as one of the most important anthropologists of the 20th century and her ideas continue to influence the field of anthropology and beyond.</p><p>Benedict's interest in anthropology began during her undergraduate studies at Vassar College where she was introduced to Franz Boas, a prominent anthropologist and her future mentor. She went on to earn her PhD in anthropology from Columbia University, where she later taught as a professor. Benedict's work on cultural relativism had a profound impact on the discipline of anthropology, challenging the prevailing notion that there was a universal standard of civilization by which all societies could be judged. In addition to "Patterns of Culture," Benedict also wrote several other influential works including "The Chrysanthemum and the Sword" which analyzed the culture of Japan during World War II. Benedict was also a key figure in the development of psychological anthropology, examining the relationship between culture and personality. Despite her numerous contributions to the field of anthropology and beyond, Benedict struggled with her own mental health throughout her life and died of a heart attack at the age of 61.</p><p></p><p>
