(July 28, 1910		Zürich-October 25, 1965			Burghölzli)

	
		also known as Tete

	
was
a Swiss
psychiatrist.


					</p><p>Eduard Einstein was the second son of Albert Einstein, the world-renowned physicist, and his first wife, Mileva Marić. Eduard showed an early aptitude for music and was a talented pianist. He also struggled with mental illness throughout his life and spent time in various psychiatric hospitals. </p><p>In 1930, at the age of 20, Eduard was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was committed to the Burghölzli psychiatric hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. He was treated there for several years before being transferred to a smaller facility closer to his family. </p><p>Despite his struggles, Eduard was close with his father, who visited him regularly and corresponded with him often. Albert Einstein once famously said of his son, "My son Albert is the best thing that happened to me in my life. He is a ray of sunshine that warms me to my core." </p><p>Eduard's condition deteriorated over time, and he remained in and out of hospitals for the rest of his life. He died in 1965 at the age of 55 as a result of a stroke.</p><p>During his time at Burghölzli and other psychiatric facilities, Eduard continued to pursue his passion for music and played piano regularly. He also developed an interest in drawing and produced a number of sketches and paintings throughout his life. Despite his illness, Eduard was known for his wit and sense of humor, and his letters to his family were often filled with clever observations and puns. In addition to his father, Eduard had a close relationship with his younger brother, Hans Albert, who looked after him in his later years. Eduard's story has become a symbol for the struggles that many families face when dealing with mental illness, and his memory continues to inspire research and advocacy in the field of mental health.</p><p>After his death, Eduard Einstein's medical records were unsealed and made public, providing insight into his treatment and the understanding of mental illness during his lifetime. It was suggested that his illness may have been inherited from his mother's side of the family. Today, Eduard's story is often used to promote greater awareness and empathy towards those struggling with mental illness. In 2017, a new species of ant, "Eduardii," was named in honor of Eduard's love for nature and wildlife. Despite the challenges he faced, Eduard Einstein continued to pursue his passions and maintain his humor and creativity throughout his life, leaving a lasting legacy as a talented pianist, artist, and symbol of hope for those struggling with mental illness.</p><p>Eduard Einstein's legacy also influenced his father's scientific pursuits. Albert Einstein wrote in a letter to his friend, Michele Besso, that his son's illness had prompted him to reevaluate the fundamental assumptions of his physics theories. It is said that some of his groundbreaking ideas on consciousness and time were inspired by his son's struggles with mental illness. In addition to his influence on his father's work, Eduard Einstein's life story inspired the book "The Private Life of the Brain: Emotions, Consciousness, and the Secret of the Self" by Susan Greenfield. The book explores the complexity of human emotions and the brain, drawing on Eduard's diagnosis and experiences as a case study.</p><p></p><p>

(November 26, 1857		Geneva-February 22, 1913			Vufflens-le-Château)

	
		also known as Ferdinand Saussure

	
was
a Swiss
personality.


					</p><p>Ferdinand de Saussure was a linguist and semiotician who made significant contributions to the study of language and its structure. He is known as the father of modern linguistics and for his concept of systemic structural linguistics. Saussure was born into a wealthy family and studied law, but his passion for language led him to switch to linguistic studies. He taught at the University of Geneva and published his most famous work, "Course in General Linguistics," in 1916, three years after his death. Saussure's work had a major impact on the field of linguistics, as well as semiotics, philosophy, and the humanities.</p><p>Saussure's concept of systemic structural linguistics helped to shift the emphasis in linguistics from the study of individual words and phrases to the study of language as a system. He believed that language was a social construct and that its meaning is derived from the relationships between signs and symbols rather than from the individual words themselves. Saussure's work paved the way for the development of structuralism, a broad intellectual movement in the 20th century that sought to analyze the underlying structures of various cultural phenomena. </p><p>Saussure himself never published a major work during his lifetime, but his lecture notes were compiled by his students and published posthumously in the form of "Course in General Linguistics." The book went on to become one of the most influential works in the field of linguistics, and Saussure's ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars today. In addition to his contributions to linguistics, Saussure was also a passionate hiker and mountaineer, and spent much of his free time exploring the Swiss Alps.</p><p>Saussure's legacy also includes his distinction between langue and parole, which he introduced in his "Course in General Linguistics" lectures. According to Saussure, langue refers to the system of language, including its structure, rules, and conventions, while parole refers to the actual use of language in communication. This distinction has been influential in the development of linguistic theory and has contributed to our understanding of the complexities of language.</p><p>In addition to his academic contributions, Saussure's personal life was marked by tragedy. His son, Raymond, died at a young age, and his wife, Marie, suffered from mental illness and was institutionalized for much of their marriage. Despite these personal struggles, Saussure remained dedicated to his work and his passion for linguistics.</p><p>Today, Saussure's ideas continue to shape the study of language, semiotics, and cultural analysis, and his influence can be seen in the work of scholars across a variety of disciplines. Though he lived a short life and never published a major work during his lifetime, Saussure's impact on the field of linguistics continues to be felt more than a century after his death.</p><p>Saussure's legacy also includes his work on the nature of language and its relationship to thought. He believed that language not only reflected thought, but also influenced it, and that the structure of language had a profound impact on how people think and perceive the world around them. Saussure's ideas about the relationship between language and thought helped to shape the field of cognitive linguistics, which seeks to understand the ways in which language shapes our understanding of the world.</p><p>Despite his many contributions to the study of language and linguistics, Saussure's ideas were not universally accepted during his lifetime. It was only after his death that his work gained widespread recognition and became a major influence on the field. Today, however, Saussure is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of linguistics, and his ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars around the world.</p><p></p><p>

Cailler was reportedly a dedicated father who instilled a strong work ethic and entrepreneurial spirit in his children. Several of his sons went on to work in the chocolate industry, including his son-in-law, Daniel Peter, who later invented milk chocolate by combining chocolate with condensed milk. </p><p>Throughout his life, Cailler maintained close ties to his home region of Vevey, where he was born and spent much of his life. He was known for his love of nature, and often went on long walks, gathering inspiration for his chocolate creations. In 1840, he built a retirement home for the elderly in Vevey, which still stands today and bears his name. </p><p>Overall, François-Louis Cailler's contributions to Swiss chocolate and philanthropy were significant and have endured over time. Today, the Cailler brand is one of the most reputable and recognized chocolate brands in the world, and it all began with the vision and entrepreneurial spirit of one man.</p><p>Despite his success as a businessman and philanthropist, François-Louis Cailler faced significant challenges throughout his life. He lived through political turmoil in Switzerland, including the Sonderbund War and the Federal Constitution of 1848, which led to significant changes in the country's government and society. Like other entrepreneurs of his time, Cailler had to grapple with the challenges of modernizing his business, including adapting to new technologies and changing consumer tastes. Yet he remained committed to his vision of creating high-quality chocolate that would delight customers while supporting his community. Cailler's life and legacy offer a unique perspective on the history of Switzerland, as well as the roles of business, philanthropy, and family in shaping society.
