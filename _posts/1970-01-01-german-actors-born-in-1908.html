(March 5, 1908		Ludwigsstadt-December 1, 1999			Hamburg)


was
a German
historian and actor.


						</p><p>
							He is best known for his research on the causes of World War I. Fischer's highly contested thesis, known as the "Fischer Controversy," argued that Germany was primarily responsible for starting the war. His work sparked a major re-evaluation of German history and challenged the traditional view that Germany was a victim of the war. Fischer's research also led to the development of the "Sonderweg" thesis, which suggests that Germany had a unique path to modernization that ultimately led to its embrace of aggressive nationalism and imperialism. In addition to his historical work, Fischer was also a prolific actor and appeared in numerous films and television shows in Germany during the 1950s through the 1970s.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=1093884" title="Wikipedia article about Fritz Fischer">Fritz Fischer on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Arno Assmann</h2><p><strong>Arno Assmann</strong>
