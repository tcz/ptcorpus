He established the aviation company, Executive Industries Canada Ltd., which specialized in building helicopters and other aircraft. Under Roman's leadership, the company developed innovative new technologies and products, including the world's first passenger helicopter with a retractable landing gear. He was also instrumental in the development of the Canadian aerospace industry's first turbo-prop aircraft, the Turbo Beaver.
