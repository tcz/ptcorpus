(December 30, 1578		Koldinghus-March 27, 1624			Rühn)


was
a Danish
personality.


					</p><p>Ulrik of Denmark was the younger son of King Frederick II of Denmark and his wife Sophia of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. He was known for his patronage of the arts and literature, and he was a prominent member of the court in Denmark. Ulrik also served as the Governor of the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein from 1617 until his death in 1624. During his years as Governor, he directed various construction projects in these regions, including the construction of a conjoined palace in Tønder. Ulrik's reign was marked by religious tensions between Protestants and Catholics, and he is noted for his persecution of Catholic priests and sympathizers in the region. Despite these controversies, Ulrik was remembered for his contributions to the cultural and artistic life of Denmark, and his patronage of the arts set a standard for later monarchs to follow.</p><p>Ulrik of Denmark was also known as a skilled statesman and diplomat who worked tirelessly to maintain peaceful relations between Denmark and its neighboring countries. He represented Denmark at various courts and was known for his eloquent speeches and diplomatic prowess. Ulrik was also an avid collector of books and manuscripts, and his personal library was considered one of the finest in Europe at the time. He was married to Catherine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, with whom he had two sons, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1615. Ulrik of Denmark died in 1624 in Rühn, Germany, at the age of 45, and was buried in the family chapel in the Roskilde Cathedral in Denmark.</p><p>Ulrik of Denmark's influence on the arts and culture of Denmark was significant, as he encouraged the development of Danish language and literature during a time of great cultural growth in the country. He also sponsored prominent artists and musicians, commissioning works of art and music for his court. Ulrik was known as a lover of music himself, and he played the lute and viola da gamba. He was a member of the Order of the Garter, one of the highest chivalric orders in England, and he maintained close ties with the English court throughout his life. Ulrik's legacy in Denmark is remembered not only for his political and diplomatic achievements but also for his contributions to the country's cultural heritage.</p><p>In addition to his patronage of the arts, Ulrik of Denmark was also a skilled military commander. He fought in several of Denmark's wars, including the Kalmar War, where he played a crucial role as commander of the Danish cavalry. Ulrik was also involved in the Thirty Years' War, leading Danish troops against the Holy Roman Empire. While his military campaigns were not always successful, Ulrik was respected for his bravery and strategic thinking on the battlefield.</p><p>Ulrik of Denmark was also a prolific writer, and he authored several works on political and philosophical topics. His most famous work was "The King's Mirror", a treatise on the qualities that a good king should possess. The book was widely read and influential in its time, and it is still studied by historians and political scientists today.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Ulrik of Denmark's life was not without tragedy. His elder brother, King Christian IV, suffered from mental illness and was often unable to rule effectively. Ulrik was forced to take on more responsibility as a result, but this put him at odds with his brother's advisors and led to tensions within the court. Ulrik also experienced personal losses, including the death of his eldest son, who died at a young age.</p><p>In spite of these challenges, Ulrik of Denmark left a lasting legacy as a patron of the arts, a skilled military commander, and a thoughtful philosopher.

(April 24, 1881		Copenhagen-January 15, 1927			Copenhagen)


was
a Danish
personality.


					</p><p>He was primarily known for his work as a painter and illustrator, but he was also active in the fields of architecture, stage design, and ceramics. Giersing studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and later became a professor there. He was a member of the Modern Breakthrough, a cultural movement that rejected traditional styles and embraced modernism. Giersing's works were often characterized by bold colors and expressive brushstrokes, and he was especially fond of painting landscapes and portraits. Despite his relatively short career, Giersing is considered one of Denmark's most significant modernist painters.</p><p>His paintings are part of several art collections and museums, including the National Gallery of Denmark and the Hirschsprung Collection. Giersing was also known for his collaboration with the Royal Danish Theatre, where he created set designs for various productions. In addition, he designed ceramics for the Royal Copenhagen porcelain factory. Giersing's contribution to the Danish cultural scene was recognized when he was awarded the Thorvaldsen Medal in 1923. Unfortunately, Giersing's life was cut short by his early death at the age of 45 due to a heart condition. Despite his early demise, his influence on Danish modernism continued to be felt long after his passing.</p><p>In addition to his painting and design work, Harald Giersing also wrote extensively on art and aesthetics. He was a contributor to various art magazines and publications and was a prominent voice in the discussions about modern art in Denmark at the time. Giersing was especially interested in the relationship between art and society and believed that art should serve a higher purpose than just decoration. He also experimented with different styles and techniques throughout his career and was not afraid to take risks and challenge conventional norms. Giersing's legacy as a pioneer of Danish modernism continues to inspire artists and cultural critics to this day.</p><p>Giersing is often associated with the Fynboerne group, a group of modernist artists who were active in the early 1900s and were based on the island of Funen in Denmark. The Fynboerne group was known for their interest in everyday life and the use of bright colors and bold brushstrokes in their paintings.</p><p>In addition to his work in the fine arts, Giersing also designed several buildings in Copenhagen, including an apartment building on Vesterbrogade and a villa in the suburb of Virum. His architectural style was influenced by the Art Nouveau movement, which was popular in Europe at the time. </p><p>Giersing's personal life was also notable. He was married to Anna Fischer Giersing, a fellow artist who was also part of the Fynboerne group. The couple had two children and were known for their bohemian lifestyle. They hosted many cultural events at their home in Copenhagen and were friends with other artists and intellectuals of the time.</p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Giersing's impact on Danish art and culture was significant. His modernist approach to painting and design paved the way for future generations of artists, and his ideas about the role of art in society continue to be relevant today.</p><p>Giersing's fascination with color and light was evident not only in his art but also in his interest in photography. He experimented with the medium and even had a darkroom in his home. His photographs often focused on everyday objects and landscapes, and he was particularly fascinated with the play of sunlight on surfaces. In addition to his artistic pursuits, Giersing was also a keen sailor and would often spend time on his boat in the Danish archipelago. He found inspiration in the ever-changing sea and sky, and his love for the natural world is reflected in his paintings.</p><p>Despite his association with the Modern Breakthrough movement, Giersing maintained a deep sense of Danish cultural identity. He was heavily influenced by the works of Hans Christian Andersen and other Danish writers, and his paintings often depicted scenes from Danish folklore or everyday life. His commitment to his roots did not, however, prevent him from engaging with international art movements. He was an admirer of the French Impressionists and the German Expressionists, and he drew inspiration from their use of color and texture.</p><p>Giersing's premature death in 1927 was a significant loss for Danish art and culture. However, his legacy lived on, and his work continued to influence subsequent generations of artists in Denmark and beyond. In recent years, his paintings have been the subject of several retrospectives both in Denmark and internationally, highlighting his enduring significance as a pioneer of Danish modernism.</p><p></p><p>
