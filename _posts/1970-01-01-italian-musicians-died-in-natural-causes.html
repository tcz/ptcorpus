						Monteverdi is considered as one of the most important composers in the transition from Renaissance music to Baroque music. He began his musical career as a choirboy in Cremona and later studied under Marcâ€™Antonio Ingegneri. He served as the court musician in Mantua, where he composed his famous opera, L'Orfeo (1607), which is considered to be one of the earliest operas in the world. Monteverdi's musical style was innovative and he experimented with new forms and harmonies, such as monody, which was a solo song accompanied by a harmonic instrument. He composed hundreds of works including operas, madrigals, motets, and sacred music. In addition to his music career, Monteverdi was a priest and had a deep interest in religious music. His contributions to the music industry are considered to be significant and he remains a prominent figure in music history.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=6226" title="Wikipedia article about Claudio Monteverdi">Claudio Monteverdi on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Fedora Barbieri</h2><p><strong>Fedora Barbieri</strong>
