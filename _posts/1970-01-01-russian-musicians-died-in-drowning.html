						Yanka Dyagileva was a prominent figure in the underground music scene in the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Her music was known for its raw, authentic quality and her lyrics tackled themes such as love, alienation, and disillusionment. Despite her short career, she left a lasting impact on the Russian punk rock and underground music communities. Yanka was also a visual artist and her artworks were often used as cover art for her albums. Tragically, she passed away at the age of 24, reportedly from accidental drowning while under the influence of alcohol, leaving behind a legacy of influential music and inspired artistic expression.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=192922" title="Wikipedia article about Yanka Dyagileva">Yanka Dyagileva on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/indian-musicians-died-at-age-34.html' title='Indian musicians died at age 34'><strong>Indian musicians died at age 34</strong> List of the top 5 Indian music stars who died when they were 34</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-musicians-born-in-1983.html' title='Japanese musicians born in 1983'><strong>Japanese musicians born in 1983</strong> List of the top 41 Japanese  music stars who died in who were born in 1983</a></li><li><a href='/dutch-actresses-died-in-1991.html' title='Dutch actresses died in 1991'><strong>Dutch actresses died in 1991</strong> List of the top 3 Dutch actresses who died in 1991</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/russian-actors-died-in-hepatitis.html' title='Russian actors died in Hepatitis'><strong>Russian actors died in Hepatitis</strong> List of the top 1 Russian actors who died in Hepatitis</a></li><li><a href='/norwegian-musicians-died-at-age-51.html' title='Norwegian musicians died at age 51'><strong>Norwegian musicians died at age 51</strong> List of the top 3 Norwegian music stars who died when they were 51</a></li><li><a href='/cuban-actors-died-in-2007.html' title='Cuban actors died in 2007'><strong>Cuban actors died in 2007</strong> List of the top 3 Cuban actors who died in 2007</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
