(June 12, 1890		Tulln an der Donau-October 31, 1918			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
artist, painter and visual artist.


					</p><p>Schiele was known for his provocative and often controversial subject matter, which included sexually explicit nudes and self-portraits. He was a key figure in the Expressionist movement, and his use of distorted forms and bold, gestural lines influenced many artists who would follow in his footsteps. Schiele's career was cut tragically short by his untimely death at the age of 28, but his work has had a lasting impact on the art world and continues to inspire and influence artists today. Despite his short life, Schiele left behind a significant body of work, including hundreds of drawings and paintings that are admired for their raw energy and intense emotional power.</p><p>Schiele's artistic career began at a young age, as he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna at just 16 years old. However, he soon became dissatisfied with the traditionally conservative teachings at the Academy and began to explore more experimental styles and subject matter on his own.</p><p>In 1909, Schiele met fellow artist Gustav Klimt, who became a mentor and important influence on his work. Klimt introduced Schiele to the world of Vienna's avant-garde artists and helped him gain recognition in the art world.</p><p>Despite controversy surrounding his explicit content, Schiele gained a following of admirers and collectors, including the influential art dealer Arthur Roessler, who helped to promote his work.</p><p>Schiele's personal life was also marked by scandal. He entered into a tumultuous relationship with a young woman named Wally Neuzil, whom he often painted and who became a frequent subject of his work. Schiele was also arrested and briefly imprisoned for his depictions of nude minors, which were considered pornographic by Austrian authorities.</p><p>Throughout his brief but prolific career, Schiele pushed artistic boundaries and created a body of work that remains influential and relevant today. His legacy continues to inspire artists and art lovers around the world.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his life and work, Egon Schiele's art has been exhibited in major museums and galleries around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Leopold Museum in Vienna. In recent years, his artwork has sold for record-breaking prices at auctions, cementing his place as one of the most important artists of the 20th century. Schiele's influence can be seen in the work of many contemporary artists, who continue to experiment with provocative subject matter and unconventional techniques. His tragic death at a young age has only added to his mystique and the enduring appeal of his art.</p><p></p><p>

(February 3, 1887		Salzburg-November 3, 1914			Kraków)

	
		also known as Trakl, Georg

	
was
an Austrian
writer, pharmacist and poet.


					</p><p>Trakl is considered one of the most important poets of Expressionism in German literature. His poetry often explored themes of death, decay, and existential anxiety, which may have influenced his struggles with addiction and mental health. Despite only living to the age of 27, Trakl left behind a significant body of work, including two poetry collections, "Gedichte" and "Sebastian im Traum," as well as several prose pieces. His poetic style, characterized by its musicality and vivid imagery, continues to inspire and captivate readers to this day.</p><p>Trakl's childhood was marked by familial instability due to his parents' troubled marriage and his father's alcoholism. As a result, he and his siblings spent much of their time with their grandparents, who instilled in Trakl a love for literature and music. Trakl went on to study pharmacy in Vienna and worked as a pharmacist throughout his adult life. His job as a pharmacist, however, often served as a source of financial stability but also contributed to his addiction to morphine. </p><p>During World War I, Trakl served as a medic on the Eastern front, an experience that deeply affected him and his writing. His poetry reflected the horrors of war and the tragedy of human suffering. Despite his brief career, Trakl's influence on German Expressionism and subsequent generations of poets has been immense. His work has been translated into numerous languages and continues to be appreciated for its haunting beauty and deep emotional resonance.</p><p>Trakl's poetry was not immediately recognized during his lifetime, and it was not until the 1920s that his work gained widespread critical acclaim. Today, he is considered one of the most significant poets of the early 20th century, with his work having a profound impact on German poetry and on European literature as a whole. Trakl's influence can be seen in the works of a number of other poets, including Paul Celan and Rainer Maria Rilke. Trakl's life and tragic death have also been the subject of numerous works of literature and film, attesting to the enduring interest in his life and work.</p><p></p><p>

(April 3, 1880		Vienna-October 4, 1903			Vienna)


was
an Austrian
writer and philosopher.


					</p><p>Despite his short life, Weininger is best known for his controversial and influential work "Sex and Character," which explores the ideas of gender and sexuality. The work argues that all humans possess both masculine and feminine traits, and claims that the perceived distinctions between genders are artificial constructs perpetuated by society. Weininger's work was met with both acclaim and criticism, and his ideas continue to be debated by scholars to this day. He was also known for his radical views on Judaism and anti-Semitism, which sparked controversy during his lifetime and contributed to his tragic end.</p><p>Weininger's family was Jewish and he converted to Protestantism at the age of 23. His views on Judaism were complex and controversial. In "Sex and Character," Weininger argued that Jews were a "feminine" race and that their perceived feminine qualities were responsible for anti-Semitic prejudice. He saw Judaism as a religion that encouraged a "feminine" way of thinking and viewed Christianity as a religion that emphasized masculine virtues. These views have been widely criticized as misguided and offensive.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his work, Weininger's ideas had a significant impact on 20th-century thought. His ideas on gender and sexuality were influential for early feminists and helped challenge traditional notions of gender roles. Sigmund Freud was also influenced by Weininger's work, particularly his ideas on the duality of human nature. However, many of Weininger's ideas are now criticized for being essentialist and oversimplified.</p><p>In addition to his philosophical and literary work, Otto Weininger was also known for his academic achievements. He studied mathematics and philosophy at the University of Vienna, where he received his PhD at the young age of 21. Despite his intellectual prowess, Weininger struggled with mental health issues and was hospitalized for depression several times throughout his life. </p><p>Weininger's tragic end came at just 23 years old when he died by suicide in his family's apartment in Vienna. The exact reasons for his suicide are unclear, but it is widely believed that his struggles with mental illness, personal and professional disappointments, and societal rejection of his controversial ideas all contributed to his decision. Despite his short life, Otto Weininger's work continues to influence philosophical and cultural movements to this day.</p><p></p><p>

personality.


					</p><p>He was a medical student who was known for his anti-Semitic views and beliefs. During World War I, Braunsteiner joined the Austrian Army and served on the Eastern Front. He was later taken prisoner by the Russian Army and sent to a POW camp in Tashkent, where he died of typhus at the age of 24. Despite his short life, Braunsteiner's legacy continues, as he is often referred to as a precursor to the Nazi ideology that emerged in Austria and Germany in the 1930s. Some historians have also noted his influence on the development of the "Sturmabteilung" or "SA," the Nazi Party's paramilitary organization.</p><p>Additionally, Karl Braunsteiner's personal writings were later discovered and published, providing insight into his extremist views and serving as a source for researchers studying the roots of anti-Semitism in Austria. In recent years, the legacy of Braunsteiner and his connections to Nazi ideology have been the subject of debate and controversy in Austria, particularly in regards to his role in shaping the political landscape of the country in the early 20th century. Overall, Karl Braunsteiner is remembered as a controversial figure in Austrian history whose radical beliefs left a lasting impact on the world.</p><p>Braunsteiner's anti-Semitic views could be traced back to his childhood and adolescence, during which time he was exposed to the writings of anti-Semitic authors, such as Georg von Schönerer and Karl Lueger. His university education, which began in 1911, further fueled his beliefs, as he joined the Pan-Germanic movement, a nationalist and anti-Semitic faction. Braunsteiner's extremist views and his involvement in far-right organizations ultimately led to his arrest in 1914 by the Austrian authorities. He was later released, and he joined the army to fight in World War I.</p><p>After Braunsteiner's death, his writings were seized by the Russian authorities, and some were later published. They outlined his belief in the superiority of the "Aryan" race and his admiration for Adolf Hitler. Many historians consider Braunsteiner to be an important precursor to Nazi ideology in Austria and a key figure in the development of the far-right movement in the country.</p><p>Today, there are ongoing debates about how best to remember Braunsteiner and his legacy in Austria. Some argue that he should be forgotten and that the focus should be on the millions of victims of the Holocaust, which was ultimately perpetrated by the Nazi Party. Others believe that it is important to study figures like Braunsteiner to better understand the roots of anti-Semitism and extremism in Austria and to prevent such views from gaining traction in the future.</p><p></p><p>

(April 14, 1920		Innsbruck-May 2, 1945)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>She is best known for being the personal cook and food taster for Adolf Hitler. Manziarly joined Hitler's staff in 1943, working at the Wolf's Lair headquarters in East Prussia. Her job was to ensure that Hitler's food was not poisoned, as he feared assassination attempts. </p><p>In addition to her role as a food taster, Manziarly also served as Hitler's personal chef, preparing his favorite meals and striving to constantly impress him. She was known for her culinary skills and attention to detail, which helped her earn Hitler's trust and favor. </p><p>Tragically, Manziarly died at the young age of 25. In the final days of the war, she was one of several people who remained with Hitler in the Führerbunker in Berlin. She was reportedly one of the last people to see Hitler alive before he committed suicide on April 30, 1945. Manziarly's own cause of death is unclear, but it is believed that she may have taken her own life alongside other members of Hitler's entourage in the bunker. </p><p>Despite her proximity to one of history's most notorious figures, Manziarly remains a somewhat mysterious and enigmatic figure. Many details of her life are still unknown, and her legacy continues to be debated and discussed by historians and the public.</p><p>According to some reports, Constanze Manziarly was in a romantic relationship with one of Hitler's aides, Rochus Misch, who was also present in the Führerbunker during the final days of the war. Manziarly's family members stated after the war that she may have taken her own life due to despair and hopelessness, as she had witnessed the devastating events of the war and the downfall of the Nazi regime. Her body was never officially identified, and her remains were likely disposed of alongside the other casualties of the bunker.

However, if the diary exists, its whereabouts are unknown.</p><p>Despite her association with Hitler, Manziarly's family has stated that they do not believe she shared his extremist views. Her great-niece, Elisabeth Frink, has described her as a "victim of circumstances" who was simply trying to survive in a difficult time. In recent years, there has been some debate over whether those who served Hitler in a support role, such as Manziarly, should be viewed as culpable for the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime.</p><p>In any case, the story of Constanze Manziarly continues to intrigue and fascinate, serving as a reminder of the complex and often tragic circumstances surrounding one of history's darkest chapters.</p><p></p><p>
