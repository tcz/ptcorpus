was
a French
writer, philosopher and novelist.


					</p><p>She was born in Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris, France, and studied philosophy at the Sorbonne, where she was one of the first women to earn a degree in the subject. After completing her studies, she began writing and published several novels and essays on various topics, including spirituality, sexuality, and feminism.</p><p>Throughout her life, Choisy was known for her controversial views and her willingness to challenge traditional social norms. She was particularly interested in exploring the relationship between religion and sexuality, and her work in this area attracted both praise and criticism.</p><p>Choisy also traveled extensively throughout her life and wrote extensively about her experiences in places like India, China, and Japan. Her work often reflected her belief in the spiritual and mystical elements of Eastern religions, and she drew on these beliefs to develop her own unique philosophy of life.</p><p>In addition to her writing, Choisy was also a prominent activist and advocate for women's rights. She was involved in various feminist causes throughout her life, and her work helped to pave the way for future generations of women to achieve greater equality and recognition in the world of philosophy and literature.</p><p>Despite facing criticism from many traditionalists, Choisy continued to write and publish on a wide variety of social, cultural, and sexual topics. She helped to break down taboos around female sexuality and challenged the notion that women should be subservient to men. She was also a vocal critic of colonialism and imperialism, and her writing often explored the ways in which these systems of power affected people's lives and relationships.</p><p>In addition to her writing and activism, Choisy also worked as a translator, translating works from both Eastern and Western traditions. She was known for her deep understanding of many different cultural traditions and her ability to bridge divides between them.</p><p>Today, Choisy is remembered as an important figure in French feminist and philosophical circles, and her work continues to inspire new generations of writers, activists, and thinkers.</p><p>One of Choisy's notable works is her book "Les Conversions" ("The Conversions"), which was published in 1928. In the book, she explores the concept of conversion, looking at how people change their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors throughout their lives. She draws on her own experiences and those of others, examining the role of religion, sexuality, and identity in the process of personal transformation. The book was praised for its depth and insightful analysis, and it remains a classic in the field of psychology and philosophy.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of Choisy's life is her close relationship with the famous writer and artist, Colette. The two women met in the 1920s and became close friends and confidants. Choisy helped Colette with translations of her work into other languages, and the two often traveled together. Their correspondence has been published and gives insight into the intellectual and personal lives of two of France's most influential female writers of the time.</p><p>Despite her many accomplishments, Choisy's legacy has been somewhat overshadowed by some of her more controversial beliefs and actions. She believed in the use of drugs and hypnosis as aids to achieving spiritual and sexual enlightenment, which was considered highly unconventional at the time. She also had relationships with both men and women, openly discussing her bisexuality in her writing. While these beliefs and actions were seen as scandalous by many, they were also a reflection of Choisy's commitment to breaking down barriers and redefining societal norms in her own way.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Jean-Baptiste du Val-de-Grace, baron de Cloots

	
was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>Anacharsis Cloots was a significant figure during the French Revolution, known as "orator of the human race." He was a fervent supporter of the French Revolution and an active member of the Jacobin Club. Cloots was born in Kleve (now part of Germany) to a wealthy Prussian family and educated in theology, law, and philosophy in Paris. He was also fluent in several languages, including French, German, Dutch, English, and Italian.</p><p>Cloots was a firm believer in universal equality and the idea of a world without borders, which led him to join the revolutionaries and adopt the name "Anacharsis," after an ancient Greek philosopher who renounced his citizenship to become a citizen of the world. He actively campaigned for the abolition of monarchy and aristocracy, advocating for a global republic. In 1792, he became a member of the National Convention and even proposed a resolution to declare French the universal language.</p><p>However, despite his convictions, Cloots fell victim to the Reign of Terror, and in March 1794, he was arrested and accused of being a foreign spy. He was tried and found guilty and sentenced to death. On March 24, 1794, he was guillotined in Paris, becoming one of the many victims of the Terror. Despite his tragic end, his legacy as a visionary philosopher and advocate for human rights continues to live on.</p><p>Anacharsis Cloots was also known for his extravagant lifestyle and eccentricities. He dressed in flamboyant outfits, often riding through the streets of Paris on horseback while wearing Greek robes and carrying a scepter. He also threw lavish parties that were attended by many of the era's intellectual elite. In addition to his political writings, he published several works on religion, including "The Universal Religion," in which he argued for a new religion based on reason and science rather than dogma and tradition. His ideas on religion and the role of the state in promoting equality were highly influential in the years following his death, as Europe continued to grapple with the legacy of the French Revolution. Today, Anacharsis Cloots is recognised as one of the most important political thinkers of his time, and his ideas continue to inspire scholars and activists around the world.</p><p>Apart from his political and philosophical activities, Anacharsis Cloots was also involved in literary and theatrical circles in Paris during the 18th century. He was a member of the "Society of Thirty," which included many famous writers and thinkers such as Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Voltaire. Cloots also wrote plays, including "La Toile d'araignée" (The Spider's Web), which was performed at the Comédie-Française in 1791.</p><p>Cloots was a supporter of the idea of a federation of Europe, which would unite all the nations of the continent under a single government. He believed that this would promote peace, prosperity, and the free exchange of ideas and culture. Cloots also championed the cause of women's rights, advocating for equal opportunities and social justice for women.</p><p>Despite his talents and ideals, Anacharsis Cloots was ultimately unable to escape the violence and chaos of the French Revolution. His legacy, however, continues to inspire those who seek to build a more just and equitable world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by capital punishment.

(June 19, 1623		Clermont-Ferrand-August 19, 1662			Paris)


was
a French
physicist, writer, philosopher, mathematician and inventor.


					</p><p>Some of Pascal's most significant contributions include his work on probability theory and the development of the hydraulic press. He is also known for his religious writings, including the Pensées, which explore the nature of faith and the existence of God. Pascal was a prodigy from a young age, and his early work on projective geometry earned him recognition in the mathematical community. He later worked as a tax collector for his father, but continued to pursue his scientific and philosophical interests in his spare time. Despite struggling with health issues throughout his life, Pascal made valuable contributions to a wide range of fields and left a lasting impact on the world of science and philosophy.</p><p>In addition to his work in mathematics and physics, Pascal is famous for creating the first calculating machine, which originated from his father's work as a tax collector. Known as the Pascaline, the machine used a series of gears and wheels to make calculations faster and more accurate. Pascal's contributions to the understanding of atmospheric pressure and the principles of barometry also played a significant role in the development of the steam engine and the study of fluid dynamics. Apart from his work in science, Pascal was also known for his philosophical ideas, which influenced later thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Friedrich Nietzsche. Despite his relatively short life, Pascal left an indelible impression on the intellectual world and his work continues to be studied and admired today.</p><p>Pascal's religious beliefs also played a significant role in his life and work. In the mid-1650s, he had a religious experience that led him to become devoutly Christian. He subsequently abandoned his scientific work for a time and focused on theology, writing several influential works on the subject. Pascal's most famous religious work is the Pensées, a collection of notes on philosophy and religion that were published posthumously. The Pensées are known for their exploration of the "wager" argument for the existence of God, which posits that it makes more sense to believe in God (even without certainty) than to not believe, since the potential benefits of belief (eternal salvation) outweigh the potential risks of disbelief (eternal damnation).</p><p>Despite his contributions to both science and religion, Pascal's health issues continued to plague him throughout his life. He suffered from chronic headaches and stomach problems, and died at the age of 39. Nevertheless, Pascal's work continues to be celebrated and studied today, and he is remembered as one of the most brilliant minds of his time.</p><p></p><p>

(December 2, 1859		Paris-March 29, 1891			Paris)

	
		a.k.a. Georges Seurat or Georges-Pierre Seurat

	
was
a French
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering work in the field of Neo-Impressionism, which sought to guide art towards a more scientific, objective approach. Seurat is renowned for his meticulous technique of pointillism, in which he created images consisting of tiny, individual dots of color that combine to form coherent visual works. Seurat's most famous painting, "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte," is a testament to his mastery of pointillism and his ability to capture the essence of modern life. In addition to painting, Seurat was also a talented draftsman and printmaker, and he created a number of works in these mediums during his short career. Despite his early death at the age of 31, Seurat left a lasting legacy on the world of art, inspiring subsequent generations of artists and influencing the development of modern art in the 20th century.</p><p>Born into a well-to-do family, Seurat displayed a love for art from a young age. He attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he studied under renowned painter Henri Lehmann. However, Seurat was dissatisfied with the traditional techniques of his instructors and began developing his own style, incorporating elements of Impressionism and Pointillism.</p><p>In 1884, Seurat founded the Société des Artistes Indépendants, a group dedicated to exhibiting the work of emerging artists who were rejected by the official Paris Salon. It was through this organization that Seurat's work gained critical attention, culminating in a solo exhibition in 1888.</p><p>Seurat's work was revolutionary for his time, as he sought to break from tradition and create a new visual language. He applied scientific principles to his art, studying color theory and the psychological effects of color on the human eye. His paintings often depicted everyday life in Paris, with a focus on the working-class and leisure activities. </p><p>Tragically, Seurat died at the young age of 31 from a rare form of meningitis. However, his influence lived on through subsequent generations of artists who were inspired by his techniques and his contributions to the development of modern art.</p><p>One of Seurat's early notable works was the painting "Bathers at Asnières" which was exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 1884. Despite its rejection from the official Paris Salon, the painting received critical acclaim and remains one of Seurat's most recognized works. He continued to produce innovative pieces, such as "The Circus," which displayed his interest in color theory by juxtaposing complementary colors in a single painting.</p><p>Seurat also created a number of technical pieces, including his Conté crayon drawings and lithographs. His fascination with color and light led him to develop a system of color theory that attributed emotional and psychological significance to different hues. This approach influenced other artists, such as Vincent van Gogh and Paul Signac.</p><p>Seurat's legacy continued to affect art movements throughout the 20th century, particularly in the field of abstract art. His use of pointillism and focus on the scientific principles of color theory were influential in the development of Neo-Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and even the Pointillist movement in America. Today, his works can be found in major museums and collections around the world, and his contributions to the evolution of modern art continue to be studied and admired.</p><p></p><p>

was
a French
artist, painter and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is famous for his innovative and distinctive works in the field of Post-Impressionism and is widely regarded as one of the foremost artists of his time. Henri suffered from genetic health conditions due to inbreeding in his family, which left him with fragile health and small stature. Despite this, he had a remarkable artistic career, with a large body of works featuring colorful and often provocative subject matter, including the Parisian nightlife, cabarets, brothels, and the circus. His unique style of art continues to inspire and influence artists to this day. In addition to his widely acclaimed artwork, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was also known for his eccentric personality and love of the bohemian lifestyle.</p><p>He belonged to a wealthy and aristocratic family and was raised by his mother and grandmother after his father's death. Henri showed an early interest in art and enrolled in the School of Fine Arts in Paris when he was just 18 years old. However, he was forced to leave due to health issues and later became a student of the famous painter Leon Bonnat. Henri had a close relationship with his father's cousin, Gabriel Tapié de Celigny, who became his mentor and introduced him to the Parisian art scene. Henri's works became more popular after he participated in several exhibitions, and he gained recognition for his use of color, exceptional draftsmanship, and unique representation of the Parisian lifestyle. Despite his success, Henri's health continued to deteriorate, and he died at the young age of 36 due to complications from alcoholism and syphilis.

		also known as Rene Daumal

	
was
a French
writer, novelist and poet.


					</p><p>Daumal was associated with the Surrealist movement and was particularly influenced by the teachings of Gurdjieff. He founded a literary magazine called Le Grand Jeu (The Great Game) along with his friends Roger Gilbert-Lecomte and Roger Vailland, which published works that were often experimental and surreal. Daumal's most famous work is the novel "Mount Analogue," which is a philosophical allegory about a group of adventurers who embark on a journey to find an imaginary mountain that is said to exist beyond the boundaries of time and space. His work has been described as mystical and metaphysical, and continues to be popular among readers interested in avant-garde literature.</p><p>Daumal was born into a middle-class family and spent his childhood in a small village in France. He developed an early interest in literature and was an avid reader from a young age. At the age of 18, he moved to Paris to pursue his studies in philosophy and literature. It was during this time that he became involved with the Surrealist movement and met his future collaborators, Gilbert-Lecomte and Vailland.</p><p>Daumal's fascination with Gurdjieff's teachings led him to become a member of the Gurdjieff group in Paris. This had a profound influence on his writing and his philosophy, which emphasized the importance of self-awareness and the search for inner meaning. His novel "Mount Analogue" can be seen as a reflection of these ideas, as it explores the themes of spiritual enlightenment and the quest for transcendence.</p><p>Throughout his short life, Daumal struggled with health problems, including tuberculosis, which eventually led to his untimely death at the age of 36. Despite his relatively brief career, his work has had a lasting impact on the world of literature, and he is remembered as one of the most talented and innovative writers of his time.</p><p>Daumal's literary contribution also included translations of several works, including a translation of P.D. Ouspensky's "A New Model of the Universe" into French. In addition to his writings, Daumal was also a talented artist and musician, playing the piano and guitar. He was known for his eccentricity and his unconventional lifestyle, often living in poverty and spending his days writing and exploring spiritual practices. </p><p>Despite his struggles with health and financial instability, Daumal continued to produce influential works throughout his life, with "Mount Analogue" being considered a landmark of 20th-century literature.

		also known as Red virgin or The Martian

	
was
a French
philosopher, teacher, political activist and writer.


					</p><p>Simone Weil was born to a Jewish family in Paris and was known for her strong social and political beliefs. She was a teacher of philosophy at various institutions and was actively involved in political activism, particularly in the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II. Weil's writings focus on topics such as suffering, poverty and the human condition, and her most notable works include "Gravity and Grace" and "The Need for Roots." She also had a strong interest in religious and spiritual issues and explored Christianity, as well as other religious traditions, throughout her life. Despite her many accomplishments, Weil struggled with mental health issues and died at the young age of 34 while living in exile in England. Today, she is widely regarded as a leading philosopher of the 20th century and her work continues to influence scholars and activists around the world.</p><p>Weil's political activism began during her time at the École Normale Supérieure, where she became involved in left-wing politics and joined the French Communist Party. However, she soon became disillusioned with the party and left to join the Trotskyist movement. Weil's experiences in the Spanish Civil War only strengthened her convictions and she later joined the French Resistance during World War II, working as a factory laborer and eventually serving as a member of the Free French Air Force.</p><p>Weil's writings were diverse and covered a range of topics. In addition to her philosophical works, she also wrote articles and essays on political and social issues. One notable example was her essay "The Iliad, or the Poem of Force," which explored the relationship between power and violence. Weil was also a prolific letter-writer and her correspondence with various intellectuals, including Albert Camus, has been published.</p><p>Despite her Jewish background, Weil was drawn to Christianity and even considered becoming a Christian mystic. She believed that Christianity offered a unique perspective on suffering and the human condition, and her exploration of Christian theology and mysticism greatly influenced her later writings.</p><p>Today, Weil's work continues to be studied and celebrated by scholars and activists alike. Her ideas on empathy and compassion, as well as her critiques of power and violence, continue to resonate with people around the world.</p><p>Throughout her life, Simone Weil was known for her staunch refusal to compromise on her principles. She lived an ascetic lifestyle, often going without food or sleep so that she could better understand the struggles of the poor and marginalized. She saw her own suffering as a way of connecting with others who were similarly marginalized or oppressed. This deep empathy and compassion for others is a central theme of her work.</p><p>Weil's influence on 20th century philosophy cannot be overstated. Albert Camus, who corresponded with Weil for a time, once said that she "might well be the patron saint of all outsiders." Weil's ideas on the interconnectedness of all living beings and her belief in the importance of empathy and compassion continue to inspire people today. Her work on the relationship between power and violence has been especially influential, with many activists and scholars drawing on her insights to better understand the dynamics of oppression and resistance in modern society.</p><p></p><p>

He reached out to revolutionaries in Britain and the United States, and advocated for a united front against the forces of reaction and tyranny.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Brissot's legacy has been tarnished by his association with the Girondist faction and his role in the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. His political opponents accused him of being a warmonger and a traitor, and his support for the war effort ultimately led to his downfall.</p><p>Today, Jacques Pierre Brissot is remembered as a passionate advocate for social and political reform, a fierce opponent of slavery, and a courageous defender of human rights.

The two men spent endless hours discussing their ideas and debating the most pressing issues of their day. When La Boétie became ill, Montaigne traveled to Bordeaux to be by his side and care for him during his final days. After La Boétie's death, Montaigne honored his friend's memory by including a long essay on him in his "Essays," in which he praised La Boétie's intellect, wit, and bravery.</p><p>Today, La Boétie's ideas remain as relevant as ever, and his writings continue to inspire political thinkers, activists, and scholars around the world. His belief in the power of individuals to resist tyranny and oppression and his call for people to exercise their freedom and assert their rights as citizens continue to resonate with people of all backgrounds and cultures.</p><p></p><p>

(June 12, 1754		Rennes-April 22, 1794			Paris)

	
		a.k.a. Isaac Rene Guy le Chapelier

	
was
a French
lawyer and politician.


					</p><p>Isaac René Guy le Chapelier was a key figure in the French Revolution, known for his advocacy of the separation of powers and his role in drafting the Le Chapelier Law of 1791, which prohibited workers' associations and strikes. He was a member of the National Constituent Assembly and served as the President of the Assembly from 16 to 30 September 1791. Despite his early support for the Revolution, he became increasingly critical of extremist factions and was arrested in 1793. He was found guilty of "moderatism" and "federalist leanings" and was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal. He was executed by guillotine on April 22, 1794. His legacy is contentious, with some viewing him as a champion of individual freedom and others as a defender of the privileged classes.</p><p>Isaac René Guy le Chapelier was born into a wealthy family and received an excellent education, graduating with a degree in law. He established himself as a successful lawyer, winning many high-profile cases. He entered politics in 1789, after being elected as a deputy to the Estates-General. He was a member of the Jacobin Club and worked closely with Maximilien Robespierre, who he had befriended during their time together in the National Constituent Assembly. </p><p>Le Chapelier was a passionate advocate for democracy and played a key role in the drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. He passionately believed in the separation of powers and sought to limit the authority of the king. However, he was also strongly opposed to working-class organizations like trade unions, which he saw as a threat to individual liberty. He helped draft the Le Chapelier Law of 1791, which banned such organizations, a move that was widely criticized by left-wing radicals.</p><p>Despite his early support for the Revolution, Le Chapelier became increasingly disillusioned with the direction it was taking. He grew critical of the radicalism of the Mountain faction and was arrested in 1793. Tried and found guilty of "moderatism" and "federalist leanings," he was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal.</p><p>Le Chapelier's legacy continues to be the subject of intense debate. Supporters see him as a defender of individual freedom, while critics argue that his opposition to working-class organizations shows that he was more concerned with protecting the interests of the bourgeoisie. Nevertheless, his contribution to the French Revolution is undeniable, and his beliefs continue to influence political debate to this day.</p><p>Le Chapelier's early life was marked by tragedies, as he lost his father at a young age and his mother when he was only 18. Despite this, he persevered and went on to become a well-respected lawyer and politician. His strong beliefs in individual liberty and democracy earned him widespread acclaim, and his role in drafting the Le Chapelier Law cemented his place in history.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Le Chapelier was also an accomplished writer and published several works on law and politics. He was a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques and was widely respected for his intellectual prowess.</p><p>Although his life was tragically cut short, Le Chapelier has left a lasting mark on French history and politics. His legacy reminds us of the importance of protecting individual freedoms while also considering the needs of the greater community.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by guillotine.

		otherwise known as Theodore Gericault or Géricault, Théodore

	
was
a French
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the pioneers of the Romantic movement in French art and is best known for his series of paintings called "The Raft of the Medusa." Géricault was also known for his portraits and equestrian paintings. Despite dying at a young age of 32, his work had a significant influence on later artists and movements, including the Impressionists. Géricault was also a trained anatomist and often studied anatomy as part of his artistic education, resulting in a heightened realism in his work.</p><p>Géricault was born into an affluent family, his father being a lawyer and his mother a daughter of a wealthy shipowner. Growing up, Géricault developed a passion for horses which he later integrated into his art, often painting them with great detail and accuracy. He studied under the neoclassical painter Carle Vernet and later under Pierre-Narcisse Guérin, where he learned the techniques of oil painting and classical art. Despite his success as an artist, Géricault suffered from mental health issues and often struggled with depression which was reflected in his work. He also had a turbulent personal life and had affairs with married women. Géricault's pioneering approach to art and his tragic life has made him a figure of fascination for art historians, with his works continuing to inspire and captivate audiences to this day.</p><p>Géricault's most famous work, "The Raft of the Medusa," was inspired by a real-life event in which a French ship ran aground off the coast of Africa in 1816, resulting in the deaths of most of the passengers and crew. The painting depicts the survivors of the shipwreck huddled together on a makeshift raft, with some resorting to cannibalism in order to survive. Géricault's powerful portrayal of the human suffering and resilience in the face of adversity made the painting an instant sensation and a symbol of political and social commentary.  </p><p>In addition to his art, Géricault was also interested in other areas such as archaeology and horse racing. He commissioned a life-size plaster model of the famous Borghese Gladiator statue, which he used as a reference for his paintings. He also owned several racehorses, which he trained himself and raced in local competitions.</p><p>Géricault's legacy can be seen in the works of many artists who followed him, including Eugène Delacroix, Edouard Manet, and Vincent van Gogh. His influence can also be seen in other fields such as literature and music, with authors such as Victor Hugo and Charles Baudelaire citing his work as inspiration. Today, Géricault's paintings are held in museums and private collections worldwide and continue to be celebrated for their emotional intensity and technical skill.</p><p></p><p>

lawyer and politician.


					</p><p>Georges Couthon was an influential figure during the French Revolution and was known for his extreme radicalism. He was a member of the Committee of Public Safety, a powerful government body that oversaw France's domestic and foreign policies during the Revolution's most tumultuous years.</p><p>Couthon was a key figure in the Reign of Terror, a period of intense violence and state-sanctioned executions aimed at rooting out counter-revolutionary elements in France. He played a leading role in the purges of the Girondins, a group of moderate republicans who opposed the radicalization of the Revolution.</p><p>Despite his reputation as a ruthless ideologue, Couthon was also known for his advocacy on behalf of the poor and his efforts to improve the conditions of the working classes. He was a strong supporter of universal suffrage and believed in the redistribution of wealth as a means of promoting social justice.</p><p>Couthon's political career came to an abrupt end when he was arrested and sentenced to death during the fall of Robespierre, another key figure in the Reign of Terror. He died on the guillotine in 1794, along with many of his fellow revolutionaries.</p><p>As a child, Couthon suffered from a bone disease that left him permanently disabled and confined to a wheelchair. Despite his physical limitations, he pursued a successful career as a lawyer, becoming known for his impassioned defense of the underprivileged. He was elected to the National Convention in 1792, and quickly emerged as a key ally of Maximilien Robespierre. </p><p>Couthon played a significant role in the passing of several important laws during the Revolution, including the Law of Suspects that allowed for the imprisonment and execution of anyone deemed an enemy of the Revolution. He was also a driving force behind the establishment of a state religion, the Cult of the Supreme Being, that was intended to promote civic morality and virtue.</p><p>Despite his extreme views and actions, Couthon was seen by some as a benevolent figure who genuinely cared about the plight of the poor. He was also known for his close friendship with Robespierre, who considered him one of his most trusted confidants. </p><p>Couthon's legacy is one of both radicalism and compassion, and his role in shaping the course of the French Revolution continues to be studied and debated by historians today.</p><p>Couthon's involvement in the Reign of Terror was marked by his unwavering dedication to the revolutionary cause. He was responsible for implementing many of the policies that led to the arrest and execution of thousands of people deemed to be enemies of the state. His reputation for ruthlessness was such that he was nicknamed the "Angel of Death" by his enemies.However, Couthon's desire to improve the lives of the less fortunate was also evident in his political actions. He was a strong advocate for the abolition of slavery and for the rights of women. He was also instrumental in the establishment of the first system of public education in France, which he saw as a means of providing equal opportunities for all citizens.Couthon's physical disability never deterred him from his political ambitions, and he continued to work tirelessly on behalf of the Revolution until his arrest and execution. His life and career stand as a testament to the complexities of the French Revolution and the varied motivations and ideologies of those who participated in it.</p><p></p><p>

was
a French
novelist.


					</p><p>Along with his brother, Edmond de Goncourt, Jules de Goncourt co-wrote several novels under the pen name "Goncourt". The brothers are known for pioneering the naturalist style of writing in France and for establishing the Goncourt Academy, a literary society that awards an annual prize for French literature. Jules also had a passion for collecting and wrote extensively on art and furniture. He and his brother amassed a large collection of 18th-century French furniture, which was bequeathed to the French government and can now be seen in the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. Jules de Goncourt died at the age of 39 from complications related to syphilis.</p><p>Before writing fiction, Jules de Goncourt pursued a career as an art critic and journalist. He authored several books on art and aesthetics, including "L'Art du XVIIIe siècle" (The Art of the 18th Century) and "Gavarni, l'homme et l'oeuvre" (Gavarni, the Man and His Work). In addition to his literary and artistic pursuits, he also had a keen interest in politics, and was an active supporter of Republican and socialist causes. After his death, Edmond de Goncourt established the Prix Goncourt in his brother's honor, which has since become one of the most prestigious literary awards in France. The brothers also wrote a series of journals, collectively known as "Journal des Goncourt," which offer a detailed and candid look at French society and culture in the 19th century.</p><p>Jules de Goncourt was born in Paris to a family of wealthy textile merchants. Unlike his brother Edmond, Jules did not receive a formal education and instead was tutored at home by his mother. However, his lack of formal schooling did not hinder his literary and artistic pursuits, and he was a voracious reader and art aficionado from a young age.</p><p>In 1851, the brothers published their first novel, "En 18__," which was a thinly veiled satire of Parisian society. The novel garnered both critical acclaim and controversy, with some critics taking issue with the book's explicit language and depiction of immoral behavior.</p><p>Despite these early controversies, the brothers continued to write prolifically and gained a reputation as two of France's foremost literary figures. In addition to their novels, they also wrote several plays and contributed to a number of literary and artistic journals.</p><p>Jules' interests in art and furniture collecting also led him to become an advocate for preserving French art and culture. In addition to his own collection, he championed the preservation of historic buildings and monuments, and worked closely with the French government to establish laws protecting these treasures.</p><p>Today, Jules de Goncourt is remembered as one of the pioneers of naturalist literature and a key figure in the development of French art and aesthetics. His legacy continues through the Prix Goncourt, the Goncourt Academy, and the preservation of his and his brother's vast collection of art and furniture.</p><p></p><p>

physician.


					</p><p>During his relatively short life, Duchesne made several important contributions to the field of medicine. He is best known for his discovery of the antibiotic properties of a particular strain of mold, which he called "penicillium glaucum". This discovery predated Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin by over 30 years, but unfortunately, Duchesne's work was largely overlooked at the time.</p><p>In addition to his groundbreaking research on antibiotics, Duchesne also made important contributions to the study of tuberculosis, particularly in the area of immunology. His work helped to establish the importance of the cellular immune response in fighting this disease.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Duchesne's career was cut short by his illness. He died at the age of 37, but his legacy lived on through his research and the work of those he inspired. Today, he is considered one of the great pioneers of modern medicine, and his contributions continue to influence medical research and practice around the world.</p><p>Duchesne was born in a family of doctors, with his father being a prominent surgeon. From a young age, he showed a strong interest in medicine and pursued it as his career. He studied at the Sorbonne, where he obtained degrees in natural sciences and medicine. After completing his studies, Duchesne joined the French Army and served as a medical officer during the First World War. It was during this time that he made his groundbreaking discovery of the antibiotic properties of penicillium glaucum.</p><p>Despite the recognition he received from his colleagues, Duchesne's work went largely unrecognized for many years. It was only after the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in the 1920s that Duchesne's contribution to the field of antibiotics was finally acknowledged.</p><p>In addition to his medical research, Duchesne was also interested in the arts and culture. He was an accomplished piano player and a passionate collector of antique books and manuscripts.</p><p>Despite his short life, Duchesne's work had a profound impact on the field of medicine. Today, he is remembered as a trailblazer in the study of antibiotics and a pioneer in the fight against tuberculosis. His legacy continues to inspire researchers and medical professionals around the world.</p><p>After Duchesne's death, his work on penicillium glaucum was largely forgotten. It wasn't until the 1930s and 1940s that his work was rediscovered and his contributions to the field were fully recognized. In 1944, a year after Fleming was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of penicillin, Duchesne was posthumously awarded the Prix Montyon by the French Academy of Sciences for his pioneering work on antibiotics.</p><p>Despite his relatively short life, Duchesne's legacy has endured. In 1995, the International Society of Chemotherapy established the Duchesne Memorial Lecture, which is given annually in honor of his groundbreaking work in the field of antibiotics. Additionally, in 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the site of Duchesne's former laboratory in Paris, commemorating his contributions to the field of medicine.</p><p>Today, Duchesne serves as a reminder of the power of scientific inquiry, and the importance of recognizing the contributions of those who have come before us. His legacy stands as a testament to the enduring impact of scientific discovery, and the potential for one individual to make a lasting difference in their field.</p><p></p><p>

He was particularly interested in depicting scenes from rural life, and his work often portrayed peasants and laborers engaged in everyday activities. Despite his relatively short career, Bastien-Lepage was an influential figure in the development of French naturalism, and his work had a lasting impact on the development of modern art. Some of his most famous works include "Haymaking," "The Potato Gatherers," and "Joan of Arc."</p><p>Bastien-Lepage was born into a family of artists, and he demonstrated a natural talent for drawing and painting from a young age. He studied art in Paris at the École des Beaux-Arts and later at the atelier of Alexandre Cabanel. His breakthrough work, "The Hayfield," was shown at the Salon in 1878 and became a critical and commercial success. The painting's naturalistic style and attention to detail were a marked departure from the more idealized and romanticized depictions of rural life that were popular at the time.</p><p>In addition to his naturalistic paintings, Bastien-Lepage was also a skilled portraitist and did portraits of many notable figures of his time, including the composer Ambroise Thomas and the poet Anatole France. He was a member of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and was also awarded the Légion d'honneur in 1880.</p><p>Sadly, Bastien-Lepage's career was cut short by his untimely death at the age of 36 from cancer. Despite his short career, his work had a significant impact on the development of modern art, particularly in the naturalism and plein air painting movements. Today, his paintings are housed in major museums and collections around the world, including the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p><p>Bastien-Lepage's work also had an impact beyond the art world. His depiction of rural life and the working class was seen as a political statement, as it challenged the idealized and romanticized images of the French countryside that were prevalent at the time. Bastien-Lepage's work was seen as a celebration of the common people, and his focus on their everyday lives was seen as a commentary on the social issues of the time. </p><p>Bastien-Lepage's influence can be seen in the work of many later artists, including Vincent van Gogh and Édouard Manet. Van Gogh admired Bastien-Lepage's naturalistic approach to painting and began to experiment with similar techniques in his own work. Manet was also influenced by Bastien-Lepage's focus on everyday life and his use of natural light. </p><p>Today, Bastien-Lepage is remembered as one of the key figures in the development of modern art, particularly in France. His naturalistic approach to painting and his focus on the lives of ordinary people helped to challenge the traditional ideals of beauty and subject matter in art.</p><p></p><p>

was
a French
writer and novelist.


					</p><p>Brasillach was a controversial figure due to his collaboration with the Nazi occupation forces during World War II. He was an active supporter of the Vichy regime and contributed to several pro-Nazi publications. After the war ended, he was tried and sentenced for treason and collaboration with the enemy. Despite pleas for clemency from intellectuals such as Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, Brasillach was executed by firing squad in 1945. His legacy remains divisive, with some admiring his literary talents and others condemning his political beliefs and actions.</p><p>Brasillach's writing career began in the 1930s and he gained a reputation as an innovative and talented writer. He worked as a journalist and editor, with his most famous work being the novel "Les Sept Couleurs" (The Seven Colors). Brasillach was also a member of the Académie française, France's most prestigious literary society. </p><p>During the war, Brasillach was involved in the National Popular Rally, a collaborationist group that sought to align France with Nazi Germany. He wrote for the pro-Nazi publication "Je suis partout" (I am everywhere) and actively promoted anti-Semitic and anti-Communist views. </p><p>Despite his controversial views and actions, Brasillach retained a significant following among literary circles, with many arguing that his execution was a violation of free speech and artistic expression. However, others have criticized Brasillach for his collaboration with the Nazis and the harm he caused to French society. </p><p>In recent years, Brasillach's legacy has been re-examined, with some arguing that his literary talents should be evaluated separately from his political views. Nevertheless, his collaboration with the Nazis and his support for their ideology continues to be a source of controversy and debate.</p><p>Brasillach's execution sparked intense debate in France and abroad. Some argued that it was a necessary act to punish collaboration with the enemy and send a message about the value of loyalty to the state. Others saw it as a dangerous precedent that could be used to suppress free speech and artistic expression. In the decades that followed, Brasillach's reputation as a writer and political figure remained split. Some continued to admire his literary talent and lamented his execution, while others denounced him as a fascist and traitor.</p><p>In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Brasillach's life and legacy. Scholars have begun to re-examine his works and his political views, seeking to understand how someone with such extreme ideas could gain a following in France. Some have argued that Brasillach's collaboration with the Nazis was driven by a desire for power and recognition rather than a deeply held belief in their ideology.</p><p>Regardless of one's opinion of Brasillach, his life and work serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of extremism and the need for vigilance in defending democratic values.</p><p></p><p>

Despite his young age, Nicod's philosophical works greatly impacted the field of analytic philosophy, and his contributions remain influential to this day.</p><p>Nicod was born in Paris, France and studied at École Normale Supérieure, where he became interested in philosophy. He also studied mathematics and logic, which heavily influenced his later work. Nicod's most notable work, "Foundations of Geometry and Induction," was published in 1925 posthumously. In this work, Nicod attempted to reconcile mathematics with logic and philosophy, and laid the groundwork for the development of modal logic. Nicod was also a strong advocate for pacifism, and served briefly in the French army during World War I before being discharged on medical grounds. Despite his short life, Nicod made lasting contributions to the fields of philosophy and logic.</p><p>In addition to his contributions in philosophy and logic, Jean Nicod was also an avid art collector and patron. He was particularly interested in modern art movements, and his collection included works by artists such as Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall. Nicod's passion for art was reflected in his philosophical writings, and he believed that art and aesthetics played an important role in human experience and understanding. Nicod was also known for his close relationships with several prominent philosophers of his time, including Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Rudolf Carnap. His untimely death at the age of 30 cut short what could have been a long and fruitful career in philosophy. Despite this, Nicod's legacy continues to inspire generations of philosophers and thinkers.</p><p></p><p>

(April 19, 1849		Paris-May 6, 1883			Paris)

	
		a.k.a. Eva Gonzales

	
was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>She was a prolific painter known for her portraiture and genre scenes, and was also a notable pupil of the Impressionist master, Edouard Manet. Born in Paris, Eva showed an early artistic talent and began studying painting at a young age. In 1869, she became a student of Manet's and quickly became one of his favorite pupils. It was said that he even considered her a sort of surrogate daughter, and the two had a close and affectionate relationship. After studying under Manet, Gonzales went on to have a career of her own, exhibiting her work with the Impressionists and winning recognition for her powerful portraits of young women. Sadly, her promising career was cut short when she died of childbirth complications at the young age of 34. Despite her short life, Gonzales had a significant impact on the art of her time and her legacy continues to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Some of Gonzales' most well-known works include "Child with an Apple" and "The Convalescent." In addition to her painting, she was also a talented pianist and a lover of music, which is reflected in her artwork. Gonzales was also notable for breaking traditional gender roles by pursuing a career in art, which was not a common choice for women during her time. She was married to artist Henri Guérard, who was also a friend and colleague of Manet's. Despite her brief life and career, Gonzales made a significant contribution to the Impressionist movement and paved the way for future generations of female artists.</p><p>Gonzales' work was often noted for its sensitivity and attention to detail. Her portraits of women, in particular, were celebrated for their realism and emotional depth. She was also known for her use of color and light, which were hallmarks of the Impressionist movement. Her paintings often depicted everyday scenes and people, giving an insight into the lives of the working class during her time.</p><p>After her death, much of Gonzales' work was scattered or lost, but in recent years there has been a growing interest in her art. In 2018, the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris held a retrospective of her work, which drew significant attention from the art world. Today, Gonzales is remembered as one of the most talented artists of her generation, and her contributions to the Impressionist movement continue to be celebrated.</p><p></p><p>

(October 28, 1854		France-March 31, 1888)


was
a French
philosopher.


					</p><p>Guyau was born in Laval, France to a family of scholars. He was a precocious student and went on to study at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, where he was drawn towards the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. He published his first major work, 'Critique of Morality,' in 1882, which was highly influenced by Nietzsche's ideas.</p><p>Guyau's philosophical ideas centered around the importance of individualism, freedom, and the pursuit of joy as the highest good. He believed that the pursuit of pleasure was not hedonistic, but a natural human urge that should be embraced to achieve personal fulfillment. His ideas were highly controversial at the time, and he faced criticism from both conservatives and socialists.</p><p>In addition to his work in philosophy, Guyau was also a prolific writer and musician. His book 'The Irreligion of the Future' (1887) was widely read and discussed in intellectual circles. Tragically, Guyau died at the age of 33 from a brain tumor, cutting short a promising career and leaving behind a legacy of bold philosophical thought.</p><p>Guyau's ideas continue to inspire modern philosophers, particularly in the field of ethics. His method of approaching morality through psychology, rather than theology or metaphysics, was groundbreaking in his time and remains influential today. Despite his short life and limited output, Guyau's impact on philosophy has been enduring. His works have been translated into several languages and continue to be studied and debated by scholars around the world. In addition to his philosophical contributions, Guyau's musical compositions gained him recognition in his day, with one of his works winning a national competition in France. Guyau's legacy as a thinker, writer, and musician has left an indelible mark on the cultural landscape of France and beyond.</p><p>Guyau's interest in individualism and his advocacy for personal freedom influenced many other philosophers grappling with similar ideas. He argued that individualism was not a selfish pursuit, but rather a necessary condition for social progress. Guyau's thoughts on individualism and personal fulfillment are often seen as an early precursor to the existentialist movement that emerged later in the 20th century. He was also an early advocate for women's rights, arguing that women should be granted the same freedoms and opportunities as men.</p><p>Guyau's legacy extends beyond philosophy and music into literary criticism. He is credited with being the first to introduce Friedrich Schiller's works to French readership. Guyau was fluent in German and translated many German works into French, including several by Nietzsche. He was also instrumental in popularizing Nietzsche's philosophy in France, where it had a significant impact on the intellectual landscape.</p><p>Today, Guyau is remembered as a pioneering thinker who pushed the boundaries of philosophical inquiry. His ideas on individualism, personal freedom, and the pursuit of joy continue to inspire scholars and thinkers around the world. Despite his short life, Guyau left a lasting legacy and remains an important figure in the history of French philosophy.</p><p></p><p>

novelist.


					</p><p>He was a prominent figure in the Symbolist movement and is best known for his short stories, which were highly praised by writers such as Jorge Luis Borges, Stefan Zweig, and Paul Valéry.

In addition to his literary pursuits, Schwob also worked as a librarian and was instrumental in establishing the Bibliothèque de la Ville de Paris (City Library) as one of the premier libraries in France. Despite his early death at the age of 37 from bone cancer, Marcel Schwob left a lasting legacy in French literature and is considered a major influence on the Surrealist and Modernist movements.</p><p>Schwob's literary works often explored themes of the occult, crime, and other macabre subjects. His most famous work, "The Book of Monelle," is a loosely autobiographical novel about his relationship with a young girl named Monelle who serves as a muse of sorts for the author. Schwob was also known for his mastery of various literary styles, experimenting with different forms of writing such as the epistolary novel and the fable.

His influence can be seen in the work of later writers, such as Jorge Luis Borges, who considered Schwob to be one of his primary influences.</p><p>Despite his impact on French literature, Schwob remained relatively unknown outside of literary circles until the 20th century.
