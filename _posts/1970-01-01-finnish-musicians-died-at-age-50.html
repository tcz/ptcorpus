Despite this, his legacy as a pioneer of Finnish cinema remains strong, and he is remembered as an important contributor to the development of the Finnish film industry.</p><p>Hällström's legacy also extends beyond his own films, as he was a mentor to a number of younger directors who went on to become major figures in Finnish cinema.

He was known for his love of nature and often painted landscapes inspired by the Finnish countryside. His photographs, which were mainly of his family and friends, are also highly regarded for their artistic quality and historical significance.</p><p>Hällström's impact on Finnish cinema has been recognized through numerous accolades, including the establishment of the Roland af Hällström Award, which is awarded annually to a Finnish filmmaker who has made an exceptional contribution to cinema. In 2015, the Finnish Post issued a stamp honoring Hällström's legacy and his contributions to Finnish film.</p><p>Despite living a relatively short life, Hällström's influence on Finnish culture and cinema continues to be felt over 60 years after his death.
