(November 12, 1944		Beekbergen-January 26, 1991			Amsterdam)

	
		also known as Johnny The Selfkicker

	
was
a Dutch
writer.


						</p><p>Van Doorn was known for his experimental writing style, which combined poetry, prose, and performance. He was a key figure in the Dutch literary and cultural scene of the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to his writing, he was also a radio and television personality, and he often performed his work at literary festivals and other events. Despite struggling with mental health issues throughout his life, van Doorn continued to create and inspire others until his premature death at the age of 46. His work remains an important part of Dutch literature and continues to influence writers and artists today.</p><p>Van Doorn's literary career started as a poet in the mid-1960s, where he quickly gained a reputation for his unorthodox, stream-of-consciousness style. His first collection of poetry, "Een Nieuw Vreemd Woord" (A New Strange Word), was published in 1965. In the years that followed, he started experimenting with performance art, which he used to showcase his poetry in a new and unexpected way. </p><p>Van Doorn's most famous alter ego, Johnny The Selfkicker, emerged in the early 1970s. Dressed in a white suit and tie, he would perform his poetry, sometimes accompanied by a live band, in bars, clubs, and theaters across the Netherlands. His performances, which often crossed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in Dutch society at the time, attracted large crowds of fans and followers.</p><p>Despite his success as a writer and performer, van Doorn struggled with alcoholism and mental health issues. During his lifetime, he spent several periods in psychiatric hospitals and received electroshock therapy. In the 1980s, he tried to quit drinking and became increasingly involved in Buddhism, which had a profound impact on his work.</p><p>Van Doorn's legacy in Dutch literature remains significant, both for his innovative style and for his role as a cultural icon. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in his work and his contributions to Dutch counterculture.</p><p>In addition to his poetry and performances, van Doorn also worked as a radio and television personality. He hosted his own radio show, "Het geding van Johnny van Doorn," and appeared on numerous television programs, including the popular talk show "Sonja Barend." He also wrote for several newspapers and magazines, including De Volkskrant and Vrij Nederland. </p><p>Van Doorn was not afraid to tackle controversial topics in his writing and performances, such as sexuality, drug use, and mental illness. He often used his own personal experiences as inspiration for his work, which added a raw and emotional depth to his writing. </p><p>After van Doorn's death in 1991, his legacy continued to grow, and he became a cult figure for a new generation of writers and artists. In 2001, a collection of his poems and performance texts was published under the title "Johnny The Selfkicker: Collected Works." Today, van Doorn is widely recognized as one of the most innovative and influential writers of his generation in the Netherlands.</p><p></p><p>
