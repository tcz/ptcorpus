(June 16, 1842		Santiago de Cuba-November 26, 1911)


was
a French
journalist.


					</p><p>Paul Lafargue was also a politician and a socialist activist. He was married to Laura Marx, daughter of Karl Marx, and was active in the international socialist and communist movements. Lafargue was a member of the French parliament and was instrumental in the establishment of the French Socialist Party. He was also known for his strong opposition to colonialism and imperialism. In addition to his political and social activism, Lafargue was a prolific writer and authored several books and articles. His most famous work is "The Right to be Lazy", in which he argued that the working class should strive towards a society in which work is not viewed as a necessity but rather as a form of pleasure. His death by suicide, along with his wife's, was a highly publicized event that sparked discussions about mental health and the pressures of political activism.</p><p>Born in Cuba to a French father and a Creole mother, Paul Lafargue was raised and educated in France. He became politically active in his youth and was a member of the International Workingmen's Association, also known as the First International. In the 1870s, he became an editor of "Le Socialiste," a socialist newspaper, and later founded "The New Era," a Marxist publication. As a member of parliament from 1890 to 1893, Lafargue pushed for better working conditions and workers' rights, as well as advocating for women's suffrage.</p><p>Lafargue was also known for his sharp wit and sense of humor. He once famously described religion as "the opiate of the people" in a parody of Karl Marx's famous quote. In addition to his political and journalistic work, Lafargue was a prolific translator, translating works by Shakespeare, Dante, and Goethe into French.</p><p>Despite his contributions to the socialist movement, Lafargue felt disillusioned with the direction it was taking in his later years. He and his wife Laura Marx decided to end their lives together, leaving a note that cited their deteriorating health as the reason for their decision. The event sparked controversy and debate within the socialist community, with some questioning the couple's mental state and the pressures of political activism.</p><p>Lafargue was also a strong advocate for women's rights and believed that women should have equal opportunities and access to education and employment. He wrote several articles on the subject and collaborated with his wife, Laura Marx, on various feminist causes. Together, they fought for better working conditions and wages for women and were involved in the founding of the Women's Section of the French Socialist Party.</p><p>Throughout his life, Lafargue remained committed to his socialist ideals and was a vocal critic of capitalism and bourgeois society. He believed that a socialist revolution was necessary to create a more just and equal society and worked tirelessly towards this goal. Despite facing opposition and persecution from the authorities, Lafargue continued to advocate for the rights of workers and the oppressed until the end of his life.</p><p>Today, Lafargue is remembered as an important figure in the history of socialism and the labor movement. His ideas on the value of leisure time and the right to work for pleasure rather than necessity continue to inspire debates and discussions on the nature of work and the role of government in promoting social welfare.</p><p></p><p>

He was highly influential in the art world of his time and his works are still widely exhibited and collected today.</p><p>Laurens began his artistic career as a stonemason before studying at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. His early works were heavily influenced by the Renaissance and the Baroque periods. However, he later became closely associated with the Cubist movement, which was characterized by the use of multiple viewpoints and the distortion of forms. Laurens' cubist sculptures were often of human figures or objects, which he would break down into geometric shapes and reassemble in a new, abstract form.</p><p>During World War I, Laurens served in the French Army and was wounded in the Battle of Verdun. After the war, he became a prominent member of the Parisian art scene and was involved in the founding of several artistic groups including the Abstraction-Création group. In recognition of his significant contributions to the arts, he was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1948.</p><p>Apart from his works as a sculptor and illustrator, Laurens was also a teacher at the Académie Ranson in Paris. Many of his students went on to become prominent artists themselves. Despite suffering from poor health in his later years, Laurens continued to work until his death in 1954 at the age of 69. Today, his works can be found in museums such as the Tate Modern in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p><p>Laurens was also known for his political activism, particularly in the 1930s when he joined the anti-fascist movement. He created works that reflected his political beliefs, such as his sculpture "Head of a Spanish Civil War Soldier" which was a tribute to the soldiers who fought against fascism during the Spanish Civil War.Laurens was also a member of the French Resistance during World War II, using his artistic skills to create counterfeit documents for the movement. He continued to create art during the occupation, but was forced to limit his materials due to shortages. Despite the difficult circumstances, he managed to create a significant body of work during this time.One of Laurens' most well-known works is his sculpture "La Grande Musicienne" (The Great Musician), created between 1938-1939. The large-scale bronze sculpture depicts a seated figure playing a stringed instrument and is now a prominent feature in the sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.Laurens' legacy in the art world continues to inspire and influence artists today. His commitment to experimentation and exploration of new artistic styles, as well as his dedication to political activism and social justice, serve as a reminder of the power of art to both reflect and shape the world around us.</p><p></p><p>
