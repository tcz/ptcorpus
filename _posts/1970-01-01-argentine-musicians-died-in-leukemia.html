His commitment to social justice and human rights was evident in both his music and his political activism. Despite his short life, Masana left a significant impact on Argentine music and culture, and his work continues to inspire new generations of musicians and social activists.</p><p>Masana’s music was known for being emotive and relatable, drawing listeners in with his raw, heartfelt lyrics. He was heavily influenced by other legendary Argentine folk musicians such as Atahualpa Yupanqui and Eduardo Falú. Masana’s style incorporated a mix of traditional instruments such as the guitar and charango with contemporary instruments such as the electric guitar and synthesizer. </p><p>Aside from his successful career in music, Masana also dedicated himself to education. He taught music for a period of time in the early 1970s at the National University of La Plata. He also taught music to children at a community center in the outskirts of Buenos Aires. </p><p>Masana’s impact on Argentine music continues to be recognized today. Many of his songs have been covered by other artists and are considered classics of the Argentine folk music genre. In 2013, a biographical documentary was released titled “Gerardo Masana: Canto de Lucha y Esperanza” (Gerardo Masana: Song of Struggle and Hope), which explores his life and music. Masana's contribution to Argentine music and his commitment to social justice continue to inspire generations of artists and activists in Argentina and beyond.</p><p>Despite his short musical career, Masana was highly regarded in Argentina, and his contribution to the Argentine music industry was highly celebrated. In 1984, the Argentine government created a commemorative postage stamp in his honor, depicting the musician with his guitar. The stamp was released as part of a series commemorating the Argentine Bicentennial.
