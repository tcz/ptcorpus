(February 18, 1869		Oslo-October 7, 1948			Oslo)


was
a Norwegian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a famous marine biologist, oceanographer and a pioneer in the field of fisheries science. He served as a professor of zoology and director of the Norwegian Fisheries Investigation from 1900 to 1914. Throughout his life, Hjort conducted numerous expeditions on fishing, marine biology, and oceanography, including extensive research on Arctic and Antarctic waters. He made significant contributions towards understanding the factors that influenced fish populations and migration patterns, and his work played a crucial role in the development of modern fishery management. Additionally, he was a prolific author, contributing several books and hundreds of scientific papers to the field of fisheries science. His theories and research methods are still considered relevant today by researchers and scholars worldwide. In recognition of his pioneering contributions, Hjort was awarded the prestigious Order of St. Olav by the Norwegian government.</p><p>Hjort was born to a family of academics and his father, Robert Collett, was a well-known zoologist. After completing his education in natural sciences and biology, Hjort embarked on a career in marine research. He was appointed as the director of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea in 1920, where he continued to work until his retirement in 1935. During this time, he worked closely with international organizations, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, to develop policies and regulations for sustainable fishing practices.</p><p>One of Hjort's most significant contributions was his theory of "critical periods," which emphasized the importance of understanding the impact of environmental factors on fish stocks. He hypothesized that fluctuations in oceanic conditions could have a significant impact on fish populations, and that the government should set annual fishing quotas based on these conditions. This theory is still considered a core principle in the field of fisheries management.</p><p>Hjort's other accomplishments include serving as the president of the Norwegian Academy of Sciences and Letters, and being a member of several other prestigious scientific societies, including the Royal Society of London. He also received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the Darwin-Wallace Medal from the Royal Society, and the Hjort Medal, which was established in his honor in 1957.</p><p>Overall, Hjort's contributions to marine science and fisheries management laid the foundation for many of the policies and practices that are still in use today. His legacy continues to inspire scientists and policymakers around the world to strive towards sustainable resource management and conservation.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Johan Hjort was also a passionate advocate for the arts. He was a skilled musician, playing the violin and piano, and was a patron of the arts in Norway. He was also a cultural historian and wrote extensively on the history of Norwegian music and the arts.</p><p>During World War II, Hjort was a vocal opponent of Nazi Germany and became involved in the Norwegian resistance movement. He risked his own safety by helping Jewish refugees and hiding resistance fighters on his property. His actions earned him recognition as a hero of the resistance and posthumously, he was awarded the King's Medal of Merit for his bravery.</p><p>Johan Hjort's contributions to the fields of marine biology, oceanography, and fisheries science continue to be studied and implemented today. His detailed research and scientific theories helped establish sustainable fishing practices around the world and his legacy has left an indelible mark on the scientific community.</p><p>Hjort was also known for his strong commitment to education and was involved in various academic institutions. He played a key role in establishing the Norwegian College of Fisheries in Tromsø, and was instrumental in its growth and development. Hjort's dedication to education extended beyond his formal teaching positions as he mentored many young researchers and scientists, inspiring them to pursue careers in marine science and fisheries management. </p><p>Hjort's legacy is still celebrated today in Norway and around the world, with various institutions and organizations named in his honor. His contributions to the field of marine science have been recognized as a major factor in the development of sustainable fishing practices worldwide. Hjort's life and work continue to inspire future generations of scientists and policymakers, who are committed to preserving and protecting our planet's precious marine ecosystems.</p><p></p><p>
