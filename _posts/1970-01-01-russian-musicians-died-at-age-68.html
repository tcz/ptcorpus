(July 14, 1872		Moscow-December 2, 1940			Saint Petersburg)


was
a Russian
personality.


					</p><p>Nikolai Koltsov was a prominent Russian biologist and biochemist who is known for his pioneering work in genetics and molecular biology. He was a contemporary of famous scientists such as James Watson, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin, and his research laid the foundation for the discoveries that led to the structure of DNA.</p><p>Koltsov studied medicine and biology at the University of Moscow, where he received his PhD in 1900. He went on to work as a researcher at several institutions in Russia and throughout Europe, including the Pasteur Institute in Paris.</p><p>Koltsov is credited with being the first scientist to propose the concept of a "genetic code", which he referred to as the "biochemical alphabet". He also conducted research on the structure of DNA and RNA, and was among the first to suggest that DNA was a helix.</p><p>Despite his groundbreaking contributions to science, Koltsov's career was cut short by political turmoil in Russia. He was persecuted by the Soviet government for refusing to renounce his belief in the theory of genetics, which was deemed incompatible with communist ideology. Koltsov was ultimately executed under mysterious circumstances, with some speculating that he was poisoned by agents of the Soviet government.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in poison.

Carolyne became renowned for her intellect, wit, and charm, and was admired by many, including the composer Franz Liszt, with whom she had a passionate but ultimately doomed love affair. She is perhaps best known for her relationship with the composer Richard Wagner, whom she met in 1853 and supported financially and emotionally for the rest of her life. Together they developed the concept of the "Gesamtkunstwerk," or total artwork, which inspired Wagner's music dramas. Carolyne was a vocal advocate for his work and helped to advance his career despite opposition from critics and the public. After Wagner's death, Carolyne moved to Rome, where she devoted herself to Catholicism and established a religious community dedicated to the education of young women.</p><p></p><p>
