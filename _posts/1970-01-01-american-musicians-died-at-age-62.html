(June 23, 1894		Hoboken-August 25, 1956			Bloomington)


was
an American
psychologist, scientist, professor, researcher and biologist.


					</p><p>Kinsey is most commonly known for his ground-breaking work in human sexuality research. He is the author of two books, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), which are collectively known as the Kinsey Reports. These books were significant for their time and are still widely discussed and referenced in modern-day debates on sexuality.</p><p>Kinsey was also a professor at Indiana University, where he founded the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, which remains a leading center for research on these topics to this day. His work had a significant impact on the fields of psychology, sociology, and human sexuality research, and he is widely regarded as a trailblazer in this area of scientific inquiry.</p><p>During his early career, Kinsey studied and conducted research on gall wasps, eventually becoming an expert in the field. However, it was his later work in human sexuality that earned him international recognition. Kinsey's research was focused on breaking down taboos and exploring the diversity of human sexual behavior. He achieved this by conducting extensive interviews and surveys of thousands of men and women, collecting data on their sexual histories and practices. The Kinsey Reports challenged traditional beliefs about sexual behavior and helped to pave the way for more open discussion and understanding of sexuality. Despite facing backlash from conservative critics, Kinsey's work contributed greatly to the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s. Today, Kinsey is remembered as a pioneering figure in the fight for sexual freedom and acceptance.</p><p></p><p>

(April 22, 1904		New York City-February 18, 1967			Princeton)

	
		a.k.a. J. Robert Oppenheimer, Father of the Atomic Bomb, Julius Robert Oppenheimer or Robert Oppenheimer

	
was
an American
physicist, scientist and theoretical physicist.


					
			
		His children
		are
		called
		Peter Oppenheimer and Katherine Oppenheimer.

						</p><p>Oppenheimer played a crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II as the director of the Manhattan Project, overseeing the construction and testing of the first atomic bombs. He was later criticized and had his security clearance revoked during the Red Scare due to his associations with leftist political groups and opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb. Despite this setback, he continued his research in theoretical physics and became a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University. Oppenheimer was awarded numerous honors throughout his career, including the National Medal of Science in 1963.</p><p>Oppenheimer was born into a wealthy family and was educated at Harvard University and the University of Cambridge in England. He later returned to the United States to teach physics at the University of California, Berkeley. Oppenheimer's work in theoretical physics focused on the study of subatomic particles and the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic level.</p><p>Despite his contributions to the wartime effort and his role in shaping modern physics, Oppenheimer's legacy remains complicated. His involvement in the development of the atomic bomb sparked a debate about the ethics of using such a devastating weapon, and his later activism and opposition to nuclear proliferation made him a controversial figure. Nevertheless, his contributions to science and his work on behalf of peace continue to be recognized and studied today.</p><p></p><p>
