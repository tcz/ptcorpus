He was selected by NASA in 1962 to be part of the second group of astronauts, known as the New Nine. </p><p>On July 20, 1969, Armstrong became the first person to step onto the moon, famously proclaiming "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. Armstrong also received the Robert J. Collier Trophy, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, and the Elliott Cresson Medal from the Franklin Institute. In addition to his work in aviation and space exploration, Armstrong was also actively involved in the Boy Scouts of America and served as a member of its National Executive Board. After retiring from NASA, he became a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati and served on various commissions and advisory groups. Armstrong suffered from heart complications and underwent bypass surgery in August 2012, just days before his death on August 25, 2012, at the age of 82.</p><p>Armstrong's journey to become an astronaut started in 1955 when he applied to the astronaut training program but was turned down because NASA was only accepting test pilots at the time. Armstrong became a test pilot and applied again in 1962, being accepted as part of NASA's second group of astronauts. Before stepping onto the moon, Armstrong had to manually land the lunar module, known as Eagle, after encountering a rocky and boulder-filled terrain. His calm and precise handling of the situation ensured the success of the mission. After his historic moon landing, Armstrong played a key role in investigating the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster as part of the Rogers Commission. Armstrong's contributions to aerospace and space exploration have been legendary, and he will always be remembered as one of humanity's most celebrated heroes.</p><p>Armstrong's legacy extends beyond his monumental achievement of being the first human to set foot on the moon. He was deeply committed to advancing the field of aviation and space exploration, and was a tireless advocate for science education. In addition to his teaching and advisory work, Armstrong also served as a member of the board of directors for several companies, including Learjet and Cincinnati Bell. He was also the author of several books, including his memoir, "First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong," which was published in 2005. Armstrong's impact on American culture and history is immeasurable, and his courage and pioneering spirit continue to inspire generations of people around the world.</p><p></p><p>
