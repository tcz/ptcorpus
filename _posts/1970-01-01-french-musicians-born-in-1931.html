(December 28, 1931		Paris-November 30, 1994			Bellevue-la-Montagne)

	
		otherwise known as Guy-Ernest Debord, G.E. Debord or Guy Ernest Debord

	
was
a French
philosopher, screenwriter, film director and writer.


						</p><p>He is best known as the founder and key member of the Situationist International, a group of artists, writers and intellectuals who rejected mainstream culture and promoted radical politics in the 1950s and 60s. Debord's most influential work was the book "The Society of the Spectacle," which critiques the culture of consumerism and the effects of media on society. He also directed two films, "Hurlements en Faveur de Sade" and "Critique de la Separation," and wrote several other books including "Comments on the Society of the Spectacle" and "Panegyric." Debord died by suicide in 1994 at age 62. His ideas and works continue to influence contemporary cultural and political movements around the world.</p><p>Debord's early life was marked by political activism and anti-authoritarianism. He was heavily involved in the Lettrist movement, which sought to subvert social norms through experimental art and literature. In 1957, he and other members of the Lettrist movement merged with several other avant-garde groups to form the Situationist International. The SI quickly became known for its radicalism and its critique of consumer culture, urbanism, and the state.</p><p>Debord's work on the spectacle and the society of the spectacle has been influential across a wide range of fields, from media studies to urban planning. In essence, Debord argued that modern life is defined by a kind of relentless image-making: we are constantly bombarded with images and messages that shape our desires, beliefs, and behaviors. These images, in turn, reinforce the power structures of capitalism and the state, keeping us docile and disconnected from one another. Debord believed that the only way to resist the society of the spectacle was to engage in radical forms of subversion and create new ways of living.</p><p>Debord's films, while not well-known, were also notable for their experimentalism and their rejection of traditional narrative structures. Hurlements en Faveur de Sade (Howls for Sade) was a collaboration with Spanish filmmaker Jorgen Leth, and was a heavily abstracted portrayal of Sade's life and work. Critique de la Separation (Critique of Separation) was similarly unconventional, combining found footage, text, and voice-over narration to explore themes of isolation and detachment.</p><p>Although Debord's ideas and work have been criticized for their sometimes dogmatic and confrontational nature, they remain influential both in academic circles and in activist communities. Many of his concepts have been taken up by contemporary social movements, from Occupy Wall Street to the Yellow Vests in France. Debord's legacy is a complex one, but there is no doubt that his work has had a lasting impact on our understanding of media, politics, and social change.</p><p>In addition to his activism and artistic pursuits, Debord was also a prolific writer. He authored several books and essays on topics ranging from art and culture to politics and revolution. "Comments on the Society of the Spectacle" was a follow-up to his seminal work, expanding on and refining his ideas about the ways in which images and media shape our perceptions of reality. "Panegyric," written after his departure from the Situationist International, was a deeply personal reflection on his own life and experiences. It has been described as a mixture of autobiography, philosophy, and poetry. </p><p>Debord's personal life was often tumultuous. He struggled with alcoholism and had several failed relationships. His suicide in 1994, at his home in Bellevue-la-Montagne, came as a shock to many of his closest friends and allies. However, it also served to solidify his legacy as a radical thinker and activist. Many of his admirers saw his suicide as a final act of rebellion against a society that he had spent his life critiquing and attempting to subvert. </p><p>Today, Debord's ideas continue to be debated and discussed in academic and activist circles around the world. His critiques of consumer culture and mass media have become even more relevant in the digital age, where the lines between reality and fiction are increasingly blurred. Debord's influence can be seen in a variety of contemporary cultural movements, from the punk and post-punk scenes of the 1970s and 80s to the current resurgence of interest in the Situationists and their ideas. Regardless of one's opinions of his work or politics, there is no denying that Guy Debord left an indelible mark on the world of art, philosophy, and political activism.</p><p></p><p>

Despite his success, Japrisot was known for his reclusiveness, rarely giving interviews or making public appearances. He passed away in 2003 at the age of 71.</p><p>Japrisot's interest in writing began at a young age, and he published his first novel, "Les Mal Partis," in 1957. In addition to his career as a novelist, Japrisot also worked as a screenwriter, collaborating on several films with director Marcel Carné. His directorial debut came in 1974 with "La Dame dans l'Auto avec des Lunettes et un Fusil" (The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun).</p><p>Japrisot's writing was notable for its complex narrative structure and psychological depth. His works often delved into themes of memory, identity, and the nature of truth. His novel "Trap for Cinderella" is considered a classic of the psychological thriller genre, and was adapted for film twice, in 1965 and 2013.</p><p>In addition to his literary and cinematic work, Japrisot was also an accomplished painter and photographer. His art was exhibited in galleries throughout France, and he frequently incorporated his own photographs and drawings into his novels.</p><p>Despite his private nature, Japrisot remains a beloved figure in French literature and cinema. His works continue to be studied and adapted, and his legacy as one of the greatest suspense writers of the 20th century endures.</p><p>Japrisot's interest in writing was sparked by his love of cinema, which he first developed while watching American films during World War II. He became fascinated with the way films told stories, and this influenced his own approach to writing. He often described his works as "cinematic novels," and many of his novels, such as "The 10:30 from Marseille" and "A Very Long Engagement," have been adapted for film.</p><p>In addition to his literary and cinematic achievements, Japrisot was also a political activist. He was a member of the French Communist Party for a time, and his leftist views often found their way into his works. He was particularly critical of French society and government, and his novels frequently explore issues of class, power, and corruption.</p><p>Japrisot was a private person who shunned publicity and rarely gave interviews. He was known for his eccentricities, such as wearing a hat and dark glasses in public to avoid being recognized. Despite his enigmatic reputation, he was reportedly a warm and generous person to those who knew him well.</p><p></p><p>

a French
illustrator, artist, writer, author, actor and visual artist.


						</p><p>He is known for his humorous and sometimes controversial books for children, such as "The Three Robbers" and "Moon Man," as well as his political and satirical artwork. Ungerer's work often explores complex and challenging themes, such as war, sexuality, and racism, and has been praised for its subversive and thought-provoking nature. In addition to his career as an artist and writer, Ungerer has also worked extensively as a designer and advertising creative director. He has received numerous awards throughout his career, including the Hans Christian Andersen Award, and his work is held in collections around the world.</p><p>Ungerer was born in Strasbourg, France, and grew up in a bilingual Franco-German family. He began drawing at a young age and showed a natural talent for the arts. Ungerer briefly studied art in Strasbourg before moving to New York City in 1956 to pursue his career as an artist. </p><p>Ungerer's early work was focused on advertising, creating successful ad campaigns for clients such as Ford and The New York Times. However, he soon turned his focus to children's books and began publishing some of his most famous works, including "The Three Robbers," "Moon Man," and "Crictor." </p><p>While he is best known for his work as an author and illustrator, Ungerer has also made significant contributions to the field of poster design.

Despite this, his books have been translated into 28 languages and are considered classics of children's literature. Ungerer's political activism extended to his art as well, with his satirical illustrations often criticizing war, authoritarianism, and corruption. He also created posters advocating for peace and nuclear disarmament during the Cold War era. Later in life, Ungerer returned to his hometown of Strasbourg and established the Tomi Ungerer Museum there, which houses a collection of his work and hosts exhibitions and events. His influence is still felt in the worlds of illustration, children's literature, and political art.</p><p></p><p>
