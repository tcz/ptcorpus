					</p><p>Born in Liptovský Mikuláš, which was then a part of Hungary, Martin Rázus grew up in a family of Slovak intellectuals. He studied theology in Bratislava and then worked as a Lutheran priest in several Slovak towns. </p><p>Rázus was an important representative of Slovak literature between the world wars. He wrote not only prose but also poetry, essays, and political commentaries. He was especially known for his depictions of the countryside, its people, and their customs. </p><p>Rázus's work reflected his commitment to social justice and human rights, which often landed him in conflict with the authorities. He was critical of the First Czechoslovak Republic's policies towards the Slovak minority and advocated for greater autonomy for Slovakia. </p><p>In addition to his literary career, Rázus was also involved in politics. He served as a delegate to the Czechoslovak parliament and was a member of several political parties. He died in Brezno in 1937 at the age of 48.</p><p>Rázus was also involved in the cultural life of Slovakia. He was a co-founder of the cultural association Hlasy (Voices) and the Slovak Writers' Association. Rázus's literary debut was in 1907 with the poetry collection Z očí do očí (Eye to Eye). Some of his most famous works include the novel Železný kríž (Iron Cross) and the collection of short stories and essays S nami boli... (They Were With Us...). Rázus's writing was inspired by Slovak folk traditions, as well as by his travels around Europe and the United States. He was an advocate for the use of the Slovak language in literature and pushed for the establishment of a Slovak cultural autonomous unit within Czechoslovakia. Despite his short life, Martin Rázus left a rich literary legacy and is considered one of the most important figures in Slovak literature.</p><p>Rázus's literary work was not limited to fiction and poetry. He also wrote about politics and social issues, often using his platform to champion the rights of the working class and promote equality among all citizens. In addition to his writing, Rázus was also renowned for his oratory skills, and he delivered many impassioned speeches advocating for social justice and Slovak autonomy. He was a respected figure both within and outside of Slovakia, and his work continues to be celebrated in the country today. Among the numerous honors he has received posthumously are having a high school in Brezno named after him, a statue erected in his honor in Liptovský Mikuláš, and his portrait featured on the 20 Slovak koruna note. Rázus's legacy endures as an inspiration to a new generation of Slovak writers and intellectuals who continue to carry on his tradition of using the written word to advocate for social change and promote cultural identity.</p><p>Additionally, Martin Rázus was a polyglot who was fluent in several languages, including German, Hungarian, English, and French. He used his language skills to translate literary works from other languages into Slovak, including works by Russian writers Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Rázus's interest in literature and languages led him to travel extensively throughout Europe and the United States, where he engaged with other writers and intellectuals. His travels also allowed him to gain a deeper understanding of different cultures and social issues, which he incorporated into his writing. Despite his intellectual pursuits, Rázus remained deeply rooted in his Slovak identity and culture, which is evident in his writing that celebrates the traditions and values of the Slovak people. Overall, Martin Rázus was a multifaceted figure whose contributions to Slovak literature and culture continue to be felt today.</p><p>Furthermore, Rázus was a committed pacifist who opposed war and violence. During World War I, he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian army but refused to fight on moral grounds. He was subsequently imprisoned and faced persecution for his beliefs. His experiences during the war and imprisonment deeply influenced his later work and reinforced his commitment to social justice and the promotion of peace. Rázus's writings on pacifism and internationalism were ahead of their time and continue to inspire activists today. His legacy reflects his dedication to social issues, his love for the Slovak people, and his unwavering optimism in the face of adversity.</p><p></p><p>
