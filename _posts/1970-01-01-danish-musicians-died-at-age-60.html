					</p><p>He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1926 for his discovery of the Spiroptera carcinoma, a parasitic roundworm that causes cancer in rats.

He was a member of the Social Democratic party and advocated for public health initiatives and workers' rights. He supported universal suffrage and even ran for office in the Danish parliament.</p><p>Fibiger's legacy is complicated, as his initial discovery was ultimately proven to be incorrect. However, his work paved the way for further exploration of the link between parasites and cancer. He also made significant contributions to the study of tuberculosis and leprosy, and his work led to the development of new treatments for these diseases.</p><p>Today, Fibiger's name is still recognized in the field of cancer research, and his contributions to medical science continue to be studied and analyzed.</p><p>Fibiger was married to Ina Christine Mathilde Hasselbalch, with whom he had two daughters. His daughter, Marie Fibiger, went on to become a well-known feminist, journalist, and translator. Fibiger was also a prolific writer, having published multiple books and research papers throughout his career. He was an active member of numerous scientific societies, including the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters and the Danish Society of Pathology. In recognition of his contributions to science, he was awarded multiple honors and awards, including the Knight's Cross of the Dannebrog Order and honorary doctorates from the Universities of Edinburgh and Giessen.
