(December 9, 1902		Sarzana-November 19, 1945)


was
an Italian
lawyer.


					</p><p>He was also an anti-fascist and a member of the Italian Resistance during World War II. Biggini was actively involved in underground activities against the fascist regime, and was eventually arrested by the Gestapo and deported to the Mauthausen concentration camp. He survived the camp and returned to Italy after the war ended, but tragically died in a car accident shortly after his return. Biggini remains a symbol of the sacrifice and courage of the Italian Resistance during the war.</p><p>Carlo Alberto Biggini was born in the small Italian town of Sarzana, in Liguria, in 1902. He graduated in law from the University of Genoa in 1924 and started practicing as a lawyer in his hometown. However, he did not limit his work to legal services and took an active part in various political and social initiatives.</p><p>In the 1920s and 1930s, Italy was ruled by Benito Mussolini's fascist government, which suppressed all forms of dissent and opposition. Biggini, who was a firm believer in democratic values, became increasingly active in anti-fascist activities. He joined the clandestine network of the Italian Resistance, which was formed to resist the fascist regime and prepare for the possible Allied invasion.</p><p>During World War II, Biggini was involved in various underground activities, such as distributing anti-fascist leaflets, organizing strikes and demonstrations, and providing intelligence to the Allies. However, in 1944, he was arrested by the Gestapo, the German secret police, and deported to the Mauthausen concentration camp, in Austria. In the camp, he endured brutal living conditions, forced labor, and torture, but he managed to survive until the camp was liberated by the Allies in May 1945.</p><p>After his liberation, Biggini returned to Italy, where he was hailed as a hero by the anti-fascists and the Resistance. He resumed his legal practice and helped many former prisoners, refugees, and victims of the war to rebuild their lives. Unfortunately, his life was cut short by a car accident, which occurred in November 1945, just six months after his liberation. He was only 43 years old.</p><p>Carlo Alberto Biggini's legacy lives on as a symbol of courage, sacrifice, and commitment to freedom and justice. His name is inscribed on the Monument to the Resistance and Deportation, in Milan, which honors the memory of the Italian Resistance fighters and the victims of the Nazi and fascist oppression.</p><p>In addition to his involvement in the Resistance, Carlo Alberto Biggini was also a prominent member of the Italian Socialist Party. He was committed to social justice and democracy, and he saw his anti-fascist struggle as an integral part of a larger struggle for a better world. He was also a passionate advocate for human rights and worked to defend the rights of political prisoners and minorities. During his time in Mauthausen, he organized resistance activities and supported his fellow prisoners, earning the respect and admiration of many. After the war, he continued to fight for justice and participated in the trials of war criminals and collaborators. Today, his memory is celebrated by the Italian people, who remember him as a martyr and a hero.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1580		Mantua-December 12, 1622			Rome)


was
an Italian
painter, artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is famous for his innovative works of art and his contributions to the development of the Baroque style in painting. Manfredi was a student of the renowned painter Caravaggio and his works often featured dramatic scenes with strong, contrasting lighting and intense emotional expressions on the faces of his subjects. He was known for his skill in painting human figures, often depicting them engaged in dramatic actions such as gambling or playing music. Despite his success as an artist, Manfredi struggled financially for much of his life and was often forced to work for low wages. Today, his works can be found in museums all over the world, including the Louvre in Paris and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Manfredi's early works were heavily influenced by Caravaggio's dramatic use of light and dark contrasts, which he later developed into his own distinct style. In the early 1600s, he established his own workshop in Rome where he began to receive commissions from various churches and wealthy patrons. Apart from his large-scale paintings, Manfredi also produced many small-scale genre scenes, which were popular among art collectors and enthusiasts of the time. </p><p>Manfredi's most notable works include "The Cardsharps," which depicts gamblers playing cards, and "The Concert," which portrays musicians playing instruments. His paintings were often criticized for their realism and moral ambiguity, and he was accused of glorifying the vices of his subjects. Despite this, Manfredi's innovative use of chiaroscuro and his ability to depict raw human emotion elevated him to the ranks of the most esteemed painters of his time.</p><p>During his lifetime, Manfredi's works were highly coveted, and he received many orders for his paintings. Today, he is regarded as one of the most important figures in Italian Baroque art, and his works continue to captivate art lovers and collectors around the world.</p><p>Manfredi's life was not without its controversies. In 1606, he was arrested for carrying weapons, which was a serious offense at the time. After being released from prison, he collaborated with Caravaggio on a painting called "The Calling of St. Matthew," which is now considered to be one of the most important works in the Baroque style. However, it is said that the two artists had a falling out over the direction of the painting, and Manfredi was left to finish the work on his own. Despite this setback, Manfredi continued to produce innovative and influential works of art throughout his career.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to the world of art, Manfredi was also known for his generosity and compassion. He was known to offer food and shelter to the poor and homeless who often gathered outside his studio. It is said that he would often give away his own paintings to those in need.</p><p>Manfredi's legacy continues to inspire artists to this day, and his unique style and approach to painting continue to be studied and admired by art scholars and enthusiasts around the world.</p><p></p><p>
