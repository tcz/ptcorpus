(April 15, 1793		Altona, Hamburg-November 23, 1864)


was
a Danish
scientist and astronomer.


					
			
		His children
		are
		called
		Otto Wilhelm von Struve and Karl von Struve.

						</p><p>Friedrich Wilhelm von Struve is best known for his contributions to astronomy. He was instrumental in founding the Pulkovo Observatory in St. Petersburg, which became one of the world's most important astronomical observatories under his leadership. Struve was a pioneer in the study of binary stars, which are pairs of stars that orbit around a common center of mass. He catalogued thousands of binary stars and was the first to measure the distance to a star using parallax, a technique which is still used today. Struve also made important contributions to the study of the Earth's magnetic field and the determination of longitude using astronomical observations. His work earned him many honors, including the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Copley Medal of the Royal Society.</p><p>In addition to his scientific accomplishments, Friedrich Wilhelm von Struve played an important role in the development of astronomy education. He established the first observatory at the University of Dorpat, where he also taught astronomy, and he trained many students who later became well-known astronomers themselves. Struve was also active in international scientific organizations, serving as the President of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Director of the Central Bureau for the International Service of Latitudes. He was a respected figure in the scientific community, and his work had a lasting impact on astronomy and related fields. His legacy continues to be recognized and celebrated today, with many astronomical objects named after him, including a crater on the Moon and an asteroid in the asteroid belt.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and educational contributions, Friedrich Wilhelm von Struve was a passionate advocate for international scientific collaboration. He believed in the importance of sharing scientific knowledge and resources across borders, and he worked tirelessly to establish and maintain partnerships with scientists and observatories in other countries. In recognition of his efforts, he was awarded the prestigious Lalande Prize by the French Academy of Sciences in 1826. </p><p>Struve's family also made significant contributions to the field of astronomy. His father, Johann Struve, was a noted astronomer who founded the private observatory in Altona where Friedrich was born. His son Otto went on to become Director of the Pulkovo Observatory and continued his father's work on binary stars. His grandson, Gustav Struve, was a leader of the German Revolution of 1848 and later emigrated to the United States where he became involved in politics.</p><p>Today, Friedrich Wilhelm von Struve is remembered as one of the most important astronomers of the 19th century and a pioneer in the field of astrophysics. His work laid the foundation for many of the discoveries and advancements made in astronomy over the past two centuries.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and educational pursuits, Friedrich Wilhelm von Struve was also a skilled observer of the night sky. He spent countless hours studying stars and galaxies, and was particularly interested in the structure and evolution of our Milky Way galaxy. His observations of star clusters and nebulae helped to confirm the concept of interstellar absorption, which explains why distant objects appear fainter and redder than expected. Struve also discovered several comets, including one that bears his name (Comet 51P/Harrington–Struve). </p><p>Beyond his scientific work, Struve was devoted to his family and was known for his kind and generous nature. He was a loving husband to his wife Emilie and a devoted father to his four sons and two daughters. Struve also had a passion for music, and was an accomplished pianist and organist. His love of music led him to establish a music school in his hometown of Dorpat, which provided training in both vocal and instrumental music.</p><p>Today, the legacy of Friedrich Wilhelm von Struve continues to inspire scientists and astronomers around the world. His pioneering work in binary stars, stellar dynamics, and astrophysics laid the groundwork for many of the major discoveries in modern astrophysics. Struve's commitment to international collaboration and his dedication to education and public outreach serve as a reminder that science is a global enterprise, and that the pursuit of knowledge requires the cooperation of people from all backgrounds and cultures.</p><p>Throughout his career, Friedrich Wilhelm von Struve received many awards for his contributions to astronomy and science. In addition to the medals mentioned earlier, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society of London, the French Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Struve also received honorary degrees from several universities, including the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge.</p><p>In 1844, Struve published his seminal work, "Etudes d'astronomie Stellaire," which became a foundational text in the study of binary stars. The book contained a comprehensive catalog of over 3,000 binary stars and included detailed observations and analysis of their orbits and properties. Struve's pioneering research in binary stars laid the foundation for the modern field of stellar dynamics, which seeks to understand the formation and evolution of stellar systems.</p><p>In addition to his scientific pursuits, Struve was also an advocate for social justice and reform. He supported the abolition of serfdom in Russia and was critical of the government's handling of social and political issues. Struve's views on social justice were shaped by his upbringing in a family of German Lutherans who valued education and freedom of thought.</p><p>Friedrich Wilhelm von Struve passed away in 1864 at the age of 71. His contributions to astronomy and his dedication to international cooperation and education have had a lasting impact on the field of science. Today, astronomers continue to build on Struve's legacy and explore the mysteries of the universe using the techniques and tools he helped to develop.</p><p>One of Friedrich Wilhelm von Struve's notable accomplishments was the creation of the Struve Geodetic Arc, a chain of survey triangulations that stretched from Hammerfest in Norway to the Black Sea, spanning ten countries. The survey was intended to measure the size and shape of the Earth, and it was one of the most significant geodetic projects of the 19th century. The survey was started by Struve's father, Johann Struve, in 1816 and was completed by Friedrich in 1855. The Struve Geodetic Arc was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005 in recognition of its scientific and cultural importance.</p><p>Along with his scientific pursuits, Struve also led a distinguished administrative career. He served as the Director of the Dorpat Observatory from 1819 to 1839, overseeing the construction of several new instruments and the training of young astronomers. Struve's leadership of the Pulkovo Observatory from 1839 to 1862 saw the institution grow into one of the premier astronomical observatories in the world. Under his guidance, the observatory's scientific programs expanded, and new instruments were built, including a large refracting telescope with a 30-inch (76 cm) aperture that was the largest in the world at the time. Struve also played an important role in advancing the use of telegraphy in astronomy, which allowed for more rapid communication between observatories and facilitated collaborative research.</p><p>Struve's contributions to astronomy and science have been recognized through numerous honors and awards. In addition to the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Copley Medal of the Royal Society, he was awarded the Rumford Medal by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Valz Prize by the French Academy of Sciences. Struve was also a member of several prestigious scientific societies, including the Royal Astronomical Society of London, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and the National Academy of Sciences of the United States.</p><p>Overall, Friedrich Wilhelm von Struve's influence on astronomy, geodesy, and scientific collaboration continues to be felt today.

He was known for his elaborate stage shows that often involved live animals, acrobats, and other performers.</p><p>In addition to his work as a magician, Dante was also a prolific inventor, creating a number of new illusions and magic tricks that are still used by performers today.</p><p>Despite his success, Dante faced his fair share of challenges throughout his life, including financial difficulties and health problems. Nevertheless, he continued to perform and innovate until his death in 1955.</p><p>Today, Dante is remembered as one of the most influential magicians of the 20th century, and his legacy lives on through the many performers who have been inspired by his work.</p><p>Dante was also known for his generosity and kindness towards other magicians, often taking on apprentices and providing them with opportunities to learn and perform alongside him. He was a founding member of the Society of American Magicians, and was recognized by his peers as a leader in the field of magic.</p><p>Dante's influence on the world of magic extended beyond just his performances, as he also published several books on magic and illusion, including "The Art of Magic" and "Dante's Mysteries". These books have become classics in the field and are still used as reference material by magicians today.</p><p>Throughout his career, Dante performed for many notable figures, including Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, as well as celebrities like Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. His performances were often accompanied by lavish sets and costumes, and featured a mix of drama, comedy, and suspense.</p><p>Dante's legacy continues to be celebrated by magicians around the world, and his impact on the art of magic can still be seen in the many large-scale illusions and theatrical performances that are popular today.</p><p>Despite being a performer, Dante was notoriously private and guarded about his personal life. However, it is known that he was married twice, first to a fellow magician named Julie Kellar and later to another performer named Estelle Brown. He also had at least one child, a daughter named June who followed in his footsteps as a magician.After his death, Dante's collection of magic props and memorabilia was sold to a private collector, ensuring that his legacy and contributions to the world of magic would be preserved for future generations. In 2018, a documentary film about his life and career called "Dante: The Great Magician" was released, further cementing his place as one of the most legendary figures in the history of magic.</p><p>Despite facing financial difficulties throughout his life, Dante was known for his extravagant spending habits and love of luxury. He owned several homes and drove a fleet of cars, including a customized Rolls Royce that he used in his performances. He was also known for his sharp wit and sense of humor, and was a favorite among his fellow magicians for his entertaining stories and pranks. In addition to his work as a magician, Dante was also an avid traveler, and throughout his career he visited and performed in countries all around the world.

He also played a significant role in elevating the status of magicians and promoting their craft. In the early 20th century, magicians were often viewed as little more than con artists or charlatans, and the art of magic was not taken seriously by the public or literary establishment. Dante worked to change this perception, arguing that magic was a legitimate art form that required talent, skill, and creativity. To this end, he founded the International Guild of Prestidigitators, an organization that aimed to promote excellence in magic and provide support and mentorship to aspiring magicians. Today, the organization is known as the International Brotherhood of Magicians, and it continues to serve as a resource for magicians around the world.</p><p>Dante's vision for the art of magic was grounded in a deep respect for tradition, combined with a willingness to innovate and experiment. He drew inspiration from the great magicians of the past, studying their techniques and adapting them to suit his own style. He was particularly enamored of the work of Robert-Houdin, the legendary French magician who is widely regarded as the father of modern magic. Like Robert-Houdin, Dante believed that magic was an art that should be used to educate and entertain, rather than to deceive or defraud.</p><p>Dante's commitment to excellence in his craft earned him the respect and admiration of his peers, and he was widely regarded as one of the greatest magicians of his time. He was posthumously inducted into the Society of American Magicians Hall of Fame in 1961, and his legacy continues to inspire and influence magicians to this day.
