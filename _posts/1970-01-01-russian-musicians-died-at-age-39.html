									</h1><p>Here are 10 famous musicians from Russian Empire died at 39:</p><h2>Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter</h2><p><strong>Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter</strong>
(January 21, 1884		Riga-November 9, 1923			Munich)


was
a Russian
politician and diplomat.


					</p><p>He is best known for his association with Adolf Hitler during the early years of the Nazi Party. In 1919, Scheubner-Richter met Hitler in a beer hall in Munich and was immediately drawn to his ideas of uniting Germany and regaining its former glory. Scheubner-Richter quickly became one of Hitler's most trusted and loyal supporters, serving as his personal advisor and diplomat.</p><p>During the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, Scheubner-Richter accompanied Hitler on his march through Munich and was shot and killed by police alongside him. Despite his relatively unknown status, Scheubner-Richter was later venerated by the Nazi Party as a martyr and hero.</p><p>Prior to his involvement with the Nazi Party, Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter had a successful career as a diplomat. He had graduated from Oxford University and worked as a German consul in various countries, including Persia and Turkey. It was during his time in Turkey that he witnessed the Armenian Genocide, which deeply affected him and led him to become a fervent nationalist.</p><p>In addition to his diplomatic work, Scheubner-Richter was a prolific writer and journalist, publishing articles on various political and economic topics. He was also a member of several right-wing organizations in Germany and other countries, including the Thule Society, which was known for its occult beliefs and was later co-opted by the Nazi Party.</p><p>Scheubner-Richter played a key role in shaping the Nazi Party's foreign policy, particularly with regards to Russia. He believed that Germany and Russia had a natural affinity and should work together to counter the influence of France and Britain. He also believed in the idea of a "living space" for the German people, which would require expansion into Eastern Europe and Russia.</p><p>Despite his early and enthusiastic support for Hitler and the Nazi Party, Scheubner-Richter did have disagreements with some of their policies. For example, he was critical of their anti-Semitic rhetoric and believed that Germany should focus on building alliances with other European powers rather than pursuing a policy of isolationism.</p><p>Despite his short life and relatively minor role in history, Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter's association with Hitler and the Nazi Party has made him a controversial figure. Some regard him as a courageous martyr who died for his beliefs, while others see him as a dangerous ideologue who helped lay the groundwork for the atrocities of the Third Reich.</p><p></p><p>

was
a Russian
personality.


					
			
		His child
		is
		called

						</p><p>Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich was the youngest son of Emperor Alexander III and Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia. He was a member of the Romanov dynasty, the ruling family of the Russian Empire. Despite being the younger brother of Emperor Nicholas II, Michael declined the throne after his brother's abdication in March 1917.</p><p>During World War I, Michael served in the Russian Army and was known for his courage and dedication. He was briefly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army in May 1917 but was removed from the position by the Provisional Government.</p><p>Following the Bolshevik Revolution, Michael was arrested by the Soviet authorities and imprisoned in the city of Perm. In June 1918, he was executed by a firing squad on the orders of the Bolshevik government. Michael was later canonized as a martyr by the Russian Orthodox Church.</p><p>During his youth, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich was described as a happy and carefree child. He had a love for the outdoors and enjoyed hunting and fishing. He was educated privately and spoke several languages fluently, including English, French, and German. Michael was also interested in art and music, and he took piano lessons from the renowned composer Sergei Taneyev.</p><p>In 1912, Michael married Natalia Sergeyevna Wulfert, a commoner who was widely admired for her beauty and intelligence. However, because she was not of royal blood, the marriage was considered morganatic, and their children did not have any dynastic rights. Their son George Mikhailovich pursued a career in the military and served in the British Army during World War II.</p><p>After his brother's abdication, Michael was the subject of much speculation about whether or not he would accept the throne. He was considered by some to be a more popular choice than his brother, but he ultimately declined the position, feeling that it was not his right to rule without the support of the people and the Duma.</p><p>Michael's death was a tragic loss for the Romanov family and the Russian people. In 1991, his remains were exhumed and reburied in St. Petersburg along with those of other Romanov family members who had been executed by the Bolsheviks. Today, Michael is remembered as a brave and honorable man who remained true to his convictions until the very end.</p><p></p><p>

He participated in numerous debates and discussions on the role of art in the building of socialism and the creation of a new Soviet culture.</p><p>However, Khvylovy's political views started to shift in the early 1930s, as he became disillusioned with the Stalinist regime and its policies. He criticized the widespread purges and arrests of his fellow writers and intellectuals, and he was also opposed to the forced collectivization of agriculture, which he saw as a violation of the peasants' rights. In his final years, he struggled with depression and alcoholism, which may have contributed to his suicide in 1933.</p><p>Khvylovy's legacy as a writer and a political activist has been recognized both in Ukraine and abroad. His works have been translated into many languages and are still read and studied today. He is remembered as an important representative of the Ukrainian literary avant-garde and a courageous voice against totalitarianism and oppression.</p><p></p><p>
