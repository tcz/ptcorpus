He helped launch the careers of numerous iconic musicians, including the Grateful Dead, Santana, Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin. In 1965, he founded the famous music venue, the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, which helped to popularize the counterculture movement of the 1960s. He later went on to open additional music venues in New York City and other parts of California. Graham was also known for his philanthropy, and he established the Bill Graham Foundation which supported a variety of causes, including drug abuse prevention programs and music education initiatives. Outside of his work in music and philanthropy, Graham was a Holocaust survivor and a U.S. Army veteran who served in the Korean War. Despite his success, Graham tragically died in a helicopter crash in 1991 while returning from a Huey Lewis and the News concert in Northern California. His legacy continues to live on through the music industry and his charitable endeavors.</p><p>Graham was born as Wolfgang Grajonca in Berlin, Germany in 1931 to a Jewish family. He fled Nazi Germany with his family in 1939 and settled in the Bronx in New York City. Graham's early years were marked by poverty and hardship, but he eventually found a passion for music and entertainment. He began his career as a waiter at a Catskills resort and worked his way up to become a business manager for several local rock bands.</p><p>In the 1960s, Graham emerged as a key figure in the burgeoning counterculture movement. He became known for his innovative marketing strategies and his ability to create unique and memorable concert experiences. Graham was particularly adept at bringing together diverse musical acts and creating multi-day festivals that brought thousands of fans together.</p><p>Over the course of his career, Graham produced some of the most famous concerts in rock history, including the Monterey Pop Festival, the Live Aid benefit concerts, and the famous "Summer of Love" concerts in San Francisco. He was also known for his work as a promoter for sports events and theatrical productions.</p><p>Graham was a complex and sometimes controversial figure in the music industry. He was known for his political activism and his support of various causes, but he was also known to be a tough negotiator and a shrewd businessman. Despite his sometimes rough exterior, Graham was widely respected and loved by those who knew him.</p><p>Today, Graham is remembered as one of the most important and influential figures in the history of rock and roll. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and his impact on the music industry continues to be felt to this day.</p><p>In addition to his business and philanthropic endeavors, Bill Graham was also a prolific writer and speaker. He wrote a memoir titled "Bill Graham Presents: My Life Inside Rock and Out" which was published in 1992, a year after his death. The book chronicles his life as a Holocaust survivor and his rise to fame as a music promoter. Graham was also known for his memorable speeches, including his famous address at the 1985 Live Aid concert in Philadelphia. In his speech, he urged the audience to "make a difference" and to use their collective power to help those in need. Graham's legacy continues to inspire musicians, activists, and philanthropists around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(August 2, 1931		Harlem-May 9, 1967)


was
an American
journalist and musician.


					</p><p>She is best known for being a child prodigy, who could play both piano and harp by the age of four. Her parents were Josephine Cogdell Schuyler, a white Texan author and journalist, and George Schuyler, a Black journalist, essayist, and author. </p><p>Schuyler's talent brought her to perform at prestigious events, such as the inauguration of President Harry Truman in 1949. As she grew older, she began to focus more on her writing career, traveling to Africa, Europe, and Asia as a journalist.</p><p>Despite her success and talent, Schuyler faced discrimination and struggled with her own identity. She saw herself as a bridge between races and cultures, and was often criticized for her beliefs and for challenging societal norms of the time.</p><p>Sadly, Schuyler's life was cut short when she died in a helicopter crash in Vietnam while on assignment with Newsweek magazine at the age of 35. Her legacy lives on through her music and writing, which continue to inspire and challenge readers and listeners today.</p><p>Schuyler's upbringing was highly unusual for the time period, as her parents were an interracial couple who faced significant backlash from society. This experience influenced much of her writing, which often explored issues of race, identity, and social justice. In addition to her journalism work, Schuyler also wrote novels and poetry, including the critically acclaimed memoir "Adventures in Black and White" (1960). She was a supporter of anti-colonial movements in Africa and believed in the importance of cultural exchange and understanding between different nations.</p><p>Despite facing many challenges, Schuyler remains an important figure in American history and music. Her work as a musician and journalist broke down barriers and helped to pave the way for future generations of Black artists and writers. Today, she is remembered as a trailblazer and an icon in the fight for social justice and equality.</p><p>Schuyler's impact continues to be felt in many ways, including in the scholarship established in her name. The Philippa Schuyler Memorial Scholarship was created to support exceptionally talented young musicians of all races and backgrounds in achieving their artistic dreams. Schuyler's life story has also been the subject of several biographies and documentaries, including the 2015 film "Composed", which explores Schuyler's life and lasting legacy. Overall, Schuyler's bravery, talent, and dedication to breaking down racial barriers continues to inspire and influence people in the United States and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
