(November 1, 1793		Tartu-May 19, 1831)


was
a Russian
physicist, physician and botanist.


					</p><p>He was born in Tartu, Estonia and was a descendant of German and Swedish ancestors. He studied medicine and physics at the University of Dorpat (now known as the University of Tartu) and later joined a scientific expedition to the Pacific Ocean as a naturalist and physician. During this voyage, which lasted from 1815 to 1818, he made significant contributions to the field of marine biology and discovered several new species of marine life.</p><p>Eschscholtz was also an accomplished botanist, interested in the flora of the Hawaiian Islands, where he made important contributions to the field of phycology or the study of algae. He collected and documented over 500 species of plants and animals during his travels and his specimens can be found in museums around the world.</p><p>In addition to his scientific pursuits, Eschscholtz was noted for his bravery during the voyage. When the ship he was on was attacked by pirates, he defended the ship's crew, even though he was outnumbered and unarmed. He later received recognition for his valor and was awarded the Cross of St. Vladimir, a Russian military honor.</p><p>Eschscholtz died at the age of 37, having contracted a tropical disease during the Pacific expedition. Despite his short life, he made significant contributions to the field of natural history and his work continues to be studied and admired by scientists today.</p><p>Eschscholtz's legacy also includes the discovery and classification of the Eschscholtz Sound, a body of water between the Alaskan mainland and the Sanak Islands.Weakness and fatigue forced Eschscholtz to abandon his work in 1825 and he returned to St. Petersburg, where he was appointed doctor to the Russian Imperial Court. Nonetheless, he continued to serve as a professor at the University of Dorpat and published several notable scientific papers. In recognition of his achievements, the crater Eschscholtz on the Moon was named after him.A monument to Eschscholtz was erected in his hometown of Tartu in 1938.</p><p>Eschscholtz's scientific work was highly respected during his time and he received several honors for his contributions. In addition to the Cross of St. Vladimir, he was awarded the Demidov Prize, a prestigious award for scientific achievements. He was also a member of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Eschscholtz had a close working relationship with the German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster and they shared a deep interest in marine biology. In fact, Eschscholtz was responsible for publishing Forster's posthumous botanical work.</p><p>Eschscholtz was known for his meticulous attention to detail and his ability to make accurate observations. He was also an excellent artist and drew detailed illustrations of many of the plants and animals he discovered during his travels. Eschscholtz's contributions to the fields of phycology and marine biology were significant and his work influenced many future scientists.</p><p>Eschscholtz's legacy also includes his impact on the study of Hawaiian flora and fauna. He collected and documented many species that were not previously known to science and his work helped lay the foundation for further study of the unique biodiversity of the Hawaiian Islands. Today, several species of plants and animals are named after him, including the Eschscholzia californica, a species of poppy.</p><p></p><p>

						</p><p>Pushkin is considered one of the greatest writers in the Russian language and is often referred to as the "founder of modern Russian literature." He is best known for his novel in verse, "Eugene Onegin," which tells the story of a wealthy and idle young man who rejects the love of a young woman, only to regret it later in life.</p><p>In addition to his literary works, Pushkin was also involved in politics and opposition to the Tsarist government. He was exiled to the south of Russia for his political views and was under surveillance for the rest of his life.</p><p>Pushkin's legacy has had a profound impact on Russian literature and culture, and he is widely celebrated in the country as a national hero. Many institutions, including the Pushkin Museum in Moscow and the Pushkin State Institute of Russian Language in Saint Petersburg, are dedicated to him and his work.</p><p>Pushkin started writing poetry and prose at a young age and published his first poem at the age of 15. He was educated in Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, which was known for its rigorous educational program and produced many notable graduates. Pushkin's writing was influential in shaping the Russian literary language and many of his expressions and phrases have become common idioms. </p><p>Pushkin's personal life was tumultuous and he had many affairs, including one with a married woman that resulted in a fatal duel with her husband.

(November 17, 1896		Orsha-June 11, 1934			Moscow)

	
		also known as Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky or L. Vygotskiĭ

	
was
a Russian
scientist and psychologist.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Gita Vygodskaya and Asya Vigodskaya.

						</p><p>Vygotsky's work centered around the theory of social development, which emphasizes the role of social interaction in the development of cognitive processes. He believed that children learn best when engaged in social activities with adults or peers, and that language plays a crucial role in this process. Vygotsky's research also explored the connections between thought, language, and culture, and he contributed significantly to the development of the field of cultural-historical psychology. His ideas have had a significant impact on the fields of education and psychology, and his works continue to be widely studied and cited today.</p><p>Despite only living to the age of 37, Lev Vygotsky's contributions to the field of psychology were groundbreaking. He was born in Western Russia to a middle-class Jewish family and grew up during a time of great political and cultural change in Russia. Vygotsky received his education in law at Moscow State University but developed an interest in psychology and soon pursued it as a full-time career.</p><p>In addition to his work on social development, Vygotsky also developed the concept of the "zone of proximal development," which refers to the level of difficulty of tasks that a child can accomplish with guidance and support from a more knowledgeable person. This idea has been influential in the design of educational curriculums and instructional methods.</p><p>Vygotsky's work was not fully appreciated during his lifetime, as his ideas were suppressed under Stalin's regime. However, after his death, his work was rediscovered and gained widespread recognition in the West during the 1970s and 80s. Today, Vygotsky is considered one of the most important psychologists of the 20th century, and his work has influenced a wide range of fields, including education, developmental psychology, linguistics, and cultural studies.</p><p>In addition to his groundbreaking work on social development and the zone of proximal development, Lev Vygotsky also conducted extensive research on the role of play in child development. He believed that play was a critical mechanism for cognitive and social development and that children use play to explore and make sense of the world around them. Vygotsky's theories on play have influenced the development of children's toys, games, and educational materials. </p><p>Vygotsky was also an advocate for inclusive education, which emphasized the need to provide education and support to all children, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds. He believed that every child had the potential for learning and development, and that it was the role of educators to create a supportive environment that enabled all children to reach their full potential. </p><p>In addition to his research and advocacy work, Vygotsky was also a prolific writer and published numerous papers and books on topics ranging from child development to cultural psychology. His most famous works include "Thought and Language," "Mind in Society," and "The Development of Higher Psychological Processes." Today, his ideas continue to shape the way psychologists and educators think about child development, learning, and social interaction.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of tuberculosis.
