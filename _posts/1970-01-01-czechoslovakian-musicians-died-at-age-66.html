(December 24, 1882		Brno-March 31, 1949			Prague)


was
a Czechoslovakian
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work in the field of book design and illustration. Obrovský studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague and later worked as a teacher at the State School of Graphic Arts. He collaborated with several publishers and produced numerous illustrations and book designs for classic Czech literature. Among his notable works are illustrations for Karel Čapek's "The War with the Newts" and "The Makropulos Affair" by Leoš Janáček. After the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, he was persecuted for his political views and prohibited from exhibiting his work. Obrovský died in 1949 in Prague at the age of 66. His legacy as an artist and book designer continues to influence the world of Czech illustration to this day.</p><p>In addition to his work in book design and illustration, Jakub Obrovský also worked on numerous murals and mosaics for public buildings. He was a member of the Mánes Union of Fine Arts, which was a group of artists that focused on modern art movements such as Cubism and Surrealism. Obrovský's style evolved over the years, with his early work being more traditional and realistic, and later works showing a more abstract and geometric influence. His illustrations for "The War with the Newts" have been praised for their satirical take on political and social issues of the time. Despite the political obstacles he faced during his lifetime, Obrovský's art has been recognized as an important contribution to Czech culture and history. Today, his work can be found in several museums and public collections throughout the Czech Republic.</p><p>Additionally, Jakub Obrovský was a member of the Czechoslovakian resistance against the Nazi regime during World War II. He was involved in printing and distributing anti-Nazi propaganda and was eventually imprisoned by the Gestapo. Obrovský's time in prison had a significant impact on both his health and artistic output, as he suffered from poor health for the rest of his life and produced fewer works of art. Despite these challenges, Obrovský continued to create art and advocate for political freedom in Czechoslovakia. His dedication to his craft and his country continue to inspire artists and activists today. Obrovský's former home in Prague is now a museum dedicated to his life and work.</p><p></p><p>

(April 28, 1908		Svitavy-October 9, 1974			Hildesheim)


was
a Czechoslovakian
industrialist and businessperson.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Emily Schlegel and Oskar Jr Schlegel.

						</p><p>During the Holocaust, Schindler saved the lives of over 1,200 Jewish workers by employing them in his factories, which were designated as essential to the war effort by the Nazi regime. Schindler spent his entire fortune protecting the lives of these workers and went bankrupt in the process.</p><p>Schindler's story was popularized in Steven Spielberg's Academy Award-winning film "Schindler's List," which was based on the book "Schindler's Ark" by Australian author Thomas Keneally. Schindler's actions have been recognized and memorialized by numerous organizations and governments, including Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Israel, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Schindler was born into a German family but was raised in a largely Czech-speaking community in Moravia. After completing his education, he worked in several jobs before joining the Nazi Party in 1939. Initially, he saw the party as an opportunity to advance his business interests, but he later developed a strong sense of shame for his involvement.</p><p>Schindler initially started his business dealings with the Nazis by supplying them with enamelware; however, in 1943, he acquired an enamelware factory in Krakow, Poland, which he rebranded as an armaments factory. This factory became a sanctuary for Jewish workers who would otherwise have been sent to concentration camps, and Schindler utilized his connections and wealth to protect them from persecution.</p><p>After the war, Schindler emigrated to Argentina, where he ran a farm but was largely unsuccessful. He later moved to Germany where he lived out the rest of his life in relative obscurity. In 1963, Schindler was recognized as a Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem for his heroism in saving the lives of Jewish workers during the Holocaust. His grave site in Jerusalem is one of the most visited in Israel.</p><p>Despite being recognized as a hero and savior of Jewish lives, Schindler struggled with alcoholism and financial issues throughout his life. He was often supported by the Jewish survivors he rescued, who helped him financially when he was in need. Schindler's wife, Emilie Schindler, was also instrumental in the rescue efforts, and she continued to visit and support the survivors long after the war ended. Schindler's factory in Krakow is now a museum dedicated to his legacy and the memory of the Holocaust. The story of Schindler's actions continues to inspire people around the world to take a stand against injustice and oppression.</p><p></p><p>
