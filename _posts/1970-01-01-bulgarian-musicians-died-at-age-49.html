(March 1, 1929		Vitosha, Sofia-September 11, 1978			London)


was
a Bulgarian
writer and journalist.


					</p><p>Markov gained international recognition for his work as a dissident writer and journalist critical of the communist regime in Bulgaria. He worked for the Bulgarian state press agency in the 1960s but was dismissed for his subversive writing. Markov subsequently fled to the West in 1969 and worked for the BBC, Radio Free Europe, and other Western media outlets. </p><p>On September 7th, 1978, while waiting for a bus in London, Markov felt a sharp pain in his right thigh. He turned around and saw a man picking up an umbrella from the ground. He later discovered that this umbrella had been modified with a tiny pellet filled with ricin, a highly toxic poison. Markov died four days later, after suffering from a high fever, chills, and organ failure.</p><p>Markovâ€™s assassination has been attributed to Bulgarian intelligence agents, who were suspected of targeting him due to his outspoken criticism of Bulgaria's communist government. Although no one has been officially charged with his assassination, the case remains open and the investigation continues to this day.</p><p>Markov was a prolific writer and poet, and his works were widely published in Bulgaria before he turned to dissident journalism. He wrote several novels, plays, and essays that were critical of the Bulgarian communist regime and its policies. His most famous works include the novel "The Roof", the play "The Island", and the essay "The Ritual". Markov was also known for his sharp wit and sense of humor, which he used to satirize the government and its officials.</p><p>After his assassination, Markov became a symbol of resistance against communist oppression and censorship. He inspired many other dissident writers and journalists in Bulgaria and across Eastern Europe to stand up against oppressive regimes and fight for the freedom of expression. His legacy continues to inspire people today, and he is remembered as a courageous and brilliant writer who sacrificed his life for the ideals of democracy and human rights.</p><p>Markov's assassination by the Bulgarian secret service led to international outrage and condemnation. Following his death, many Western countries imposed diplomatic sanctions against Bulgaria, and his assassination was widely covered by the media. The incident also led to increased scrutiny of the activities of Eastern European intelligence agencies in the West.</p><p>In 2019, on the 41st anniversary of Markov's death, a plaque was unveiled in London to honor his life and legacy. The plaque is located near the spot where he was attacked and is inscribed with a quote from one of his essays: "Believe in yourselves, in the power of truth and of liberated thinking." The plaque serves as a reminder of Markov's contribution to the fight for freedom of expression and provides a tangible symbol of his enduring legacy.</p><p>Today, Markov's works continue to be read and admired by many in Bulgaria and around the world. His writings provide an insight into the challenges faced by dissident writers and journalists during the communist era and serve as a reminder of the importance of freedom of speech and the struggle for democracy.</p><p>Markov's assassination had a significant impact on the field of espionage and the development of new spy technology. The modified umbrella used to inject the ricin pellet into his leg became known as the "Bulgarian umbrella" and was later identified as a KGB invention. The incident also led to increased awareness of the potential of toxic substances as assassination tools, and the development of countermeasures to protect against them. Markov's death is considered one of the most high-profile cases of political assassination during the Cold War era. Despite the passage of time, Markov's legacy as a writer and a symbol of resistance against totalitarianism continues to inspire people around the world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in poisoning.
