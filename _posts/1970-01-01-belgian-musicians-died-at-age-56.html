In addition to his sculpting, he also worked as a painter and illustrator for newspapers and magazines. His work continues to inspire and influence artists around the world.</p><p>Lambeaux's life was not without controversy.

Nonetheless, his work was eventually accepted, and the sculpture became a showpiece of the exhibition, drawing in thousands of viewers. </p><p>Lambeaux also had a tumultuous personal life. He married twice, both times to women much younger than himself. His first marriage was to a fellow artist, and they had two children together before separating. His second marriage was to his mistress, whom he had met while still married to his first wife. The scandal of the affair overshadowed his artistic accomplishments for a time, but he later reconciled with his first wife and remained with her until his death. </p><p>Despite the controversies in his life, Lambeaux's talent and skill as an artist were widely acknowledged during his lifetime. Today, his work can be found in museums and public spaces around the world, including in the United States, Canada, and Japan.</p><p></p><p>
