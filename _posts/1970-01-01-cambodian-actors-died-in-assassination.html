							He is best known for his Academy Award-winning performance as Dith Pran in the 1984 film, "The Killing Fields." Ngor had a tragic life storyâ€”he survived the trauma of the Khmer Rouge regime, which claimed the lives of his wife and unborn child, and he was also imprisoned in a labor camp. He eventually fled to Thailand, where he lived as a refugee before moving to the United States in 1980. In addition to his acting career, Ngor was an outspoken activist for human rights and brought attention to the atrocities committed during the Cambodian genocide. He wrote a memoir, "Haing Ngor: A Cambodian Odyssey," which chronicles his experiences and serves as a testament to his strength and perseverance. Unfortunately, in 1996, just weeks after completing filming on the movie "My Life in the Garden," Ngor was tragically murdered outside his Los Angeles apartment in a botched robbery.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=420922" title="Wikipedia article about Haing S.
