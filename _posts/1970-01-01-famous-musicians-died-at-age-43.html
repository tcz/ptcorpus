(October 1, 1340		Deventer-August 20, 1384)


was
a Dutch
personality.


					</p><p>Groote was a prominent figure in the Devotio Moderna movement, which emphasized spiritual devotion and personal reform within the Catholic Church. He founded the Brethren of the Common Life, a community of laypeople who dedicated themselves to simplicity, self-denial, and helping others. Groote also played a key role in the establishment of the Modern Devotion, a religious movement that focused on inner reflection and individual piety. His ideas influenced many notable figures, including Thomas a Kempis, who wrote the devotional classic "The Imitation of Christ".</p><p>Groote was born into a wealthy family, but he gave up his inheritance and devoted his life to spiritual pursuits. He studied theology and was ordained a priest, but he became disillusioned with the corruption he saw in the church. He began preaching a message of reform and calling for a return to the simplicity and humility of the early Christian church.</p><p>Groote's emphasis on personal piety and practical Christian living had a profound impact on the church and society of his time. His writings and teachings influenced the Protestant Reformation that followed a century later. Even today, his ideas continue to shape Christian spirituality and inspire those seeking a deeper relationship with God.</p><p>During his lifetime, Geert Groote also played a major role in founding the Windesheim Congregation, a community of Augustinian canons regular who helped spread the Modern Devotion throughout the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium. Groote's commitment to education also led him to establish several schools, including a school for the poor that received support from prominent figures such as Thomas of Kempen and the archbishop of Utrecht. Groote's influence extended beyond religious circles as well; his teachings also inspired the founding of Renaissance humanism in the Netherlands. Today, many schools and religious orders around the world still follow the principles of Groote and the Devotio Moderna.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by bubonic plague.

(April 1, 1854		Ralls County-July 9, 1897			Chicago)


was
an American
personality.


					</p><p>He was the first Catholic priest in the United States publicly known to be black. Born into slavery, he escaped with his mother and siblings during the American Civil War to Quincy, Illinois. Despite facing discrimination and resistance within the Catholic Church, Tolton persevered and studied to become a priest in Rome, where race was not an obstacle to ordination. He returned to the United States and served as a priest in several cities, including Quincy, Chicago, and Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), before passing away at the young age of 43. Tolton's life and legacy continue to inspire those who seek justice and equality for all regardless of race or background.</p><p>Tolton's dedication to the church and his community was evident in his service as a priest. He established St. Monica's Catholic Church in Chicago, which was the first black Catholic church in the city. Despite facing significant opposition and discrimination, he continued to work towards equality and integration within the church.</p><p>Tolton's legacy has been recognized in various ways. In 2010, the Vatican began the process officially to consider Tolton for sainthood. Additionally, in 2019, Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago announced that a new Catholic school in Chicago would be named after Tolton, further cementing his place in American history.</p><p>Tolton faced hardship and discrimination throughout his life due to his race. When he entered seminary, he was denied acceptance by every American seminary because of his skin color. Ultimately, he was accepted at the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome, where he was ordained in 1886. </p><p>Upon his return to the United States, Tolton faced further resistance from the church hierarchy, who often assigned him to missions with impoverished and marginalized communities. Nevertheless, he continued to serve with distinction, helping to establish numerous churches and serving as a mentor to other black Catholic priests. He also spoke out against racism and discrimination, calling for greater unity and understanding between different races and ethnicities.</p><p>Today, Augustus Tolton is honored as a pioneer and trailblazer, both for his contributions to the church and for his unwavering commitment to justice and equality. He remains an inspiration to many, and his legacy continues to influence the ongoing struggles for civil rights and social justice in the United States.</p><p></p><p>

(August 13, 1894		St. Louis-January 11, 1938)


was
an American
personality.


					</p><p>Ed Musick was a highly accomplished pilot and aviation pioneer. He began his career as a barnstormer in the 1920s and later worked for Pan American Airways as a pilot. Musick is best known for his contributions to transpacific airline routes, having been the pilot of the first flights to cross the Pacific Ocean. Musick's dedication to aviation ultimately led to his untimely death in a flying boat crash in 1938. He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his contributions to the aviation industry.</p><p>Musick was initially interested in mechanical engineering, but he decided to pursue a career in aviation after serving in the US Army during World War I. In the 1920s, he performed as a barnstormer alongside other pilots, wowing crowds with their daring aerial maneuvers. Musick later joined Pan American Airways, where he played a crucial role in the expansion of commercial air travel across the Pacific. He piloted numerous flights from San Francisco to Manila, earning him the nickname "Captain Musick of the Pacific".</p><p>Musick's contributions to the aviation industry were not limited to his transpacific flights. He also worked on the development of a new instrument, the radio compass, which allowed for safer navigation and communication during flights. Additionally, Musick was a passionate advocate for improvements in airplane design and safety measures.</p><p>Tragically, Musick's life was cut short when the flying boat he was piloting, the Pan Am Hawaii Clipper, crashed during a routine mail delivery flight from Guam to Manila. All nine people on board perished. The cause of the crash was never definitively determined, though some theorize that a mechanical failure or sabotage may have been to blame. </p><p>Despite his early death, Musick's legacy lives on in the many advancements he made to the aviation industry. His passion for exploration and innovation paved the way for the development of transpacific air travel and inspired future generations of pilots and engineers.</p><p>Following his death, Ed Musick was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his contributions to aviation.

In addition to the Distinguished Flying Cross, Musick was also recognized with several other awards during his career, including the Harmon Trophy and the Daniel Guggenheim Medal for his work on the radio compass. </p><p>Musick's legacy has continued to inspire those in the aviation industry, and his pioneering contributions to the field have not been forgotten. In 2014, the Honolulu Community College initiated the Ed Musick Agreements, which aim to promote collaboration between the US and China in the aviation industry. The agreements were named after Musick to pay tribute to his role in opening up transpacific travel. Ed Musick's adventurous spirit, determination, and love of aviation will always be remembered as important contributions to the history of flight.</p><p></p><p>

(January 4, 1809		Coupvray-January 6, 1852			Paris)


was
a French
inventor.


					</p><p>Braille is most well-known for inventing the Braille code, a reading and writing system for the visually impaired. He was inspired to invent the system after finding a code in the French military that allowed soldiers to communicate silently in the dark. Braille's system uses raised dots on a page that can be felt by the fingertips. He worked tirelessly to develop and refine the code, and continued to promote its use even while battling his own health issues. Today, the Braille code is used worldwide, and Braille is remembered as a pioneer in the field of accessibility for people with visual impairments.</p><p>Louis Braille was born in Coupvray, France. At the age of three, he accidentally blinded himself in one eye while playing in his father's workshop. An infection soon spread to his other eye, and by the age of five, he was completely blind. Nevertheless, he was an excellent student and received a scholarship to attend the National Institute for Blind Youth in Paris when he was ten years old.</p><p>Braille initially used a writing system he had developed using embossed paper, but it was difficult to read and write. He learned about a system of raised dots and dashes called "night writing" developed by Charles Barbier de la Serre, a French army captain, which allowed soldiers to communicate silently in the dark. Braille was inspired by the concept and adapted it into what is now known as the Braille code.</p><p>Braille continued to refine his system and published a book about it, titled "Method of Writing Words, Music, and Plain Songs by Means of Dots, for Use by the Blind and Arranged for Them." The book was well-received, and the Braille code quickly gained popularity in France and other countries.</p><p>Despite being diagnosed with tuberculosis, Braille continued to work on improving the Braille code until his death at the age of 43. His legacy lives on, and the Braille code is used by millions of blind individuals worldwide. Additionally, the Louis Braille Museum in Coupvray, France, is dedicated to his life and work.</p><p>Braille's invention of the Braille code revolutionized educational opportunities for blind individuals. Before the Braille code, literacy rates among the blind were extremely low, as the only alternative was to learn to read and write using embossed letters, which was tedious and time-consuming. Thanks to the Braille code, blind individuals can read and write just as efficiently as sighted individuals. </p><p>Braille was also an accomplished musician and played the organ, cello, and violin. He even invented a method for reading music using the Braille code, allowing blind individuals to read and play music just like sighted individuals. </p><p>Today, Braille code remains an essential tool for accessibility in various settings, including public transportation, public buildings, and educational institutions. Thanks to Braille's groundbreaking invention, the lives of millions of visually impaired individuals have been made more accessible and inclusive.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of tuberculosis.
