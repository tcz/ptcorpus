						Jani Christou was born to Greek parents in Heliopolis, Egypt in 1926. He spent his childhood in Alexandria before moving to Athens to study music. He was interested in art and philosophy from a young age, and these interests would later shape his music. </p><p>Christou adopted serialism early on in his career and became associated with the modernist movement in Greece. He was also drawn to the avant-garde and experimented with unconventional methods of composition. His work often featured non-musical elements, such as spoken word, theater, and performance art. </p><p>In addition to his music, Christou was also a prominent teacher and lecturer. He taught composition at the Athens Conservatory and his ideas on music and art were influential in the Greek art scene. </p><p>Unfortunately, Christou's life was cut short when he died in a car accident in Athens in 1970, just one day before his 44th birthday. Despite his relatively short career, he left behind a legacy of innovative and challenging music that continues to be celebrated today.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=3646234" title="Wikipedia article about Jani Christou">Jani Christou on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/danish-musicians-died-in-jaundice.html' title='Danish musicians died in Jaundice'><strong>Danish musicians died in Jaundice</strong> List of the top 1 Danish music stars who died in Jaundice</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-myocardial-infarction.html' title='Famous musicians died in Myocardial infarction'><strong>Famous musicians died in Myocardial infarction</strong> List of the top 50 Famous music stars who died in Myocardial infarction</a></li><li><a href='/swedish-actors-died-in-1999.html' title='Swedish actors died in 1999'><strong>Swedish actors died in 1999</strong> List of the top 4 Swedish actors who died in 1999</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/estonian-musicians-died-at-age-73.html' title='Estonian musicians died at age 73'><strong>Estonian musicians died at age 73</strong> List of the top 1 Estonian music stars who died when they were 73</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-chest-injury.html' title='Famous musicians died in Chest injury'><strong>Famous musicians died in Chest injury</strong> List of the top 1 Famous music stars who died in Chest injury</a></li><li><a href='/chilean-musicians-died-at-age-27.html' title='Chilean musicians died at age 27'><strong>Chilean musicians died at age 27</strong> List of the top 1 Chilean music stars who died when they were 27</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
