							Boon was born in Aalst, a small town in the Flemish region of Belgium. He grew up in poverty and left school at the age of 16 to work as a blacksmith apprentice. Despite his lack of formal education, Boon began writing at a young age and became one of the most prolific and influential writers of Flemish literature. He wrote dozens of books, including novels, short stories, and essays, many of which were controversial for their explicit sexual content and social criticism.</p><p>Boon's most famous novel is "De Kapellekensbaan" (The Chapel Road), which was published in 1953. The book is a sprawling, poetic epic about life in a fictional Flemish town and is considered one of the most important works of Flemish literature of the 20th century. Other notable works by Boon include "Mijn Kleine Oorlog" (My Little War), which is a semi-autobiographical account of his experiences during World War II, and "Dagboek 1964-1969" (Diary 1964-1969), which is a collection of his personal notes and observations.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Boon was also a celebrated actor and appeared in several films and television shows. He was known for his outspoken leftist views and his commitment to social justice. Boon died in 1979 at the age of 67, but his legacy as a pioneering writer and activist continues to inspire generations of Flemish and Belgian artists.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=381846" title="Wikipedia article about Louis Paul Boon">Louis Paul Boon on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/israeli-actors-died-at-age-58.html' title='Israeli actors died at age 58'><strong>Israeli actors died at age 58</strong> List of the top 1 Israeli actors who died when they were 58</a></li><li><a href='/brazilian-musicians-died-in-cancer.html' title='Brazilian musicians died in Cancer'><strong>Brazilian musicians died in Cancer</strong> List of the top 3 Brazilian music stars who died in Cancer</a></li><li><a href='/new-zealand-actors-died-at-age-55.html' title='New Zealand actors died at age 55'><strong>New Zealand actors died at age 55</strong> List of the top 1 New Zealand actors who died when they were 55</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/hungarian-actors-died-at-age-77.html' title='Hungarian actors died at age 77'><strong>Hungarian actors died at age 77</strong> List of the top 2 Hungarian actors who died when they were 77</a></li><li><a href='/dutch-actresses-died-in-1979.html' title='Dutch actresses died in 1979'><strong>Dutch actresses died in 1979</strong> List of the top 2 Dutch actresses who died in 1979</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-pyelonephritis.html' title='Famous actors died in Pyelonephritis'><strong>Famous actors died in Pyelonephritis</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actors who died in Pyelonephritis</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
