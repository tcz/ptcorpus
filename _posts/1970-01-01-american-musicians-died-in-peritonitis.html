actor, dancer, teacher and film producer.


					</p><p>He was born in Italy and immigrated to the United States in 1913. Valentino began his career as a dancer in New York City and later transitioned to acting in silent films. He quickly became known for his good looks and suave demeanor, earning him the nickname "The Latin Lover." </p><p>Valentino appeared in several successful films, including The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and The Sheik, both of which helped to solidify his status as a Hollywood heartthrob. Despite his success, Valentino was often criticized for his acting ability and was determined to prove his detractors wrong by taking on more challenging roles. </p><p>Tragically, Valentino's life was cut short when he died at the age of 31 from complications from appendicitis. His death sent shockwaves through the world and led to mass hysteria among his fans, with some even committing suicide in grief. Despite his brief life, Valentino's impact on Hollywood and popular culture has endured, and he remains an iconic figure to this day.</p><p>Valentino was also known for his off-screen romances and whirlwind marriages, including his highly-publicized marriage to actress Jean Acker, which lasted only a few hours before Acker locked him out of their honeymoon suite. He later married actress Natacha Rambova, who became his longtime creative partner and helped to shape his image and style. Valentino was frequently at odds with studio executives and was one of the first actors to demand greater control over his career, eventually forming his own production company in an effort to gain more creative autonomy. He was also one of the first actors to establish a strong fan base, with thousands of adoring fans lining up to see him at public appearances and events. Today, Valentino's legacy can be seen in the numerous films and biopics that have been made about his life and career, as well as the enduring fascination with his enigmatic persona and early death.</p><p>Valentino was also known for his flamboyant style and love of fashion, which helped to cement his status as a sex symbol and cultural icon. He often sported daring, androgynous looks, such as frilly shirts, silk robes, and bold accessories, that challenged traditional notions of masculinity. His fashion sense was influenced by his Italian heritage and his appreciation for the art and aesthetics of the Old World. Valentino also had a keen interest in the occult and mysticism, which he shared with Rambova, and which led to rumors of him being involved in secret societies and cults. Despite the controversies and scandals that surrounded him, Valentino's talent and charisma continue to inspire generations of actors and performers, and his legacy remains a testament to the enduring power of Hollywood and celebrity culture.</p><p></p><p>

Houdini was known for his dedication to his craft and would often spend weeks or even months practicing his acts before performing them on stage.</p><p>In addition to his performances, Houdini was also known for his public stunts and challenges. He offered rewards to anyone who could successfully restrain him, and even invited police forces to try their best to keep him locked up. He also performed a famous stunt in which he allowed himself to be buried alive, which became a sensation and was later recreated by other performers.</p><p>Despite his fame and success, Houdini was also known for his generosity and philanthropy.

In 1926, while performing in Montreal, Houdini was punched in the stomach by a student who wanted to test the magician's abilities to withstand punches. Houdini was later diagnosed with appendicitis and died a few days later from complications of the illness. There were rumors that Houdini died from being poisoned, but these theories were later debunked. Despite his death, Houdini's legacy continues to be celebrated and studied by magicians and performers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
