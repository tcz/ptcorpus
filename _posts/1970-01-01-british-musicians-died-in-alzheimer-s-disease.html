						</p><p>Lillie began her career in London's West End and later moved to Broadway in New York City. She was known for her witty humor and unique style of delivery, as well as her ability to transition seamlessly between comedic and dramatic roles. Some of her notable performances include "This Year of Grace" and "Aren't We All?" on Broadway, as well as "On Approval" and "Charlot's Revue" in London.

She began her career as a performer in the early 1910s, and quickly gained popularity for her distinctive comedic style. Lillie was known for her ability to create eccentric and hilariously self-absorbed characters, often mocking the upper class and those in positions of power.</p><p>In addition to her work on stage and screen, Lillie was also a talented singer and songwriter. She wrote several hit songs, including "There Are Fairies at the Bottom of Our Garden" and "One Hour with You". Lillie's wit and charm made her a beloved figure in the entertainment world, and she continued to perform well into her later years.</p><p>Despite her success as a performer, Lillie had a tumultuous personal life. She was married and divorced twice, and also had a long-term relationship with the actor and director Sir Charles Spencer "Charlie" Chaplin. Lillie died in Henley-on-Thames, England in 1989 at the age of 94.</p><p>Lillie's unconventional and daring approach to comedy made her a pioneer in the genre of musical comedy. She was a key player in the 1920s and 1930s theater scene in London and New York, where she performed alongside the likes of Noel Coward and Gertrude Lawrence. Her stage presence was unforgettable, with her trademark blonde wig and dramatic facial expressions. Her influence on other comedians, both male and female, cannot be overstated.</p><p>Apart from her work in theater and film, Lillie was an active philanthropist, and co-founded the annual charity fundraiser "The Pageant of Labour" in London. She was also known for her sharp wit and humor in her personal life, often entertaining family and friends with her anecdotes and quips.</p><p>In recognition of her contributions to the arts, Lillie was awarded the Drama Desk Award in 1958 and 1968, the Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1985, and was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1981. Her legacy continues to inspire performers and comedians to this day.</p><p></p><p>
