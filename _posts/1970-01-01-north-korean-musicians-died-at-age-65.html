						</p><p>Song Hye-rim was born in what is now South Korea and later moved to North Korea where she became a prominent actress in North Korean cinema in the 1950s and 1960s. She was known for her beauty and talent, and was a favorite of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, with whom she had a rumored romantic relationship. </p><p>In 1967, Song Hye-rim gave birth to a son, Kim Jong-nam, whose father's identity has never been confirmed. After Kim Jong-nam's birth, Song Hye-rim retired from acting and lived in seclusion, reportedly due to political rivalries within the North Korean government. </p><p>In 1982, she accompanied Kim Jong-il on a trip to Vienna, where she fell ill and remained hospitalized for some time. After her recovery, she chose not to return to North Korea and instead lived in Moscow until her death in 2002. Kim Jong-nam, her son, was assassinated in Malaysia in 2017.</p><p>Song Hye-rim's career in North Korean cinema spanned over a decade, during which she starred in several films including "Sea of Blood" and "Flower Girl". She was awarded the title of "People's Actress" in 1969 in recognition of her contributions to North Korean cinema. Song Hye-rim's rumored relationship with Kim Jong-il was a subject of much speculation, and some reports even suggest that he may have divorced his first wife to be with her. Despite the rumors, there is little concrete evidence to support these claims. After Song Hye-rim's death, her body was reportedly cremated in Moscow and her ashes were returned to North Korea. Her legacy as a talented and beautiful actress continues to be celebrated in North Korean culture.</p><p></p><p>
