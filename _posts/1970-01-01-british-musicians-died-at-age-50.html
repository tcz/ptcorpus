(December 17, 1778		Penzance-May 29, 1829			Geneva)

	
		also known as Humphrey Davy or Sir Humphrey Davy

	
was
a British
scientist and chemist.


					</p><p>Davy was born in Cornwall, England and showed an early interest in science. At the age of 19, he became an apprentice to a surgeon and apothecary in Penzance. He later moved to Bristol where he began to study chemistry and conducted his first scientific experiments. </p><p>In his later years, Davy made many important contributions to the field of chemistry. He discovered several new elements, including sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and barium. He also invented the Davy lamp, a safety lamp for miners that greatly reduced the risk of explosions caused by flammable gases.</p><p>Davy was a fellow of the Royal Society and was knighted in 1812 for his contributions to science. He also served as president of the Royal Society from 1820 until his death in 1829.</p><p>Davy's work in electrochemistry was also significant. He conducted experiments on the electrical and chemical properties of substances, and discovered the process of electrolysis, which led to the development of electroplating and the electrochemical cell. Additionally, his research on nitrous oxide, popularly known as laughing gas, showed potential in its use as an anesthetic during surgery.</p><p>Aside from his contributions to science, Davy was also a talented lecturer and writer. He published multiple scientific papers and books, and his public lectures were popular among both scholars and the general public. He was a member of the literary and philosophical societies of Manchester and Newcastle, as well as the Royal Irish Academy.</p><p>Despite his success, Davy struggled with addiction to nitrous oxide and opium. He also had several well-known conflicts with other scientists, including his bitter rivalry with Michael Faraday.</p><p>In his final years, Davy traveled extensively throughout Europe, visiting France, Italy, and Switzerland. He passed away in Geneva in 1829 at the age of 50. His legacy as a pioneering chemist and inventor lives on today through various scientific discoveries and technologies that continue to impact the world.</p><p>Davy's contribution to science was not limited to chemistry alone, as he also made significant contributions to the field of geology. He conducted several geological surveys across England and Europe, including an exploration of the volcanoes of Naples. His research led him to propose the theory that the Earth's crust was made up of multiple layers of rock, an idea that was later supported by other scientists.</p><p>Davy was known for his innovative and experimental approach to science, often pushing the boundaries of what was considered possible at the time. One example of this was his attempt to create artificial diamonds through a process of intense heat and pressure. Although he was unsuccessful in his attempt, his experiments helped pave the way for future research into the nature of diamonds.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Davy was also a controversial figure in his time. His reputation was often marred by accusations of plagiarism and dishonesty, and he was criticized for his involvement in commercial enterprises related to his scientific work. Nevertheless, his legacy as a pioneer of modern chemistry and inventor of ground-breaking technologies continues to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>In addition to his scientific contributions, Davy was also a socialite and had many notable friends in the intellectual circles of his time. He was close friends with the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey, and even spent time living with Coleridge and his family. He was also a member of the exclusive Royal Society Club, which included esteemed members such as Benjamin Franklin and Joseph Banks.</p><p>Davy's influence extended beyond his lifetime, with scientific institutions like the Royal Institution of Great Britain and the Davy Medal being named in honor of his contributions to science. His papers and manuscripts are still studied by scientists and historians today, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of scientists and inventors.</p><p></p><p>
