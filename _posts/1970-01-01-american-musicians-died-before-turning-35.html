(May 21, 1960		West Allis-November 28, 1994			Portage)

	
		also known as Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer

	
was
an American
criminal.


					</p><p>Dahmer became notorious for committing the rape, murder, and dismemberment of 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. He often cannibalized parts of his victims and kept body parts as souvenirs. He was finally caught in 1991 after one of his intended victims managed to escape and alert the police. Dahmer pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to 15 life terms in prison. While in prison, he was beaten to death by a fellow inmate in 1994. Dahmer's case remains one of the most infamous in American criminal history.</p><p>Dahmer had a troubled childhood, and struggled with alcoholism and feelings of isolation throughout his life. He dropped out of Ohio State University after just one semester due to poor grades, and soon after, he began committing his first murders. After his arrest, Dahmer underwent a series of psychiatric evaluations and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and necrophilia. He attempted to seek help and even expressed remorse for his actions, but ultimately, his sentence was carried out. His case sparked a national conversation about mental illness and the criminal justice system. Today, Dahmer's crimes continue to fascinate and horrify people around the world.</p><p>Attempts were made to understand the mind of such a heinous killer. Authorities confirmed that Dahmer was also greatly affected by his parent's divorce when he was just 18 years old. Before the killings began, Dahmer would often pick up random hitchhikers for fleeting sexual encounters, which later escalated to murder. Following his capture, a search of his apartment revealed several horrific objects, including human remains that he had kept, decomposing body parts, a human head in the refrigerator, and several photographs of his victims. Dahmer's victims were mostly below the age of 30 and included a mix of racial backgrounds. Today, a monument exists at the site where Dahmer was killed in prison, although it remains a controversial site of interest for many people.</p><p>Dahmer's crimes had a lasting impact on both his victims' families and American society at large. He was known as the "Milwaukee Cannibal" and his case remains a subject of fascination and discussion in the media, including books, documentaries, and even movies. Dahmer's story has been the subject of numerous urban legends and myths, many of which are not true. The city of Milwaukee, where the majority of his crimes took place, has since worked to distance itself from the infamous serial killer.</p><p>In the years following Dahmer's death, many questions have been raised about his motivations and the social and cultural factors that may have contributed to his actions. His crimes have been studied extensively by criminal psychologists, and some have suggested that his alcoholism and deep-seated feelings of loneliness and isolation played a significant role in his crimes. Others have pointed to his troubled childhood and the trauma of his parents' divorce as possible factors.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, Dahmer's crimes remain a stark reminder of the horrors that human beings are capable of committing. His story has been a cautionary tale, warning against the dangers of unchecked mental illness and the need to take seriously the warning signs of dangerous behavior in others. Today, the memory of Dahmer's victims lives on, as loved ones continue to mourn their loss and the world at large struggles to come to terms with the tragedy that he inflicted.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by murder.

(December 17, 1937		New Orleans-March 26, 1969			Biloxi)


was
an American
author, writer, novelist, professor, journalist and soldier.


					</p><p>Toole is best known for his posthumously published novel, "A Confederacy of Dunces," which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1981. The novel was championed by author Walker Percy and Toole's mother, Thelma, who worked tirelessly to get the book published after her son's death. Toole struggled with mental illness throughout his life and his experiences in the military, academia, and the publishing industry all contributed to his struggles. However, his legacy endures and his work continues to be celebrated and studied by scholars and readers alike.</p><p>Toole's upbringing in New Orleans heavily influenced his writing, and the city's unique culture and language are prominent themes in "A Confederacy of Dunces." After receiving a Master's degree in English from Columbia University, Toole spent time in Puerto Rico teaching English and writing for various newspapers. He later taught at a number of colleges and universities, including Hunter College, the University of Southwestern Louisiana, and Tulane University. Throughout his life, Toole suffered from depression and was ultimately hospitalized for treatment. Despite his tragic end, his contributions to American literature are widely acknowledged and continue to be celebrated. In addition to "A Confederacy of Dunces", Toole's shorter works have also been published posthumously.</p><p>Toole's tragic death at the age of 31 cut short a promising career in writing and academia. However, his impact on American literature cannot be overstated. "A Confederacy of Dunces" is considered a classic of Southern literature and is often cited as one of the funniest novels ever written. Its complex protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, has become a beloved and enduring character in American fiction. In addition to his writing and teaching, Toole also served in the United States Army, where he trained as a linguist and worked as a propaganda writer for Radio Free Europe. Despite his struggles with mental illness, Toole was remembered by those who knew him as a brilliant and charismatic individual. His tragic death has led many to reflect on the struggles faced by artists and intellectuals, and the importance of supporting those struggling with mental illness.</p><p>Toole's writing career started at an early age, and he was known for his wit and humor even as a child. He was a voracious reader and had a passion for literature, which he would later pursue in his academic and professional life. After completing his Master's degree, Toole briefly worked as an English professor at Hunter College in New York City. He resigned from the position after only a few months and returned to New Orleans, where he struggled to find his place in the academic community. Toole's attempts to publish his work were also met with rejection, and he eventually fell into a deep depression. He was hospitalized several times and underwent electroshock therapy in an attempt to treat his mental illness.</p><p>Toole's mother, Thelma, was a significant influence on his literary career. She continued to champion his work after his death, advocating for its publication and pursuing legal action against those who she believed had plagiarized her son's writing. It was largely due to her efforts that "A Confederacy of Dunces" was finally published, and the novel was an instant success. The book's popularity led to Toole being posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1981, an honor that recognized the tremendous talent that had been lost too soon. </p><p>Toole's work continues to be studied and celebrated, and "A Confederacy of Dunces" remains a classic of Southern literature. The humor, satire, and unique characters in the novel have influenced countless writers, and Toole's legacy as a brilliant and complex literary figure endures.</p><p></p><p>
