(December 11, 1904		Port-au-Prince-August 13, 1975			Syracuse)

	
		also known as Philippe Marcelin

	
was
a Haitian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a renowned writer, journalist, and political figure who championed democracy, social justice, and freedom of the press in Haiti during a period marked by political turmoil and dictatorship. He co-founded the weekly newspaper "Le Nouvelliste" in 1898, which became one of the most influential Haitian newspapers. In addition to his newspaper work, he was also a prolific writer and author of several critically acclaimed novels, including "D'Une Prison A L'Autre" and "La Vierge aux Bandits." Throughout his career, Thoby-Marcelin was a vocal advocate of Haitian nationalism and culture and worked to promote the rich history and traditions of Haiti both nationally and internationally. Despite facing significant political persecution and censorship, he remained committed to his ideals and continued to speak out against oppression and injustice until his passing.</p><p>Thoby-Marcelin was born into a prominent Haitian family and received a high-quality education from some of the best schools in the country. He originally wanted to become a lawyer but soon discovered his passion for journalism, which led him to co-found "Le Nouvelliste" with Luckner Cambronne. Thoby-Marcelin believed that journalism was essential for informing the public and holding those in power accountable.</p><p>In addition to his work with "Le Nouvelliste," Thoby-Marcelin worked as a professor of literature and philosophy at the secondary school level. He was also a member of the Haitian Senate and served as the Minister of Education and Agriculture under the government of President Lescot. </p><p>Thoby-Marcelin's commitment to social justice led him to join the Haitian Democratic Unity Party (PUDH) in the 1940s. The party's primary goal was to promote democracy in Haiti, which was often marred by political corruption and authoritarian rule. Thoby-Marcelin advocated for a government that was more responsive to the needs of the Haitian people and that respected their basic rights.</p><p>Throughout his life, Thoby-Marcelin remained committed to his ideals, even when they put him at great personal risk. Despite facing censorship and persecution from the government, he continued to speak out against oppression and injustice. His legacy as a champion of Haitian democracy and culture continues to inspire generations of Haitians to this day.</p><p>Thoby-Marcelin's literary contributions were vital in enriching the Haitian literary scene. He contributed to the development of the Kreyol language as a legitimate literary language, a language that was disparaged and considered inadequate at the time. Thoby-Marcelin wrote extensively in Kreyol and was a prominent figure in the Kreyol language movement that sought to promote the language's use in literature, politics, and education. His works in Kreyol are still widely read and celebrated in Haiti today.</p><p>Thoby-Marcelin also played a crucial role in the founding of the Caribbean Writers Association, an organization that aimed to promote and support literature across the Caribbean. He strongly believed that Caribbean literature should be celebrated as a unique, vibrant, and essential part of the world's literary canon.</p><p>Despite his work in the political and literary spheres, Thoby-Marcelin remained a humble man. He was regarded as a warm and compassionate person who used his influence and success to empower his fellow Haitians. His passing in Syracuse, New York, was felt deeply across Haiti and the wider Caribbean region.</p><p>In recognition of his immense contributions to Haitian literature, journalism, and politics, several awards and prizes have been named in Thoby-Marcelin's honor. These include the Thoby-Marcelin Prize for Literature, which is awarded annually to Haitian writers, and the Philippe Thoby-Marcelin Award, which recognizes achievements in journalism in Haiti.</p><p></p><p>
