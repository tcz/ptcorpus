(February 22, 1903		Cambridge-January 19, 1930)

	
		also known as Frank Ramsey or Frank Plumpton Ramsey

	
was
a British
economist, philosopher, mathematician and scientist.


					</p><p>Ramsey made significant contributions to multiple fields during his short life, including philosophy, logic, mathematics, and economics. He is best known for his work in logic, where he developed the theory of truth that is now known as the redundancy theory. This theory suggests that in order to understand what is meant by a sentence, one simply needs to understand the relations between the words in that sentence.</p><p>In the field of economics, Ramsey was a pioneer of intertemporal analysis, which studies how people make decisions over time. His contributions to this area helped lay the foundation for modern macroeconomics. Ramsey also made important contributions to decision theory, which studies how people make decisions under conditions of uncertainty.</p><p>Ramsey's work in mathematics included the development of the Ramsey theory, which studies the conditions for the existence of a certain type of structure within a larger object. This work has important applications in computer science, combinatorics, and graph theory.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Ramsey's life was tragically cut short by jaundice at the age of only 26. Nonetheless, his contributions to a variety of fields have continued to influence research for decades after his death.</p><p>Ramsey grew up in a highly academic family - his father was a mathematician and president of Magdalene College, Cambridge, while his mother was a suffragist and social activist. Ramsey himself showed signs of intellectual brilliance at an early age, publishing his first paper in mathematics at the age of just 17. He went on to study at Cambridge, where he became a close friend of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.</p><p>Ramsey's work in philosophy was highly influential, particularly in the areas of semantics and metaphysics. He argued that truth is a property of whole propositions rather than individual statements, and he developed the notion of a ramified hierarchy to explain the logical relations between propositions.</p><p>Ramsey's contributions to economics were similarly ground-breaking. He developed the concept of optimal taxation, which seeks to balance the revenue-generating potential of taxation with the economic costs of raising taxes. He also formulated the idea of a Ramsey rule, which helps policymakers determine the optimal rate of consumption in an economy.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Ramsey was known for his modesty and humility, and he remained relatively unknown outside academic circles during his lifetime. It was only after his death that his work began to receive the recognition it deserved. Today, Ramsey's contributions to fields as diverse as philosophy, economics, and mathematics continue to inspire research and scholarship around the world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by jaundice.

					</p><p>Gerda Steinhoff was a German Nazi concentration camp guard during World War II. She served as a SS Aufseherin at the Stutthof concentration camp near Gdańsk, Poland, where she was responsible for overseeing the brutal persecution, torture, and killings of thousands of prisoners, many of whom were Jewish. In April 1946, Steinhoff was tried and convicted of war crimes by the Polish government and sentenced to death by hanging along with 10 other Stutthof personnel. At her trial, Steinhoff claimed that she was only following orders and was unaware of the true extent of the atrocities being committed. Despite this, she was executed on July 4, 1946, at the Biskupia Górka execution site. Her hanging was one of the first war crimes trials and executions to be carried out in the aftermath of World War II.</p><p>It is believed that Gerda Steinhoff was born in Gdańsk (then known as Danzig), Poland, to German parents. After completing her education, she joined the Nazi Party and became a member of the SS. In 1944, Steinhoff was assigned to the Stutthof concentration camp, which was located near her hometown. During her time at the camp, she was known for her cruelty towards the prisoners, and it is said that she took pleasure in beating and torturing them.</p><p>After the war ended and the Allies liberated the concentration camps, the Polish government set up a special commission to investigate war crimes at Stutthof. Steinhoff and 10 other Stutthof personnel were arrested and charged with crimes against humanity. At her trial, Steinhoff attempted to justify her actions by claiming that she was following orders and was unaware of the true nature of the atrocities being committed. However, her defense was not successful, and she was found guilty and sentenced to death.</p><p>Gerda Steinhoff's execution became a symbol of justice for the victims of the Holocaust and other war crimes. However, it is important to note that many other perpetrators of the Holocaust and other war crimes were never brought to justice. Today, Gerda Steinhoff's story serves as a reminder of the horrors that human beings are capable of inflicting upon each other and the importance of never forgetting the lessons of the past.</p><p></p><p>
