(April 23, 1883-May 6, 1929)

	
		also known as Dagmar Johanne Amalie Overbye

	
was
a Danish
personality.


					</p><p>She gained infamy as a child murderer in the early 20th century. Overbye worked as a nanny for multiple families, and between 1913 and 1920, she killed at least 25 children in her care, although the actual number may be much higher. Overbye was eventually caught and sentenced to death. Her case led to significant changes in Denmark's care system for orphans and children in foster care.</p><p>Overbye was born in Frederiksberg, Denmark and had a difficult childhood. Her parents were unmarried, and her mother struggled to raise her and her siblings. Overbye left school at a young age and started working as a nanny. She married at the age of 19 and had two children of her own, but the marriage ended in divorce.</p><p>Overbye's crimes were discovered in 1920 when police found the body of a child in a Copenhagen park. During the investigation, Overbye was found to have killed several other children. She confessed to her crimes and was tried and sentenced to death in 1921.</p><p>The case received widespread media attention in Denmark and abroad, and many theories about her motives were put forward. Some believed that Overbye suffered from mental illness, while others suggested that she killed the children for financial gain, as she was paid for her services as a nanny.</p><p>After her death sentence was commuted to life in prison, Overbye spent the rest of her days in solitary confinement. Her case prompted changes to Denmark's child welfare system and laws governing the employment of nannies.</p><p>Despite the horrific nature of her crimes, Overbye has remained a subject of fascination in Denmark and around the world. Her story has been the subject of books, documentaries, and even a play.</p><p>During her trial, it was revealed that Overbye had used various methods to kill the children, including strangulation, drowning, and poisoning with morphine. She would then dispose of their bodies by burying them or burning them in a furnace. Overbye's actions were especially shocking because she had been entrusted with the care of these children by their parents. </p><p>After her arrest, Overbye showed no remorse for her crimes and even boasted that she had killed more children than she was accused of. She claimed that the children were all "ill-born," and that she was doing society a favor by getting rid of them. </p><p>Overbye has been the subject of many different interpretations and theories, with some suggesting that she was a psychopath capable of committing heinous crimes without feeling any empathy for her victims. Others have said that she suffered from postpartum depression and that her own difficult upbringing may have contributed to her behavior. </p><p>Despite the many unanswered questions surrounding her motives, Overbye's case remains a fascinating and tragic chapter in Danish history.</p><p>Her trial and sentencing were widely covered in the media, and her story quickly became a national sensation. Many people were horrified by her crimes and demanded justice for the innocent children she had killed. There were also debates about whether she was of sound mind when she committed the murders, and whether she deserved the death penalty.</p><p>In the years since Dagmar Overbye's death, her story has continued to captivate the public's imagination. Her case has been the subject of numerous books, newspaper articles, and documentaries, and she has been the inspiration for several works of art and literature.</p><p>Despite the passage of time, her crimes remain a chilling reminder of the dangers of trusting strangers with the care of vulnerable children. Her case has also served as a catalyst for positive changes in Denmark's childcare system, ensuring that tragedies like this one are never repeated again.</p><p></p><p>
