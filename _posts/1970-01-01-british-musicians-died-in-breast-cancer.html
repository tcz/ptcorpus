She was known for her roles in action films, often appearing alongside her husband Charles Bronson. </p><p>In addition to acting, Ireland was also a successful author, writing several books including "Life Wish" (1987) and "Lifescripts: What to Say to Get What You Want in Life's Toughest Situations" (1989).</p><p>Ireland was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1984 and underwent a double mastectomy. She became an advocate for cancer awareness and established the Jill Ireland Fund for Breast Cancer Research before her death in 1990.</p><p>In her early career, Ireland trained at the Rank Organisation's "charm school", an institution in the UK that groomed actors for stardom. In the late 1950s, she moved to Hollywood and landed a contract with 20th Century Fox. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, she appeared in several TV shows, including "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." and "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea". Ireland went on to star in her own TV series, "Shane," in the early 1960s. Her marriage to Charles Bronson, whom she met on the set of "The Great Escape" (1963), proved to be one of Hollywood's most enduring partnerships. She was his leading lady in many films, including "Breakheart Pass" (1975) and "St. Ives" (1976). After Ireland's death, Bronson established the "Jill Ireland Memorial Fund for AIDS Research" in her honor.</p><p>Ireland was born as Jill Dorothy Ireland in London and spent her early childhood in India, before moving back to England in her teenage years. She began her career as a ballet dancer, performing with the London Festival Ballet at the age of 12. After being scouted by a talent agent, Ireland auditioned for a role in the film "Simon and Laura" and landed the part, kickstarting her acting career.</p><p>In addition to her work in film and television, Ireland also worked on stage, appearing on Broadway in "The Live Wire" with Lloyd Bridges in 1950. She also wrote and produced her own play, "Something About a Soldier," which debuted in London's West End in 1960.</p><p>Ireland and Bronson were married in 1968, and together they adopted a daughter, Zuleika. Ireland was stepmother to Bronson's two children from a previous marriage, and the couple went on to have a daughter together, Katrina. Despite the challenges they faced, including Ireland's cancer diagnosis, their marriage remained strong until her death.</p><p>In addition to her advocacy work for breast cancer research, Ireland also supported other charitable causes throughout her life. She was a lifetime member of the Children's Charity Variety Club and served as a spokesperson for the National Hemophilia Foundation. Ireland's legacy as both an actor and philanthropist continues to inspire many today.</p><p>Ireland's acting career spanned several decades, during which she became known for her beauty, poise and versatility. She was equally comfortable in dramatic roles and comedies, and she was praised for her ability to convey complex emotions on screen. In addition to her work as an actor, Ireland was an accomplished author, with several books to her credit. She also hosted her own radio talk show, "The Jill Ireland Show," in the 1970s.</p><p>Despite her success, Ireland faced several challenges throughout her life. In addition to her battle with cancer, she struggled with addiction and underwent treatment for alcoholism in the 1970s. Ireland also faced criticism from some quarters for her decision to continue working as an actor while raising her children. However, she remained committed to her craft and her family, and her dedication to both endeared her to her fans and colleagues.</p><p>Today, Ireland is remembered not only for her talents as an actor and writer, but also for her tireless work as a cancer advocate and philanthropist. Her legacy continues to inspire those who knew her and those who have come to admire her work in the years since her passing.</p><p></p><p>
