(August 18, 1932		Sindhri-March 16, 1993			Islamabad)


was
a Pakistani
politician.


					</p><p>He served as the 9th Prime Minister of Pakistan, from 1985 until 1988. Junejo was born in Sindhri, Sindh province, and received his education at the University of Sindh and later at the University of California, Berkeley. He began his political career as a member of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and was initially close to its founder, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. However, he later joined the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) and was appointed as Prime Minister by General Zia-ul-Haq, who had overthrown Bhutto's government in a military coup. </p><p>Junejo's tenure as Prime Minister was marked by various challenges and controversies, including the high-handedness of the military establishment, the Afghan War, and a growing opposition movement led by Benazir Bhutto. Despite these challenges, Junejo pursued policies to strengthen the country's economy, promote regional integration and improve ties with neighboring countries.</p><p>In 1988, Junejo's government was dismissed by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, which led to the end of his political career. He later formed his own party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Junejo (PML-J), but it failed to gain popularity. Muhammad Khan Junejo died in Islamabad on March 16, 1993, after a prolonged illness.</p><p>Junejo's political career began in the early 1970s, when he was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan as a member of the Pakistan Peoples Party. He soon became a prominent figure in the party and held several key positions, including Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Minister of Industries and Production, and Minister of Commerce. He was also appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission by Prime Minister Bhutto.</p><p>In 1983, Junejo left the PPP and joined the Pakistan Muslim League under the leadership of Mohammad Khan Sherani. This move was seen as a betrayal by many of his former colleagues in the PPP, including Benazir Bhutto, who was then in exile.</p><p>After assuming power as Prime Minister, Junejo faced numerous challenges, including the increasing influence of the military establishment over the civilian government, the Soviet occupation of neighboring Afghanistan, and unrest in the province of Sindh. Despite these challenges, he managed to implement several significant policy changes, including the introduction of measures to improve the welfare of farmers and laborers, and the opening up of the economy to foreign investment.</p><p>Junejo was a vocal advocate of regional cooperation and played a key role in the creation of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in 1985, which brought together the countries of South Asia to promote economic integration and development.</p><p>In the later years of his political career, Junejo became increasingly critical of the military's role in Pakistan's politics and called for greater civilian control over the government. He was dismissed by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1988, following a dispute over the legitimacy of the elections held under his government.</p><p>Despite his contributions to Pakistani politics, Muhammad Khan Junejo remains a somewhat controversial figure. Some see him as a statesman who tried to steer Pakistan towards democracy, while others believe that he was a weak leader who was unable to challenge the military's dominance.</p><p></p><p>
