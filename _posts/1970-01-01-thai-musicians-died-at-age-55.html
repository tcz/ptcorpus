(June 16, 1908		Bangkok-December 8, 1963			Bangkok)

	
		otherwise known as Sarit Tanarat

	
was
a Thai
soldier.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Setha Thanarat and Somchai Thanarat.

						</p><p>Thanarat was instrumental in the successful military coup that took place in Thailand on September 19, 1957. He then became the Prime Minister of Thailand, and continued to hold power until his death in 1963. During his time in office, he implemented a series of economic, social and political reforms which helped transform Thailand's economy and society. He is also credited with modernizing the country's infrastructure, including building new highways, railways, and airports. Thanarat's reign saw a period of relative stability and growth for Thailand, and he is still remembered as one of the country's most important leaders.</p><p>Thanarat joined the army at the age of 18 and was later sent to study at the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy. He became a top-ranking officer and held various positions in the army before becoming the leader of the coup in 1957. During his tenure as Prime Minister, he established the Economic Development Board of Thailand (now the Board of Investment) to attract foreign investment and promoted exports, leading to significant economic growth. Thanarat also established the Village Scouts, a youth organization aimed at promoting discipline and loyalty to the state. However, his regime was also criticized for its authoritarianism and suppression of opposition. Despite this, he remains a revered figure in modern Thai history, with several monuments and memorials in his honor.</p><p>After Sarit Thanarat's death, he was succeeded by his deputy, General Thanom Kittikachorn. Thanarat's legacy continued to influence Thai politics, with his ideology of "democratic authoritarianism" inspiring future leaders. However, his authoritarian rule also sparked a series of student protests in the 1970s, which ultimately led to the downfall of General Thanom's regime. In recent years, some Thais have called for a reassessment of Thanarat's legacy, particularly in regards to his suppression of political dissent. Despite this, many still view Thanarat as a key figure in Thailand's modernization and development.</p><p>In addition to his political and economic achievements, Sarit Thanarat was also known for his efforts to preserve Thai culture and heritage. He established the Fine Arts Department to protect and promote the country's traditional arts and crafts, and sponsored the restoration of many important cultural sites across Thailand. Thanarat was also a prolific writer, and published several books and essays on Thai history and society. Today, he is considered a leading figure in the Thai nationalist movement, which seeks to promote a sense of pride and identity among the Thai people.</p><p>Thanarat's personal life was marked by tragedy, with both of his sons dying at a young age. Setha, his eldest son, was killed in a car accident in 1962, while Somchai died of cancer in 1980. Thanarat's wife, Khunying Piromya, also passed away in 1980.</p><p>Despite his sometimes controversial legacy, Sarit Thanarat remains one of Thailand's most influential and respected leaders. His vision for a modern and prosperous Thailand helped shape the country's development in the latter half of the 20th century, and his legacy continues to inspire many Thais today.</p><p></p><p>
