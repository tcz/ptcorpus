					</p><p>Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo, also known as Bapak Subuh, was an Indonesian spiritual leader and founder of the spiritual practice known as the Subud movement. Born into a devout Muslim family in Java, Indonesia, he began practicing meditation and other spiritual practices from a young age. In the late 1920s, he experienced a profound spiritual awakening while meditating in a forest in Java. Following this experience, he began to teach his own unique form of spiritual practice, which he called latihan kejiwaan, or simply "the latihan." </p><p>Over the years, Bapak Subuh's teachings gained a following in Indonesia and eventually spread to other parts of the world, including Europe, North America, and Australia. Under his leadership, the Subud movement grew into a global network of spiritual communities and centers, with thousands of members in countries around the world. Bapak Subuh passed away on April 5, 1987, but his teachings and the Subud movement continue to inspire people to this day.</p><p>Bapak Subuh's teachings center around the concept of surrendering oneself to the spiritual power of the universe, which he believed would bring about a state of enlightenment and inner peace. His spiritual practice, the latihan, involves surrendering oneself to this power through spontaneous physical movements and vocalizations. He emphasized the importance of individual experience and understanding, rather than adhering to any set doctrine or belief system.</p><p>Aside from his spiritual pursuits, Bapak Subuh was also a successful businessman, having worked in various industries including textiles and real estate. He was known for his philanthropic efforts, particularly in education and healthcare. In 1956, he established the Subud International Cultural Association (SICA), which aimed to promote cross-cultural understanding and collaboration through various artistic and cultural initiatives.</p><p>Bapak Subuh's influence extends beyond the Subud movement, with many individuals from various spiritual and cultural backgrounds finding inspiration in his teachings. He continues to be remembered as a significant figure in Indonesian and world spirituality.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to spiritual development and world peace, Bapak Subuh was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding in 1977. He remained dedicated to his teachings until the end of his life, often traveling to different parts of the world to spread the message of the latihan. Bapak Subuh also wrote a number of books on spirituality, including "The Origin of Life According to the Latihan Kejiwaan" and "The Message from the Soul". Despite his success and influence, Bapak Subuh remained a humble and unassuming figure, dedicating his life to the service of others and the pursuit of spiritual understanding. Today, the Subud movement continues to thrive, with centers and communities in more than 80 countries around the world.</p><p>Bapak Subuh's impact on spiritual development and cross-cultural understanding earned him the nickname "The Father of the Spiritual Revolution". He also played a role in advancing interfaith dialogue, meeting with leaders of different religions to promote mutual respect and understanding. Bapak Subuh was a strong advocate for personal growth and self-development, encouraging his followers to take responsibility for their own spiritual journeys. He believed that the latihan could help individuals achieve a higher level of consciousness and connection to the divine. Beyond his spiritual teachings, Bapak Subuh was known for his warm and compassionate personality, often spending time with his followers and working to help those in need. His legacy continues to inspire people around the world to seek inner peace and spiritual enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>
