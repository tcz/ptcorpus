was
a British
personality.


					</p><p>Charles Sorley was a Scottish poet and a soldier during the First World War. He was educated in England and Germany before the war broke out. When war was declared, Sorley enlisted in the British Army and served as an officer in the Suffolk Regiment. He was sent to France in 1915, where he saw action at the Battle of Loos. Sorley was killed by a sniper in the Battle of Hulluch in October 1915. Despite his relatively short life, Sorley is considered to be one of the leading poets of the First World War, and his work has been widely studied and anthologised.</p><p>Sorley's poetry was greatly influenced by his experiences during the war, and he often wrote about the horrors of trench warfare and the loss of life that he witnessed firsthand. His most famous poem, "When You See Millions of the Mouthless Dead," is a powerful and haunting reflection on the aftermath of battle. In addition to his poetry, Sorley was also an accomplished scholar and linguist, and he was fluent in German, French, and Italian. His untimely death at the age of 20 cut short what could have been a remarkable career in both poetry and academia. Despite his short life, Sorley's poetry continues to be widely read and admired, and he is remembered as one of the great poets of the First World War.</p><p>After Sorley's death, his poems were collected and published posthumously in 1916 in a volume titled "Marlborough and Other Poems." This collection includes some of his most celebrated works, including "Two Sonnets" and "All the Hills and Vales Along." Sorley's poetry has been praised for its clarity and economy of language, as well as its ability to convey the brutal realities of war in a way that is both poignant and restrained. His work has influenced many other poets who came after him, including Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen. In addition to his literary achievements, Sorley is also remembered as a highly intelligent and thoughtful young man who was deeply committed to his country and his fellow soldiers. His letters and diaries offer a glimpse into the mind of a young man grappling with the challenges of war and searching for meaning in a time of great upheaval. Sorley's legacy continues to be celebrated today through literary awards and scholarships, as well as through ongoing research on his life and work.</p><p></p><p>

(May 27, 1922-April 29, 1943			Tunisia)


was
a British
personality.


					</p><p>Sidney Keyes was an English poet and soldier. He was born in Dartford, Kent and educated at Bickley Hall School, Repton and finally at Oxford University. In 1941, he joined the British Armed Forces to fight in World War II. During his time in the forces, he served in North Africa, Italy and Greece. He also wrote extensively about his experiences in his poetry. Keyes’ poetry reflected the horrors of war and explored the theme of young men going to fight for their country. Keyes' work was widely acclaimed and he became one of the leading voices of the World War II generation. Tragically, he was killed in action in 1943, aged just 20 years old. Despite his young age and short career, Keyes’ poetry had a profound impact on the literary world and continues to influence contemporary poets today.</p><p>One of Sidney Keyes' most famous works was his collection of poems titled "The Cruel Solstice," published in 1943 shortly before his death. The collection included poems that expressed his disillusionment with war and his struggle to find meaning in it, as well as reflections on his own mortality as a soldier. Keyes was also known for his friendship with fellow poet Keith Douglas, who was also a soldier and died in battle. The two corresponded through poetry and their shared experiences of war, which influenced both of their works. Keyes' legacy as a poet and soldier is celebrated by the Sidney Keyes Memorial Trust, which awards an annual prize for poetry in his honor.</p><p>Additionally, Sidney Keyes was known for his involvement with the romantic poet group called the Apocalyptic poets. He was among the youngest of the group and was often referred to as the "boy poet." Keyes was also an admirer of T.S Eliot and his work was influenced by Eliot's modernist style of poetry. During his time at Oxford University, Keyes was an active member of the university's poetry society and contributed to its magazine, The Isis. Despite his young age, Keyes was known for his maturity and deep understanding of the complexities of war and life, which was evident in his poetry. Today, he is considered one of the most promising poets of his generation, whose life and career were sadly cut short by the war.</p><p></p><p>
