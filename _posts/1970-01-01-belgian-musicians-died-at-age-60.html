(July 9, 1895		Switzerland-June 30, 1956			Bad Schwalbach)


was
a Belgian
personality.


					</p><p>Correction: Julius Lippert was actually a German politician and member of the Nazi Party. He was born on July 9, 1895 in Berlin, Germany and died on June 30, 1956 in Bad Schwalbach, Germany. </p><p>Lippert joined the NSDAP (Nazi Party) in 1926 and soon became the Gauleiter (regional party leader) of Berlin. He was known for his anti-Semitic views and played a major role in the persecution of Jews in Berlin during World War II.

However, his involvement in the Nazi Party ultimately overshadowed his prior scholarly pursuits.
