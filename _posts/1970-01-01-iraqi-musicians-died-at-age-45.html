					</p><p>Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr was an Iraqi Shia cleric and philosopher, who remains a prominent figure in Shia Islam today. He was born in the holy city of Kadhimiya in 1935 and grew up to become a leading voice in the Iraqi Shia community. He was a prolific author, writing on a range of topics including Islamic law, economics, and politics. </p><p>During his lifetime, al-Sadr was a vocal critic of the Iraqi Baathist regime and advocate for Shia political mobilization. He founded the Islamic Da'wa Party in 1957, which continues to play a central role in Iraqi politics. </p><p>Al-Sadr's opposition to the Baath regime led to his execution in 1980, along with his sister Amina. The executions sparked widespread protests and are viewed by many Shia Muslims as a martyrdom. Al-Sadr's legacy continues to influence Iraqi politics and Shia Islamic thought to this day.</p><p>Al-Sadr's father was a prominent Shia scholar as well, and this influenced his upbringing and education. Al-Sadr earned a degree in Islamic jurisprudence from the Najaf Seminary, and later studied philosophy and economics at the University of Paris. His academic background and religious knowledge made him a revered figure in the eyes of many Iraqis, particularly Shia Muslims who felt oppressed under the Baath regime. Al-Sadr's political activism landed him in jail several times throughout his life, but he remained steadfast in his beliefs and continued to write and speak out against oppression and injustice.</p><p>In addition to his political activism and scholarly work, al-Sadr also founded numerous charities and organizations that provided social services to the impoverished and marginalized in Iraqi society. His emphasis on social justice and economic equality is still seen as a cornerstone of Shia Islamic thought, and continues to inspire activists and scholars around the world.</p><p>Al-Sadr's legacy has been commemorated in numerous ways, including through the establishment of the al-Sadr City neighborhood in Baghdad, named in his honor, and the Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr Foundation, which promotes Islamic scholarship and social justice initiatives. His ideas and teachings remain relevant to contemporary debates over minority rights, economic justice, and political mobilization.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by capital punishment.
