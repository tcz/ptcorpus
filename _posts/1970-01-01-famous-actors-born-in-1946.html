							André the Giant was known for his enormous size, standing at over 7 feet tall and weighing over 500 pounds. He began his wrestling career in France and eventually became a worldwide superstar in the sport, competing in promotions such as WWF (now WWE) and NWA. He is perhaps best known for his role in the 1987 film "The Princess Bride," in which he played the character Fezzik. Despite his intimidating size, André was known for his kind personality and was beloved by many who knew him. He suffered from acromegaly, a condition caused by excess growth hormone, which contributed to his enormous size and eventual health issues. He passed away in his sleep at the age of 46 due to heart failure. André the Giant's legacy as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time continues to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=2575" title="Wikipedia article about André the Giant">André the Giant on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Dan O&#039;Bannon</h2><p><strong>Dan O&#039;Bannon</strong>
