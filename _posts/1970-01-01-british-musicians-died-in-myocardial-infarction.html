was
a British
magician, comedian and actor.

						</p><p>Tommy Cooper was known for his unique style of comedy which combined magic tricks, slapstick and hilarious one-liners. He gained national fame in the UK during the 1960s and 70s with his appearances on television programs such as "The Benny Hill Show" and his own program "Cooperama". He was also a frequent performer at the famous London Palladium.</p><p>Despite his success, Tommy Cooper was known for his humble and down-to-earth personality. His trademark fez and red jacket became iconic symbols of his comedic appeal. Sadly, Cooper suffered a heart attack and collapsed in the middle of a live performance on the television show "Live From Her Majesty's" in 1984. He was rushed to the hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival. Tommy Cooper's legacy continues to inspire generations of comedians and magicians around the world.</p><p>Throughout his career, Tommy Cooper received numerous awards and recognition for his contribution to the entertainment industry. He was awarded the prestigious Variety Club of Great Britain award for 'BBC personality of the year' in 1967 and again in 1973. In 1981, he was awarded the BAFTA for 'Best Light Entertainment Programme' for his show, 'Tommy Cooper Hour'. </p><p>Tommy Cooper's popularity was not limited to the UK, as he also gained a huge following in Australia and New Zealand, where he toured extensively in the 1970s.

He is remembered as one of the greatest comedians of all time and his influence on the entertainment industry can still be seen today.</p><p>One interesting fact about Tommy Cooper is that despite his success, he had a fear of performing live. He would often suffer from stage fright and pre-show nerves, but his love for entertaining and making people laugh always pushed him to go on stage. Another lesser-known aspect of his life is his passion for painting. Cooper was an avid painter and would often spend his spare time creating art. Some of his paintings were even exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts. Tommy Cooper's life was told in a posthumous biography written by his friend and collaborator, John Fisher. The book, titled "Tommy Cooper: Always Leave Them Laughing", gave an intimate look into Cooper's life and career, and was well received by fans and critics alike.</p><p></p><p>

						</p><p>Doyle is best known for creating the character of Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective in over 60 stories. He also wrote historical novels such as "The White Company" and "Sir Nigel," as well as science fiction and fantasy stories. Doyle's work has had a lasting impact on popular culture and his portrayal of Holmes has been adapted into numerous films, television shows, and stage productions. In addition to his literary career, Doyle was a fervent advocate of justice and wrote extensively on the wrongful conviction of George Edalji, leading to his eventual exoneration. He was knighted in 1902 for his services to literature and died at the age of 71.</p><p>Doyle's interest in spiritualism and psychic phenomena was a major influence in his later works. He was a member of the Society for Psychical Research and wrote books on spiritualism, such as "The New Revelation" and "The Vital Message," which he claimed were based on his own experiences. Doyle's fascination with the paranormal led to a strained relationship with his friend, Harry Houdini, who was skeptical of spiritualism. </p><p>During World War I, Doyle served as a volunteer physician in a field hospital in France, where he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. He also wrote propaganda pamphlets for the British government to support the war effort. In his later years, Doyle became involved in politics and ran unsuccessfully for Parliament three times. He was a strong advocate for the use of motor vehicles and was an avid sportsman, playing cricket, golf, and football. </p><p>Today, Doyle is remembered as one of the greatest writers of the Victorian era and his Sherlock Holmes stories continue to captivate readers around the world. His legacy as a writer and social justice advocate is celebrated through the Arthur Conan Doyle Society, which was founded in 1990 to promote the study and appreciation of his life and work.</p><p>Doyle studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and began his career as a physician, but his true passion was writing. In addition to creating Sherlock Holmes, he also wrote numerous other detective stories, adventure tales, and plays. His literary success allowed him to pursue a variety of other interests, including travel and sports. Doyle was an accomplished athlete who was a member of various sports teams, including the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Crowborough Golf Club. He was also a keen advocate for the benefits of physical fitness and healthy living. Despite his achievements as a writer, Doyle frequently felt unfulfilled and struggled with depression. He turned to spiritualism as a means of finding comfort and meaning in his life, and his belief in the paranormal continued to shape his work until his death. Today, Doyle's contribution to literature and popular culture is widely recognized, and his legacy as a writer, physician, and advocate for social justice continues to inspire generations of readers and scholars.</p><p></p><p>
