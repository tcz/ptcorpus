However, it was his work on the radio program "Les Grosses Têtes" that made him a household name. The show featured a panel of comedians who engaged in witty banter and wordplay, and Doris was its anchor for many years. His warm, avuncular presence and sharp sense of humor endeared him to audiences across France, and he remained a beloved figure in the country's comedy scene until his death.</p><p>In addition to his successful career in entertainment, Pierre Doris was also a prolific writer. He wrote several books, including an autobiography titled "Les trois coups de minuit" and a novel called "Scènes de ménage".
