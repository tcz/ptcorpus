He often played romantic leads and his charming and suave screen persona made him a sex symbol of the time. During World War II, he continued to work in films, despite being conscripted into the German Army. He later claimed that he had only stayed in Germany during the war because he did not want to leave his elderly mother. After the war, he continued his career and became a beloved icon of German entertainment.
