He also established new cities and built several fortresses, which helped him maintain control over the newly acquired territories. Ladislaus IV was a patron of culture and arts and was himself a gifted musician and poet. He was also a devout Catholic and made several religious foundations during his reign. Unfortunately, his sudden death at the age of 27 cut short his efforts to establish a powerful Hungarian Kingdom. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Andrew III.</p><p></p><p>
