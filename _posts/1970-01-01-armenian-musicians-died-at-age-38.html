His life and works have inspired many Armenian writers, artists, and intellectuals, and he remains an important figure in Armenian literature and cultural history.</p><p>Abovian's "Verk Hayastani" (The Book of Armenia) was an ambitious project that aimed to document Armenian culture, history, geography, language, literature, and religion. The work, which took Abovian over a decade to complete, was intended to serve as a comprehensive reference for Armenian readers and scholars. Unfortunately, Abovian did not live to see the final publication of his masterpiece. The manuscript was lost for many years before being rediscovered in the early 20th century.</p><p>Abovian's contribution to Armenian literature was not only in the content of his works but also in the language he used. He wrote in Eastern Armenian, which was not the dominant form of Armenian at the time.

He was frequently harassed and surveilled by the authorities, and his writings were often censored or banned. Despite these challenges, Abovian continued to write and advocate for Armenian cultural and political rights.</p><p>Abovian's influence has not been limited to Armenian culture. His writings have also had an impact on Russian literature, as many Russian writers were inspired by his use of Eastern Armenian and his exploration of Armenian identity.

The museum houses exhibits related to Abovian's life and works, as well as artifacts related to Armenian history and culture. Additionally, in 1969, the Soviet government issued a postage stamp commemorating the 160th anniversary of Abovian's birth.</p><p>Despite the Soviet government's recognition of Abovian's contributions, his legacy was also used for political purposes during the Soviet period.
