		a.k.a. Achmad Sukarno, Soekarno, Kusno Sosrodihardjo, Dr. Ahmed Sukarno, Bung Karno or Pak Karno

						</p><p>Sukarno was the first president of Indonesia, serving from 1945 to 1967. He was a prominent leader in the country's struggle for independence from Dutch colonial rule and is considered a national hero in Indonesia. Sukarno was known for his charisma, oratory skills and nationalist vision, which he expressed through his philosophy of "Pancasila". He was also an avid supporter of socialism and worked tirelessly to implement socialist policies in Indonesia. However, his tenure as president was marred by political turmoil and economic instability, which eventually led to his ousting in 1967 by General Suharto. Sukarno spent the rest of his life under house arrest and died in 1970 at the age of 69. Despite the controversies surrounding his presidency, Sukarno remains a popular and respected figure in Indonesia.</p><p>Sukarno was born into a Javanese aristocratic family and spent much of his childhood studying traditional Javanese art and culture. He later attended a Dutch-run technical school before studying architecture in Bandung. It was during this time that he began to develop his political ideology and became involved in nationalist movements. In 1927, Sukarno established the Indonesian Nationalist Party and became its first president.</p><p>During World War II, Sukarno cooperated with the Japanese occupiers in hopes of gaining independence for Indonesia. When Japan surrendered in August 1945, he proclaimed Indonesia's independence and became its first president. Under his leadership, Indonesia united various ethnic groups and nationalities and began to build a thriving economy.</p><p>Sukarno pursued a policy of neutrality during the Cold War, trying to maintain good relationships with both the United States and the Soviet Union. However, his socialist policies and alignment with leftist governments in Cuba and China drew criticism from Western powers. This, along with economic struggles and allegations of corruption, led to increasing unrest in Indonesia.</p><p>In 1965, a failed coup attempt was blamed on communists and led to a violent anti-communist purge throughout Indonesia. The military, led by Suharto, seized power and accused Sukarno of being a communist sympathizer. He was placed under house arrest and stripped of his presidential powers before eventually being forced to resign in 1967.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Sukarno is still remembered as an influential leader and a symbol of Indonesian nationalism. His philosophy of Pancasila is enshrined in the country's constitution and his face appears on the country's banknotes.</p><p></p><p>
