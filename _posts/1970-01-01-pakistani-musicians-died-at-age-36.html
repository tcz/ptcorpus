					</p><p>Considered as one of the pioneers of modern art in Pakistan, Ahmed Pervez was known for his geometric abstraction and use of bold and vibrant colors. He studied at the Mayo School of Arts in Lahore and went on to exhibit his work extensively both nationally and internationally. He also served as the principal of Karachi School of Arts from 1963 to 1967. Pervez's work has been featured in several prestigious exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale and the Tokyo Biennale. He was awarded the President's Pride of Performance Award in 1966 for his contributions to Pakistani art.</p><p>Ahmed Pervez's art was influenced by traditional Islamic patterns and calligraphy, as well as Western modernist movements such as Cubism and Abstract Expressionism. He was particularly known for his use of the chevron or zigzag motif, which he used to create patterns of intense and contrasting colors. Some of his most famous works include "Zig Zag Zen," "The One," and "Four Seasons." Pervez's legacy as an artist has continued to influence Pakistani art to this day, with his work inspiring younger generations of artists to explore geometric abstraction and use of bold color. In his later years, Pervez suffered from Parkinson's disease, which led to a decline in his artistic output. He passed away on his 36th birthday in 1979.</p><p>Despite his early death, Ahmed Pervez is remembered as one of the most influential artists in the South Asian modernist movement. He is widely regarded as a trailblazer who paved the way for future artists to carve out their own unique styles by pulling from both traditional and contemporary art forms. Pervez's contribution to Pakistani art has been recognized on numerous occasions, with retrospectives of his work held at the Lahore Museum and the National Art Gallery in Islamabad. His legacy in the art community has also been commemorated through various scholarship programs and prizes named after him, honoring his contributions to modernist art in Pakistan.</p><p>In addition to his artistic achievements, Ahmed Pervez was also a dedicated teacher and mentor to many young artists in Pakistan. He believed in the importance of art education and played an instrumental role in establishing art schools throughout the country. Pervez's passion for art extended beyond his own work and he was committed to elevating the entire art community in Pakistan.</p><p>Pervez's influence on the art world was not limited to his native country. His work has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world, including in Saudi Arabia, India, France, and the United States. His unique style and use of color continue to captivate audiences and inspire artists today.</p><p>Despite his success and acclaim, Pervez remained humble and dedicated to his craft until his passing. He once said, "I paint because I must. It is something that is inside me and must find expression. I hope that my paintings will speak to others and bring them some kind of joy or peace."</p><p>Ahmed Pervez's contributions to modernist art in Pakistan and beyond have made him a beloved figure in the art world. He is remembered as a visionary artist and a true pioneer who pushed boundaries and influenced generations of artists to come.</p><p></p><p>
