Bagapsh was widely regarded as a populist leader who was able to bridge political divides and unite the diverse ethnic groups of Abkhazia under his leadership. Despite his relatively short time in office, he was a key figure in Abkhazian politics and is remembered as one of the country's most important leaders.</p><p></p><p>
