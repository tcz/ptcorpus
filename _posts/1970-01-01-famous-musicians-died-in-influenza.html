(August 25, 1880		Rome-November 9, 1918			Paris)

	
		also known as Wilhelm Albert Włodzimierz Apolinary Kostrowicki, Guillelmus Apollinaris De Kostrowitzki, Wilhelm Albert Włodzimierz Apollinaris de Wąż-Kostrowicky or Wilhelm Albert Vladimir Apollonaris de Kostrowicki

	
was
a French
writer, art critic, poet and playwright.


					</p><p>Apollinaire was born in Rome to a Polish mother and a father who may have been either Italian or Polish. He spent much of his youth traveling throughout Europe and studying in various cities. He became involved with the artistic and literary circles of Paris, and his work was heavily influenced by the avant-garde movements of the early twentieth century.</p><p>Apollinaire was a prolific writer, producing numerous volumes of poetry, essays, and plays. He is perhaps best known for his collection of poems, "Alcools," which was published in 1913 and is considered a landmark work of modernist literature. He also wrote a number of plays, including "The Breasts of Tiresias," which is often cited as one of the first examples of surrealist theater.</p><p>In addition to his literary work, Apollinaire was a passionate art critic and supporter of contemporary art. He was friends with many of the leading artists of the day, including Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he was instrumental in introducing the works of the Italian futurists to a wider audience.</p><p>Apollinaire died in 1918 at the age of 38, just two days before the end of World War I. His legacy as a writer and critic has continued to grow in the decades since his death, and he is now widely regarded as one of the most influential and innovative figures of twentieth-century literature.</p><p>Despite Apollinaire's many accomplishments, his personal life was marked by turbulence and tragedy. He suffered from health problems throughout his life, including a serious head injury sustained during World War I that left him with occasional lapses in memory and coordination. He also had numerous affairs and relationships that were often fraught with drama and heartbreak.</p><p>One of Apollinaire's most famous romantic entanglements was with the artist Marie Laurencin, with whom he had a tumultuous relationship that spanned many years. Despite their ups and downs, the two artists remained close until Apollinaire's death.</p><p>Another notable aspect of Apollinaire's life was his military service during World War I. He enlisted in the French army in 1914 and served on the front lines, where he was twice wounded. He was later discharged due to health problems related to his injuries.</p><p>Despite his relatively short life and troubled personal history, Apollinaire exerted a profound influence on the literary and artistic movements of his time. His innovative approach to language, imagery, and form helped to pave the way for the development of modernism and surrealism, and his work remains relevant and inspiring to this day.</p><p></p><p>
