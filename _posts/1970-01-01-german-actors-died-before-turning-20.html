							Paul Graetz was born in Berlin, Germany on February 16, 1889. He was a prominent figure in German theater and film in the early 20th century, and appeared in over 80 films during his career, including the classic silent film "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" (1920). As the Nazi party came to power in Germany, Graetz, who was Jewish, fled to the United States, settling in Hollywood. Despite language barriers and the challenges of adapting to a new country, Graetz continued his acting career, appearing in American films such as "Casablanca" (1942) and "To Be or Not to Be" (1942). Sadly, he passed away on his 54th birthday in 1943, just a few months after his final film, "The Song of Bernadette" (1943), was released. Despite his relatively short career in Hollywood, Graetz left an indelible mark on the history of film, and is remembered as a talented actor whose work helped shape the early days of cinema in both Europe and America.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=31278776" title="Wikipedia article about Paul Graetz">Paul Graetz on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Luigi Bonos</h2><p><strong>Luigi Bonos</strong>
