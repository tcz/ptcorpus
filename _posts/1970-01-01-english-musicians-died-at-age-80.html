was
an English
watchmaker.


					</p><p>He is widely regarded as a pioneer in the field of marine chronometry and is credited with inventing several key technologies used in the production of timepieces, such as the bimetallic compensation balance.</p><p>Earnshaw gained recognition in the horology world for his role in the creation of the chronometer, a timekeeping instrument used in navigation. He also designed several high-quality watches, which were highly sought after during his lifetime.</p><p>Earnshaw was a member of the Royal Society and received several awards for his work in horology. His legacy continues to live on, as his name has been used to brand a line of luxury watches.</p><p>Earnshaw was largely self-taught in the field of horology and began his career as an apprentice to a watchmaker in Manchester. He later moved to London and established his own workshop, where he began designing and producing watches. </p><p>In 1790, he unveiled his first marine chronometer, which he named the "No. 1." This timepiece quickly gained recognition for its accuracy and reliability, and Earnshaw received orders for his chronometers from the British Admiralty, as well as from notable explorers and navigators, such as Captain James Cook and Captain William Bligh.</p><p>In addition to his work on marine chronometry, Earnshaw made several other significant contributions to the field of horology. He is credited with improving the design of the balance wheel, which is a key component in the regulation of timekeeping in watches.</p><p>Earnshaw also developed a new method for determining precise longitude measurements, which relied on astronomical observations rather than the use of complicated mathematical calculations. This method became known as the "lunar distance method" and was widely adopted by navigators and explorers.</p><p>Earnshaw's legacy as a pioneering watchmaker and inventor of key horological technologies has continued to inspire and influence the field of horology to this day. His name remains synonymous with precision, accuracy, and innovation in timekeeping.</p><p>Earnshaw's innovative work in the field of horology led to his appointment as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1805. He was also awarded the prestigious Copley Medal in 1808, which is the Royal Society's oldest and most prestigious scientific prize. Additionally, Earnshaw's expertise in the field of marine chronometry led to him being appointed as an advisor to the British Admiralty.In 1814, Earnshaw published a book titled "A New and Complete System of Universal Geography," which combined his knowledge of horology and geography. The book included detailed descriptions of his method for determining longitude, as well as other navigational techniques.Upon his death in 1829, Earnshaw's legacy continued to live on through his apprentices and students, who went on to become successful watchmakers and designers in their own right. Today, Earnshaw's name is synonymous with precision timekeeping and his inventions and designs continue to inspire watchmakers and collectors around the world.</p><p></p><p>
