		also known as The Duncan Sisters

	
was
an American
actor and film score composer.



						</p><p>She was born to Jamaican immigrant parents and had four siblings, including Vivian Duncan, with whom she performed as the Duncan Sisters. They appeared in several films together, including "The Wiser Sex" and "It's a Great Life." Rosetta was also a talented song composer, creating the score for the film "The Lucky Horseshoe" in 1941. Despite her success in entertainment, she faced racial discrimination in Hollywood due to her African-American heritage. In the later years of her life, she moved to Chicago and continued to perform in theater productions. However, she passed away at the age of 65 due to complications from a stroke.</p><p>In addition to her work in film and music, Rosetta Duncan was also involved in civil rights activism. She was a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and worked to support the rights of African Americans in the entertainment industry. Her advocacy for equality helped pave the way for future generations of Black performers. In recognition of her contributions to the arts, Duncan was posthumously inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame in 1975. Her legacy continues to inspire and influence those in the entertainment industry today.</p><p>In the early years of her career, Rosetta Duncan and her sister Vivian performed in vaudeville shows across the United States, showcasing their singing, dancing, and comedic talents. They eventually made their way to Broadway, where they received critical acclaim for their performances in musicals such as "Topsy and Eva" and "Scandals." </p><p>Despite the success of their stage performances, the sisters faced challenges when it came to breaking into Hollywood. While their white counterparts were often given leading roles, the Duncan Sisters were offered only supporting parts in films. They were also frequently subjected to racist treatment on set and in public.</p><p>Undeterred, Rosetta continued to pursue her passion for music and writing. In addition to composing film scores, she wrote and recorded her own songs, including "I'll Be Seeing You," which was later popularized by Billie Holiday. She also collaborated with other Black artists of the era, such as Louis Armstrong and Fats Waller.</p><p>Throughout her life, Rosetta Duncan used her platform to advocate for racial justice and equality. She was known for speaking out against discriminatory practices in the entertainment industry and using her art to create positive change. Today, she is remembered for her contributions to both the arts and the civil rights movement.</p><p>In her later years, Rosetta Duncan became more involved in social and political activism. She participated in rallies and marches in support of desegregation and voting rights, and she also worked to raise awareness about issues affecting the Black community, such as police brutality and housing discrimination. Her activism reached a national audience when she appeared on the popular television program "The Ed Sullivan Show" in 1956 to discuss the use of blackface in entertainment and the impact it had on the African American community. Her interview was considered groundbreaking for its time, as few Black performers were given a platform to speak out against racism on national television.</p><p>In addition to her work as an actor and composer, Rosetta Duncan also wrote children's books. Her best-known work is "Little Joe's Christmas," a heartwarming story about a young boy's journey to find the perfect present for his mother. The book, which was self-published in 1941, became a beloved holiday classic and is still enjoyed by families today.</p><p>Overall, Rosetta Duncan's contributions to the arts and civil rights continue to inspire and influence people around the world. She was a talented performer, a dedicated activist, and a trailblazer for Black women in the entertainment industry. Her legacy serves as a reminder of the power of art and activism to create positive change in the world.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/english-actresses-died-in-diabetes-mellitus.html' title='English actresses died in Diabetes mellitus'><strong>English actresses died in Diabetes mellitus</strong> List of the top 1 English actresses who died in Diabetes mellitus</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-1996.html' title='Famous actors died in 1996'><strong>Famous actors died in 1996</strong> List of the top 50 Famous actors who died in 1996</a></li><li><a href='/belgian-actresses-born-in-1947.html' title='Belgian actresses born in 1947'><strong>Belgian actresses born in 1947</strong> List of the top 6 Belgian actresses who were born in 1947</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/finnish-actresses-died-in-2006.html' title='Finnish actresses died in 2006'><strong>Finnish actresses died in 2006</strong> List of the top 2 Finnish actresses who died in 2006</a></li><li><a href='/russian-actresses-born-in-1940.html' title='Russian actresses born in 1940'><strong>Russian actresses born in 1940</strong> List of the top 7 Russian actresses who were born in 1940</a></li><li><a href='/german-actors-died-in-traffic-collision.html' title='German actors died in Traffic collision'><strong>German actors died in Traffic collision</strong> List of the top 2 German actors who died in Traffic collision</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
