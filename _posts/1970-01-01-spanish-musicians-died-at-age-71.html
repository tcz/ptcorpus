(October 6, 1916-April 5, 1988)


was
a Spanish
writer.


					</p><p>He was also a literary critic and essayist. Calvo Serer was born in Valencia, Spain and studied philosophy and literature at the University of Madrid. He became a professor of literature and held various academic appointments throughout his career. Calvo Serer was a major figure in the literary and cultural scene of Spain during the mid-20th century. He was a co-founder and editor of the literary magazine Papeles de Son Armadans, which published the works of many prominent writers and intellectuals. In addition to his literary work, Calvo Serer was also an outspoken defender of democracy and human rights in Spain. He was a member of the Spanish Parliament and served as Minister of Education and Culture in the early 1970s. Calvo Serer's writings and activism helped pave the way for the transition to democracy following the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975.</p><p>Throughout his career, Rafael Calvo Serer was a prolific writer and his work covered various topics including literature, art, politics, and society. He wrote several acclaimed books, including "The Spanish Bourgeois Novel" (1955) and "The Myth of the Spanish Character" (1958). In "The Spanish Bourgeois Novel", Calvo Serer analyzed the literary movement that emerged in Spain in the early 20th century and its relationship with the country's social and political context. "The Myth of the Spanish Character" examined the various stereotypes and myths that had been constructed about Spain and its people over the centuries.</p><p>In addition to his literary and academic pursuits, Calvo Serer was also active in politics. He was a member of the Spanish Socialist Party, and in the 1970s he served as the Minister of Education and Culture in the government of Adolfo Suárez. In this role, he was instrumental in introducing sweeping reforms in the education system and promoting cultural activities throughout the country. After Franco's death, Calvo Serer continued to be involved in politics and was a member of the committee responsible for drafting the Spanish Constitution of 1978.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Rafael Calvo Serer's legacy is complicated by his involvement with Franco's regime early in his career. In the 1940s and 1950s, he wrote several articles in support of the regime's cultural policies and was even awarded a prize by Franco himself. However, as he became increasingly disillusioned with the regime's repressive tactics and lack of democracy, Calvo Serer's political views evolved, and he became a vocal advocate for reform and democracy. Today, he is remembered as an important figure in Spanish literature and culture, as well as a key player in Spain's transition to democracy.</p><p></p><p>
