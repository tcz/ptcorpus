During her fourth pregnancy in 1961, Gianna was diagnosed with a tumor on her uterus. Her doctors recommended an abortion in order to save her life, but Gianna refused. She chose to have the tumor removed while still pregnant, knowing that it would put her life at risk.

However, complications arose and Gianna died one week later at the age of 39.</p><p>Gianna Beretta Molla was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1994 and was canonized by Pope John Paul II in 2004.

(April 5, 1497		Lamporecchio-May 26, 1536			Florence)


was
an Italian
writer.


					</p><p>He is known for his contribution to the literary genre of the "Capitoli," a type of comic poem in which he criticized the social and political conditions of his time. Berni was influenced by the works of classical poets such as Virgil and Ovid, as well as contemporary writers like Ludovico Ariosto. He also played a significant role in the development of the Italian language by promoting the use of vernacular and colloquial expressions in literature. Berni was appointed as a court poet by the Duke of Florence, Alessandro de' Medici, and had a significant impact on the city's cultural scene. His works continue to be studied and celebrated in Italy and around the world.</p><p>In addition to his written works, Francesco Berni was also known for his wit and humor. He was a member of the Accademia degli Intronati, a literary group in Siena, where he participated in debates and discussions on various topics. Berni's literary style and humor are often compared to that of Fran√ßois Rabelais, a French writer who also used satire and wit to criticize the social and political norms of his time.</p><p>Berni's most famous works include "Capitolo del Forno," "Capitolo del Gioco della Primiera," and "Capitolo dell'Invidia," which are still studied in Italian literature and history courses today. He was also a translator and worked on translating the works of the Roman poet Catullus.</p><p>Despite his success as a writer and court poet, Berni lived a troubled life. He struggled with alcoholism and financial difficulties, often depending on the support of friends and patrons. He died at the age of 39, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire writers and artists to this day.</p><p>Berni was born into a noble family and received a humanistic education in Florence. He began his literary career by writing Latin and Italian poems, but it was his development of the "Capitoli" that brought him fame. These humorous poems used colloquial language and dialects, making them accessible to a wider audience. His satirical criticisms of the societal and political issues of his time, including corruption and greed, gained him popularity among the people of Tuscany.</p><p>Later in his career, Berni became a prominent translator, working on translating works from Latin into Italian. He also began to write prose, including a notable work of literary criticism titled "The Apology of Francesco Berni". This work defended the use of colloquial language in literature and argued for the importance of humor in writing.</p><p>Berni's influence on Italian literature continued long after his death. His works were highly regarded by the Italian poets of the 16th century and beyond, including Torquato Tasso who referred to Berni as the "father of the burlesque". His style also influenced a new generation of writers in the 19th century, known as the "neo-Berneschi", who revived the use of the "Capitoli".</p><p>Despite his struggles, Francesco Berni remains a key figure in the development of Italian literature and language. His dedication to incorporating humor and vernacular language into his works left a lasting impact on Italian culture.</p><p></p><p>
