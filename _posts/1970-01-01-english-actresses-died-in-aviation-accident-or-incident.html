							Elsie Mackay was the daughter of Scottish industrialist and politician James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape. She became involved in the entertainment industry in the early 1900s, appearing in stage productions and silent films. Despite her success in those fields, Mackay's true passion was aviation. In 1927, she became the first British woman to receive a pilot's license from the National Private Pilots' License. Mackayâ€™s aviation skills quickly garnered her public attention and she set records for altitude and distance flown by a woman.</p><p>Mackay's interest in aviation led her to fund and co-pilot an attempt to fly across the Atlantic Ocean with pilot Captain H. H. Railey in March of 1928. The attempt was ill-fated, and their plane, a Stinson Detroiter named "Endeavour", disappeared over the ocean, likely due to mechanical failure. The search for the missing craft, one of the largest ever conducted up to that point, was unsuccessful, and Mackay was presumed dead.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=17637433" title="Wikipedia article about Elsie Mackay">Elsie Mackay on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/filipino-musicians-died-at-age-65.html' title='Filipino musicians died at age 65'><strong>Filipino musicians died at age 65</strong> List of the top 17 Filipino music stars who died when they were 65</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-rheumatoid-arthritis.html' title='Famous actors died in Rheumatoid arthritis'><strong>Famous actors died in Rheumatoid arthritis</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actors who died in Rheumatoid arthritis</a></li><li><a href='/english-actresses-born-in-1942.html' title='English actresses born in 1942'><strong>English actresses born in 1942</strong> List of the top 12 English actresses who were born in 1942</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/irish-actresses-died-before-turning-18.html' title='Irish actresses died before turning 18'><strong>Irish actresses died before turning 18</strong> List of the top 2 Irish actresses who died before they turned 18</a></li><li><a href='/australian-actresses-died-in-2002.html' title='Australian actresses died in 2002'><strong>Australian actresses died in 2002</strong> List of the top 3 Australian actresses who died in 2002</a></li><li><a href='/polish-actresses-died-in-1980.html' title='Polish actresses died in 1980'><strong>Polish actresses died in 1980</strong> List of the top 1 Polish actresses who died in 1980</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
