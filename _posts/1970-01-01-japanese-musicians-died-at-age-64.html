was
a Japanese
writer.


					</p><p>He was a major influence on the naturalist movement in Japanese literature, which was characterized by its frank portrayal of real life and its struggles. Inoue's most famous work is the novel "The Hunting Gun," which tells the story of a love triangle between a father and his two daughters. The novel was praised for its nuanced characterizations and its unflinching look at human emotions. In addition to his literary work, Inoue was also involved in social and political activism, advocating for worker's rights and participating in the women's suffrage movement.</p><p>He studied English literature at Tokyo Imperial University but left before earning a degree. He began his writing career as a journalist, but his focus gradually shifted to fiction. Inoue was a prolific writer and produced a wide variety of works, including short stories, novellas, and novels, which often explored the complexities of human relationships.</p><p>Inoue's writing style was characterized by its realism and attention to detail, and his work often highlighted the struggles of ordinary people trying to find meaning in their lives. In addition to "The Hunting Gun," some of his other notable works include "The Bullfight," "The Counterfeiter," and "The Flood."</p><p>Throughout his life, Inoue was deeply committed to social justice and activism. He was a member of several left-wing organizations and advocated for the rights of marginalized groups. He also supported the movement for Korean independence and was an early advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in Japan.</p><p>Today, Inoue is widely regarded as one of Japan's most important modern writers, and his work continues to be read and studied both in Japan and around the world.</p><p>Inoue Kenkabō was born into a samurai family in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, and was the youngest of ten siblings. His family was impoverished, and Inoue had to work as a tutor to support himself through university. After leaving university without graduating, Inoue took a job as a journalist for a Tokyo newspaper, where he began to develop his writing style.</p><p>Inoue's writing career took off in the 1910s and 1920s, a period of great social and cultural upheaval in Japan. He was associated with the Shirakaba (White Birch) literary group, which included other prominent writers such as Mushanokōji Saneatsu and Shiga Naoya. The group was known for its emphasis on literary experimentation and its willingness to challenge traditional Japanese literary forms.</p><p>In addition to his literary work, Inoue was a political activist who supported progressive causes such as workers' rights, women's suffrage, and Korean independence. He was a member of the Japan Communist Party, and his political views were reflected in his writing, which often highlighted social injustice and inequality.</p><p>Inoue's legacy as a writer has been widely recognized in Japan and around the world. In 1949, he was posthumously awarded the Order of Culture by the Japanese government, and his works have been the subject of numerous translations and critical studies. Today, he is remembered as a key figure in the development of modern Japanese literature and as a champion of social justice and human rights.</p><p>Inoue's personal life was marked by tragedy and heartbreak. He lost his wife and two children to illness before the age of 30, which had a profound impact on his writing. Inoue's own health was also poor, and he suffered from tuberculosis for much of his adult life. Despite his health struggles, he remained committed to his activism and continued writing until his death in 1934 at the age of 64.</p><p>In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Inoue's life and work, particularly among younger generations. His writing, which remains poignant and relevant today, has been embraced by readers outside Japan as well, with translations of his works now available in numerous languages. Inoue's life and work continue to inspire new generations of writers and social activists, making him a true icon of Japanese literature and culture.</p><p></p><p>

(May 15, 1933		Ukyō-ku, Kyoto-December 20, 1997			Azabudai, Minato, Tokyo)

	
		a.k.a. Itami Juzo, Ikeuchi Yoshihiro, Ichizô Itami, Itami Ichizô, Yoshihiro Ikeuchi, Jûzô Itami, Ichizo Atami, Ichizo Itami or Itami Jūzō

	
was
a Japanese
film director, actor, screenwriter and film producer.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Mansaku Ikeuchi and Ikeuchi Mampei.

						</p><p>Juzo Itami was born as Yoshihiro Ikeuchi into a prominent Kyoto family. After graduating from the Hitotsubashi University, he started his career as an actor, mainly appearing in films directed by his father, Mansaku Ikeuchi. He changed his name to Juzo Itami when he started his career as a film director in 1982, with the release of "The Funeral". </p><p>Itami's films are known for their satirical and humorous take on Japanese society and culture, and often touch upon taboos and controversial subjects. His most popular film, "Tampopo" (1985), is a quirky comedy about the search for the perfect bowl of ramen, and has since become a cult classic. </p><p>In addition to his film work, Itami also wrote several books, including a memoir titled "Osôshiki" (The Funeral), which details his experiences during the making of his debut film. </p><p>Tragically, on December 20, 1997, Itami committed suicide by jumping from the roof of his office in Tokyo. Though the exact reason for his suicide remains unknown, some speculate that it was related to the controversy surrounding his last film, "Minbo no Onna" (1992), which exposed the extortion and violence perpetrated by yakuza gangs in business community.</p><p>Beyond his work as a director, screenwriter, and author, Juzo Itami was also an accomplished actor, having appeared in over 50 films throughout his career. He often played roles in his own films, such as in "Tampopo" and "A Taxing Woman", which won him the Best Actor award at the Japanese Academy Awards in 1988. In addition to his film work, Itami was also involved in the theater and television industries. He co-founded the theatrical group Tokyo Seinendan in 1970, which produced several of his early works. He also hosted a popular television talk show called "Itami Juzo no Kenkyu-roku" (Juzo Itami's Research Records), in which he explored various aspects of Japanese culture and society. Despite its controversial subject matter, "Minbo no Onna" was a critical and commercial success, winning several awards both domestically and internationally. In the wake of Itami's death, the film industry mourned the loss of one of its most innovative and talented directors.</p><p>Despite Itami's much-celebrated career, his death left behind a cloud of mystery and speculation. The most prevalent theory behind his suicide was that it was the result of a violent assault by the Yakuza. Reports suggest that Itami was kidnapped, beaten, and sexually assaulted as retaliation for his frank depiction of the Yakuza in "Minbo no Onna". Though Itami initially filed a police report, he later withdrew it, saying that he did not want to be a burden to society. In the end, it is unclear what truly led Itami to take his own life, but his contributions to Japanese cinema and culture remain highly esteemed. Today, he is remembered as one of the most influential filmmakers in Japanese history, and his films continue to resonate with audiences around the world.</p><p>In addition to his artistic career, Juzo Itami was also involved in politics. He ran as an independent candidate for governor of Tokyo in 1988, with a campaign focused on cleaning up government corruption and improving the lives of Tokyo residents. Though he placed fourth in the election, his campaign was widely covered in the media and helped to raise awareness of political issues among Japanese voters. Itami's political involvement reflected his deep commitment to using his art and public influence to effect positive change in society. Despite his untimely death, his legacy as a filmmaker, writer, actor, and political activist continues to inspire new generations of Japanese artists and thinkers.</p><p></p><p>

(December 22, 1882		Okayama-April 26, 1947			Nanjing)


was
a Japanese
personality.


					</p><p>He was a diplomat and a Lieutenant General in the Imperial Japanese Army. Tani served as the Japanese consul-general in Tianjin, China from 1935 to 1937. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he was appointed to serve as the commander of the Japanese 6th Division in Nanjing, China. He was responsible for the capture and occupation of Nanjing in 1937, which became known as the Nanjing Massacre. Tani was held responsible for the atrocities committed by his troops during the occupation and was later tried as a war criminal by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but died of illness while in prison in 1947.</p><p>Prior to his military and diplomatic career, Hisao Tani studied at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and served in the Japanese forces during the Russo-Japanese War. He also attended the Japanese Army War College and later worked as an instructor at the academy. In addition to his military and diplomatic roles, Tani was also known for his expertise in calligraphy and art, and was a member of various art associations in Japan. His role in the Nanjing Massacre has remained controversial over the years, with some historians arguing that he was directly involved in the atrocities, while others have suggested that he may have tried to prevent or limit them. Regardless, the events in Nanjing during his command remain one of the most brutal episodes of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and continue to impact relations between China and Japan today.</p><p>During his time as consul-general in Tianjin, Tani worked to expand Japanese influence in northern China, and was an advocate for Japanese expansionism in the region. He also played a role in the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. </p><p>After the capture of Nanjing, Tani continued to serve in the Imperial Japanese Army during the war, and was eventually promoted to the rank of General. His trial as a war criminal focused on his responsibility for the atrocities committed by his troops during the occupation of Nanjing, including rape, murder, and looting. Despite the controversy surrounding his actions, Tani's trial and imprisonment helped to establish the principle that military leaders could be held accountable for war crimes, and paved the way for future war crimes tribunals.</p><p>In addition to his military and artistic pursuits, Tani was also a devout Buddhist and was known for his philanthropic work. However, his legacy has been overshadowed by his role in the Nanjing Massacre, which remains a source of tension between Japan and China to this day.</p><p>Tani's family background was rooted in the samurai class, and his grandfather served as a retainer for the Okayama Domain. Tani himself was known for his strict adherence to traditional Japanese values and cultural practices, and his passion for calligraphy and art reflected this. He was particularly interested in Chinese-style calligraphy, and his work often combined elements from both Japanese and Chinese styles.</p><p>Despite his military and diplomatic careers, Tani remained interested in art throughout his life, and was a member of several art associations in Japan. He also served as a patron for several artists, and his collection of calligraphy and art was well-respected in artistic circles. Tani's interest in culture and the arts may have contributed to his interest in Chinese affairs, as China was seen as a major cultural influence on Japan at the time.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Tani has been the subject of several books and documentaries over the years. Some of these works have sought to provide a more nuanced view of his actions during the Nanjing Massacre, while others have condemned him as a war criminal. Regardless of one's view of him, Tani's life and career are a testament to the complex and often fraught relationship between Japan and China during the first half of the 20th century.</p><p></p><p>
