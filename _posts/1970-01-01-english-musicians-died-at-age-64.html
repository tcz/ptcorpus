(April 5, 1097		Huntingdon-April 5, 1161)


was
an English
personality.


					</p><p>She was a medieval Christian mystic, visionary, and anchoress who lived in the 12th century. Christina was born into a noble family, but at the age of 14, she fled a betrothal and decided to dedicate her life to religion. She became an anchoress, a type of female hermit who was walled up in a small cell attached to a church, and dedicated herself to a life of prayer, contemplation, and spiritual guidance. Christina's holiness and reputation for miracles attracted many followers, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, who sought her counsel. She also became a patron of the arts, commissioning illuminated manuscripts and music. Her life story was recorded in the "Life of Christina of Markyate", a hagiography that became popular in the Middle Ages. Christina is recognized as a saint by some Christian denominations.</p><p>Christina of Markyate also had a significant political impact during her time. She was involved in several disputes with local landowners and the church over the ownership of the land and properties around the town of Markyate. Christina successfully defended the rights of the church and the poor, and her efforts contributed to the establishment of a self-governing parish, making her one of the earliest recorded female activists in England. She also provided refuge and protection for women who sought shelter from abusive husbands or oppressive social conditions by setting up a religious community. Christina's legacy remains an inspiration and a reminder of the powerful influence that individuals, even those who choose an isolated life of prayer, can have on their community and society.</p><p></p><p>
