Åberg directed numerous productions at the Södermalmsteatern, and helped launch the careers of several young actors and playwrights. In addition to his contributions to Swedish culture, Åberg was also known for his philanthropy. He was a generous supporter of various charities, including organizations that provided aid to struggling artists and their families. Åberg passed away in 1952 at the age of 70, but his legacy lives on through his contributions to Swedish culture and his charitable work.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/filipino-actors-died-at-age-49.html' title='Filipino actors died at age 49'><strong>Filipino actors died at age 49</strong> List of the top 1 Filipino actors who died when they were 49</a></li><li><a href='/french-actors-died-in-bowel-obstruction.html' title='French actors died in Bowel obstruction'><strong>French actors died in Bowel obstruction</strong> List of the top 1 French actors who died in Bowel obstruction</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-actors-died-at-age-24.html' title='Canadian actors died at age 24'><strong>Canadian actors died at age 24</strong> List of the top 1 Canadian actors who died when they were 24</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-cirrhosis.html' title='Famous musicians died in Cirrhosis'><strong>Famous musicians died in Cirrhosis</strong> List of the top 28 Famous music stars who died in Cirrhosis</a></li><li><a href='/colombian-musicians-died-at-age-50.html' title='Colombian musicians died at age 50'><strong>Colombian musicians died at age 50</strong> List of the top 2 Colombian music stars who died when they were 50</a></li><li><a href='/brazilian-actors-born-in-1928.html' title='Brazilian actors born in 1928'><strong>Brazilian actors born in 1928</strong> List of the top 9 Brazilian actors who were born in 1928</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
