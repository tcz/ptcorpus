									</h1><p>Here are 2 famous musicians from United States of America died in Hypertension:</p><h2>Booker T. Washington</h2><p><strong>Booker T. Washington</strong>
(April 5, 1856		Hale&#039;s Ford-November 14, 1915			Tuskegee)

	
		a.k.a. Booker Washington

	
was
an American
writer, educator and author.


					</p><p>Washington was born a slave in Virginia and went on to become one of the most prominent African American leaders of his time. He was the founder of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, which was a vocational school for black students, helping them to gain knowledge and skills for economic advancement. Washington was also known for his philosophy of gradualism and accommodation, which meant that he believed in working with white people rather than against them to achieve greater political and economic rights for African Americans. Despite criticism from some within the black community, Washington was able to make significant gains for his people during his lifetime, including influencing the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt and negotiating with wealthy donors to fund the Tuskegee Institute. He remains a key figure in American history and has inspired many other civil rights leaders who followed in his wake.</p><p>Washington's philosophy of gradualism and accommodation was controversial within the black community during his time. His approach to racial advancement often put him at odds with other prominent black leaders of his day, such as W.E.B. Du Bois, who criticized Washington's willingness to compromise with white supremacists. Despite the backlash, Washington continued to advocate for education and economic prosperity for African Americans, believing that it was the best way to combat racial injustice.</p><p>Washington's efforts were not limited to education, however. He was also involved in politics and advised multiple presidents, including Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, on matters related to race and civil rights. He also founded the National Negro Business League in 1900, which aimed to promote black-owned businesses and provide resources for aspiring entrepreneurs.</p><p>Washington's legacy has been complicated by his accommodationist philosophy, but his contributions to black education and economic progress cannot be denied. Many institutions, including Tuskegee University, continue to honor his memory and build upon the work he started over a century ago.</p><p></p><p>
