In 1869, while studying white blood cells, Miescher discovered a previously unknown substance inside the nuclei of the cells, which he called nuclein. He later extracted this substance and discovered that it was rich in phosphorus and nitrogen. This marked the first discovery of what we now know as DNA. Miescher also made significant contributions to other areas of biochemistry, including the study of proteins and enzymes. Despite being largely overlooked during his lifetime, Miescher's discoveries paved the way for some of the most important breakthroughs in biology and medicine.</p><p></p><p>
