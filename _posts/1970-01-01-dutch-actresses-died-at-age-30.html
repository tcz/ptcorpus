							Talitha Getty was born in the former Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) to a Dutch father and a British mother. Her family emigrated to England when she was a child, where she later attended a prestigious boarding school. In the 1960s, she became a fashion icon and model, known for her bohemian style and frequent appearances in fashion magazines. She also pursued an acting career, appearing in films such as "Barbarella" and "A Simple Story". </p><p>In 1966, Talitha met and married oil heir and art collector John Paul Getty Jr. The couple became renowned for their extravagant lifestyle and jet-setting ways, often entertaining the likes of Mick Jagger and Andy Warhol at their Moroccan villa. However, their marriage was plagued by drug addiction and infidelity, leading to a separation in 1971. </p><p>Tragically, Talitha Getty died later that year at the age of 30 from a heroin overdose in her Rome apartment. Her death shocked the fashion and entertainment world, and she has since become a cultural icon and symbol of the hedonism and excess of the 1960s.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=5634629" title="Wikipedia article about Talitha Getty">Talitha Getty on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actresses-died-in-heart-failure.html' title='American actresses died in Heart failure'><strong>American actresses died in Heart failure</strong> List of the top 50 American actresses who died in Heart failure</a></li><li><a href='/czechoslovakian-actresses-died-in-2000.html' title='Czechoslovakian actresses died in 2000'><strong>Czechoslovakian actresses died in 2000</strong> List of the top 1 Czechoslovakian actresses who died in 2000</a></li><li><a href='/bangladeshi-musicians-died-at-age-32.html' title='Bangladeshi musicians died at age 32'><strong>Bangladeshi musicians died at age 32</strong> List of the top 2 Bangladeshi music stars who died when they were 32</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/czech-actors-died-in-cancer.html' title='Czech actors died in Cancer'><strong>Czech actors died in Cancer</strong> List of the top 3 Czech actors who died in Cancer</a></li><li><a href='/filipino-musicians-died-at-age-22.html' title='Filipino musicians died at age 22'><strong>Filipino musicians died at age 22</strong> List of the top 2 Filipino music stars who died when they were 22</a></li><li><a href='/egyptian-actors-died-at-age-77.html' title='Egyptian actors died at age 77'><strong>Egyptian actors died at age 77</strong> List of the top 1 Egyptian actors who died when they were 77</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
