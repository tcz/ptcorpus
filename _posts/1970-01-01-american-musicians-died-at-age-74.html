He also played a key role in securing Chicago as the site of the 1968 Democratic National Convention, an event that was marked by violent clashes between protesters and police.</p><p>Daley was a Democrat, and he was known for his influence within the party at the national level. He was a key supporter of John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, and he is credited with playing a role in securing Kennedy's victory in Illinois, which was a crucial battleground state at the time.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Daley is widely regarded as one of the most important politicians in the history of Chicago, and his impact on the city can still be felt today.</p><p>Daley's political career began in 1936 when he was first elected to the Illinois House of Representatives.
