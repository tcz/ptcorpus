He also wrote plays, essays, and children's literature. Setúbal was a participant in the 1922 Modernist movement, which aimed to break away from traditional styles of Brazilian literature. He was friends with prominent Modernists, such as Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade.

He was one of the first writers to incorporate the language and culture of rural areas and small towns into his works. This style of writing would become known as the regionalist literary movement and would feature prominently in Brazilian literature in the following decades. Setúbal's works were also known for their social commentary, which was particularly relevant during the early 20th century when Brazil was undergoing significant political and social changes. Additionally, Setúbal's children's books, such as "Histórias do Tio Barnabé," were popular for their use of folktales and local legends. In honor of his contributions to Brazilian literature, the Paulo Setúbal House of Culture was established in his hometown of Tatuí, which now houses a museum featuring his personal and literary belongings.</p><p></p><p>
