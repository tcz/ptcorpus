		a.k.a. Andrew Cobb

	
was
a Canadian
architect.


					</p><p>He is known for his contribution to the architecture of Canada, specifically for designing buildings in the Canadian Maritimes region.

He was also responsible for the design of many important municipal and educational buildings including the Saint John Law Courts and the University of New Brunswick.</p><p>Cobb's architectural style drew from a variety of influences, including the Arts and Crafts movement, which he had come into contact with while in Europe in 1903. His buildings were known for their attention to detail and craftsmanship, and his commitment to using local materials and designs meant that his work often blended seamlessly into the landscape.</p><p>Cobb was a co-founder of the Architects' Association of New Brunswick and served as the organization's first president. He was also a founding member of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, and remained active in both organizations throughout his career. He passed away in 1943, leaving behind an impressive body of work that continues to inspire architects in Canada and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
