(June 13, 1876		Brooklyn-June 2, 1943)

	
		a.k.a. Andrew Cobb

	
was
a Canadian
architect.


					</p><p>He is known for his contribution to the architecture of Canada, specifically for designing buildings in the Canadian Maritimes region. After receiving his education in architecture from the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, Cobb moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where he established his architectural practice. </p><p>Cobb designed several notable buildings in the region including the landmark Fairmont Algonquin Hotel and the famous "Fishing Village" architecture in St. Andrews, New Brunswick. He was also responsible for the design of many important municipal and educational buildings including the Saint John Law Courts and the University of New Brunswick.</p><p>Cobb's architectural style drew from a variety of influences, including the Arts and Crafts movement, which he had come into contact with while in Europe in 1903. His buildings were known for their attention to detail and craftsmanship, and his commitment to using local materials and designs meant that his work often blended seamlessly into the landscape.</p><p>Cobb was a co-founder of the Architects' Association of New Brunswick and served as the organization's first president. He was also a founding member of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, and remained active in both organizations throughout his career. He passed away in 1943, leaving behind an impressive body of work that continues to inspire architects in Canada and beyond.</p><p>In addition to his work in the Maritimes, Andrew Cobb also made significant contributions to the architecture of Newfoundland and Labrador. He designed several buildings in St. John's, including the Colonial Building, which served as the seat of government for the former Colony of Newfoundland. Cobb's work on the Colonial Building is noteworthy because it was one of the first public buildings in the country to be constructed using reinforced concrete, a new building material at the time.</p><p>Cobb was also involved in the restoration of historic buildings in the region, including the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in St. John's, which was damaged by fire in 1892. His work on the restoration of the cathedral earned him a reputation as an expert in restoration and conservation, and he was called upon to consult on similar projects throughout his career.</p><p>Beyond his architectural accomplishments, Cobb was also an accomplished painter and writer. He was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and his paintings were exhibited at several galleries throughout Canada. He also wrote extensively on the subject of architecture and was a regular contributor to architecture journals in Canada and the United States.</p><p>Today, Andrew Cobb is remembered as one of Canada's most important architects, and his work continues to be celebrated by architects and historians alike.</p><p>Cobb's legacy extends beyond his architectural work, as well. He was a passionate advocate for the preservation of historic buildings and sites, and he played a key role in the establishment of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. He also served as the first chairman of the New Brunswick Historic Sites Advisory Board, and was instrumental in the preservation of several historic sites in the province, including Fort Beauséjour, Carleton Martello Tower, and Kings Landing Historical Settlement.Cobb's commitment to preserving Canada's architectural heritage and promoting the use of local materials and designs continues to influence architects and preservationists today. His work is studied and celebrated as an important part of Canadian architectural history, and his ideas and innovations continue to inspire new generations of architects and designers.</p><p>In addition to his architectural and artistic talents, Andrew Cobb was also a dedicated family man. He was married to Mary Fowler from 1907 until her death in 1937, and the couple had three children together. He also had a deep appreciation for nature and the outdoors, often incorporating natural elements into his designs. This connection to nature is evident in several of his buildings, including the Fairmont Algonquin Hotel which is nestled among the trees in St. Andrews.Cobb's influence can still be seen in the architecture of the Maritimes, with many of his buildings still standing and in use today, including several that have been designated as National Historic Sites of Canada. His commitment to incorporating local materials and designs into his work has also had a lasting impact on the architecture of the region, with many contemporary architects continuing to draw inspiration from his legacy.</p><p></p><p>

(March 12, 1795		Dundee-August 28, 1861			Toronto)


was
a Canadian
journalist and politician.


					</p><p>He played a huge role in Canadian politics during the mid-19th century, being one of the most vocal advocates for democracy and responsible government. He is best known for his leading role in the failed Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837, which sought to overthrow the ruling British colonial government and establish an independent republic. After fleeing to the United States, Mackenzie continued to agitate for Canadian independence and was eventually pardoned in 1849, allowing him to return to Canada. He served briefly as Mayor of Toronto in 1851, and later as a Member of Parliament in the Canadian legislature. He also founded a newspaper, the Colonial Advocate, which became an important voice for political and social reform in Canada. Despite his controversial past, Mackenzie is widely regarded as an important figure in Canadian history, and his legacy continues to inspire political activism and social change.</p><p>Mackenzie was born in Scotland and immigrated to Canada in 1820, where he quickly became involved in politics and journalism. He was a strong advocate for the rights of the working class and frequently criticized the ruling elite for their corrupt practices. Mackenzie's newspaper, the Colonial Advocate, gained a large following and helped galvanize support for his political views. </p><p>Following the failure of the Upper Canada Rebellion, Mackenzie remained active in politics, advocating for reform and greater democracy in Canada. He played a key role in the movement towards responsible government, which eventually led to Canada becoming a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. </p><p>In addition to his political and journalistic pursuits, Mackenzie was also a successful businessman, owning a number of mills and factories in Toronto. He was a strong supporter of the temperance movement and played an important role in establishing the Toronto General Hospital. </p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Mackenzie was also a controversial figure, and his actions during the Rebellion continue to be a source of debate among historians. Nevertheless, his dedication to democracy and social justice have had a lasting impact on Canadian society, and he remains an important symbol of Canadian nationalism and political reform.</p><p>Mackenzie's involvement in the Rebellion began after years of frustration with the ruling government's corruption and lack of concern for the welfare of the common people. He organized a group of rebels to take up arms against the British authorities, but the rebellion was quickly put down in a series of skirmishes. Mackenzie fled to the United States and sought support for a renewed rebellion, but his efforts were largely unsuccessful. He was eventually granted amnesty and returned to Canada, where he resumed his political activism.</p><p>As Mayor of Toronto, Mackenzie worked to improve the city's infrastructure and public services, including the establishment of a fire department and the widening of city streets. He was also responsible for the construction of the first building for the University of Toronto.</p><p>In his later years, Mackenzie continued to advocate for social and political reform, particularly in the areas of universal suffrage and workers' rights. He passed away in 1861, just as Canada was on the brink of a period of tremendous change and progress.</p><p>Mackenzie's legacy as a champion of democracy and social justice is still felt in Canadian society today. His contributions to the movement towards responsible government and the establishment of Canada as a nation have secured his place in the country's history as a founding father and ardent patriot.</p><p>In addition to his extensive political and journalistic work, Mackenzie was also a celebrated author and linguist. He was fluent in several languages, including French, Spanish, and German, and wrote extensively on a variety of topics ranging from politics and history to linguistics and literature. He was also a prominent member of Toronto's literary community and founded the Toronto Literary and Scientific Society, which helped promote the arts and sciences in the city. Mackenzie's contributions to Canadian literature were recognized with his induction into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2010. Overall, his intellectual curiosity and passion for knowledge were integral parts of his life's work and legacy.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Abraham Gesner

	
was
a Canadian
physician and geologist.


					</p><p>Notably, Abraham Gesner is credited with the discovery of kerosene, a popular source of fuel during the 19th century. He invented a process to refine petroleum into kerosene which he called "kerosene oil" and received a patent for it in 1854. His invention revolutionized the lighting industry and became a cheaper alternative to whale oil that was previously used for lamps. In addition to his work with petroleum, Gesner contributed significantly to the fields of geology and paleontology, and was a founding member of both the Natural History Society of New Brunswick and the Nova Scotia Institute of Natural Science. He also served as the provincial geologist of New Brunswick from 1838 to 1842.</p><p>Before his scientific pursuits, Gesner had a successful medical career. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in medicine in 1820 and practiced medicine in New Brunswick for a few years. However, his interest in geology and natural science led him to pursue a new career path.</p><p>Apart from his scientific achievements, Gesner was also a prolific writer. He authored several books on geology and natural science including "New Brunswick: with Notes for Emigrants" and "Industrial Resources of Nova Scotia". In addition to his scientific writings, he also penned a novel called "The Canadian Brothers" which gained immense popularity and was adapted into a stage play.</p><p>Gesner's contribution to the field of petroleum refining and the lighting industry continues to influence modern technology. He is remembered as a pioneering figure in the history of Canada's scientific development.</p><p>Gesner's legacy is celebrated in several ways in Canada. The Gesner Medal, awarded by the Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, is named after him. The medal recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to the field of petroleum geology. Additionally, the Government of Canada designated Gesner a National Historic Person in 2016. </p><p>Despite his significant achievements, Gesner faced financial struggles throughout his life. He invested heavily in his kerosene refining process, which resulted in him going bankrupt several times. Gesner also faced challenges in securing funding for his scientific research, as he often had to rely on his own funds to conduct experiments and publish his findings. </p><p>Gesner's impact was not limited to Canada. His invention of kerosene sparked a global transformation in the lighting industry, leading to greater energy efficiency and accessibility. Today, kerosene is still widely used as a fuel source for heating and transportation, particularly in developing countries. </p><p>Overall, Gesner's contributions to science, literature, and industry continue to be recognized and celebrated. His work laid the foundation for further advancements in the fields of petroleum refining, geology, and natural science.</p><p>Gesner's legacy also includes his role in the development of the Canadian railway system. He served as the chief geologist of the European and North American Railway, which aimed to connect Halifax and Quebec City via the province of New Brunswick. Gesner conducted geological surveys and provided advice on the construction of the railway, which was seen as a significant infrastructure project at the time. The railway helped to facilitate trade and commerce between the Maritime provinces and central Canada, and played a key role in the development of the Canadian economy.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and literary accomplishments, Gesner was also a community leader and social activist. He was a prominent member of the Universalist Church in Halifax, and advocated for social justice and equality. Gesner was a vocal supporter of the abolition of slavery and the temperance movement, and worked to promote education and literacy in his community.</p><p>Gesner's contributions to science and society have been recognized through various honours and awards. In addition to the Gesner Medal, there are several parks, streets, and other landmarks named after him in Canada. The University of New Brunswick, where Gesner taught geology and natural history, also established the Gesner Award in his honour, which recognizes outstanding contributions to the fields of science and engineering.</p><p>Despite facing many obstacles in his life, Gesner persevered in his pursuit of scientific knowledge and innovation. His discoveries and inventions have had a lasting impact on society and continue to be studied and celebrated to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(October 1, 1942-September 24, 2009)


was
a Canadian
psychologist.


					</p><p>Along with her husband, Martin Daly, she co-authored many influential papers on the evolution of human behavior, particularly in regards to the concept of "parental investment." She was a professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, where she also served as director of the Institute for Applied Cognitive Science. Wilson and Daly were the recipients of multiple awards for their research, including the Darwin-Wallace Medal from the Linnean Society of London. Wilson was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Despite her untimely death at the age of 66, her contributions to the field of psychology continue to be highly respected and influential.</p><p>Wilson was born and raised in Canada and completed her undergraduate studies in psychology at the University of Toronto. She earned her PhD from the University of Michigan, where she met her husband and collaborator, Martin Daly. Together, they developed the theory of "parental investment," which suggests that parents invest more in their biological offspring than in non-biological offspring due to the evolutionary advantage of passing on their genes to the next generation. This theory has had a significant impact on the study of human behavior and has been applied to fields such as child development, criminology, and economics.</p><p>Throughout her career, Wilson was known for her dedication to research and her advocacy for evidence-based approaches to understanding human behavior. She was an active member of the scientific community, serving as editor for several journals and participating in numerous professional organizations. She also enjoyed teaching and mentoring students, many of whom have gone on to successful careers in psychology and related fields.</p><p>In addition to her academic achievements, Wilson was also an accomplished musician and photographer. She was a passionate supporter of the arts, and often incorporated creative pursuits into her research and teaching. Her legacy continues to inspire students and scholars around the world, and her impact on the field of psychology is widely recognized and celebrated.</p><p>Wilson's research went beyond the evolutionary aspect of human behavior and also explored the impact of the environment on development. She was a vocal critic of the "nature vs. nurture" debate and instead advocated for a more nuanced understanding that recognized the complex interactions between biology and environment. Her work on the effects of poverty and social inequality on child development was particularly influential, and she was a strong advocate for policies that helped to support disadvantaged families.Wilson's contributions to the field of psychology have been recognized posthumously through various awards and honors. In 2010, the Canadian Psychological Association established the Margo Wilson Award for Innovative Research to recognize early-career researchers who are continuing Wilson's legacy of groundbreaking research in psychology. Additionally, the Martin Daly and Margo Wilson Fund was established at McMaster University to support research on evolutionary psychology and related fields. Wilson's contributions to science and society continue to be celebrated, and her impact on the world of psychology will be felt for generations to come.</p><p>Wilson's research also delved into the field of human aggression and violence, with a particular focus on homicide. She and Daly proposed the controversial idea that homicides are largely caused by factors unrelated to mental illness or personal vendettas, but rather by social and economic factors that lead to high levels of violence in certain communities. This theory has since been supported by numerous studies and has been applied in the development of interventions and policies aimed at reducing violence in high-risk communities.Wilson's work on homicide and violence led her to become involved in legal proceedings as an expert witness, testifying in high-profile cases such as the trial of Paul Bernardo, a Canadian serial killer. She was a vocal critic of the use of psychiatric disorders as a defense in criminal trials and instead advocated for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex social and environmental factors that contribute to criminal behavior. Wilson's contributions to the field of forensic psychology have had a significant impact on the legal system and have been recognized by organizations such as the American Academy of Forensic Psychology.Wilson's approach to psychology was marked by a deep respect for scientific inquiry and a commitment to using evidence to inform our understanding of human behavior. Her legacy continues to inspire new generations of scholars and practitioners to apply rigorous research methods and critical thinking to the study of psychology and related fields.</p><p></p><p>
