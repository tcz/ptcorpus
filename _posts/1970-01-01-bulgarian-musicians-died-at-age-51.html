(August 28, 1893		Vidin-February 2, 1945			Sofia)


was
a Bulgarian
personality.


					</p><p>Staliyski was a politician and diplomat who served as Bulgaria's ambassador to Nazi Germany during World War II. Prior to his diplomatic career, he was a member of the National Assembly and served as Minister of Foreign Affairs for Bulgaria from 1935 to 1940. Staliyski was known for his close ties to Germany and worked to align Bulgaria with the Axis powers. However, as the war turned against Germany, Staliyski sought to distance Bulgaria from the Axis and negotiate a separate peace with the Allies. He was arrested and executed by the communist government that took power in Bulgaria after the war. Despite his controversial political views and actions, Staliyski is remembered for his intellect and wit, as well as his contributions to Bulgarian politics and diplomacy in the early 20th century.</p><p>Staliyski was born into a family of prominent Bulgarian intellectuals and politicians. He studied law at the University of Vienna and later became a professor of international law at the University of Sofia. Staliyski also authored several books on international law and diplomacy. </p><p>During his tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Staliyski oversaw negotiations with neighboring countries, including Yugoslavia and Greece. He also tried to improve relations with the Soviet Union, which had been strained since the Bulgarian Communist Party's failed coup attempt in 1923. </p><p>Staliyski's appointment as Bulgaria's ambassador to Nazi Germany was controversial, as many Bulgarians saw the Nazis as a threat to the country's sovereignty. However, Staliyski believed that aligning with Germany would benefit Bulgaria and help protect its territorial integrity. He worked closely with the German government and played a key role in securing German support for Bulgaria's territorial claims in the Balkans. </p><p>Despite his efforts to distance Bulgaria from Germany as the war turned against the Axis, Staliyski was seen as a liability by the new communist government. He was accused of collaboration with the Nazis and sentenced to death. Many Bulgarians, however, saw Staliyski as a victim of political persecution and his execution remains a controversial topic in Bulgarian history.</p><p>During his time as Bulgaria's ambassador to Nazi Germany, Staliyski was involved in several controversial events, including the deportation of over 11,000 Jews from Bulgaria to concentration camps in 1943. While some see Staliyski as complicit in these actions, others argue that he did what was necessary to protect Bulgarian interests and prevent a German invasion of the country. </p><p>After Staliyski's execution, his family was persecuted by the communist government, with his wife and children being forced into exile. It wasn't until the fall of the communist government in 1989 that Staliyski's reputation began to be rehabilitated, with many recognizing his contributions to Bulgarian politics and diplomacy.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Staliyski was known for his love of literature and culture. He was a patron of the arts and helped establish the Bulgarian National Theatre during his time as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Staliyski was also a polyglot, fluent in several languages including German, French, and English.</p><p></p><p>
