personality.


					</p><p>Hermann of Wied was also known as Hermann III, Count of Wied, and he belonged to the noble House of Wied. He was a prominent figure during the Reformation era, and his principality was located in the region of Westphalia. Hermann of Wied played a significant role in the Protestant Reformation movement, and he was one of the first princes in Germany to embrace the teachings of Martin Luther. Later, he became a prominent member of the Schmalkaldic League and actively participated in the political and religious events of the time. Despite his early association with Protestantism, Hermann of Wied struggled with his faith throughout his life and eventually converted to Roman Catholicism. He was married to a wealthy noblewoman, Elizabeth of Nassau-Dillenburg, and had several children with her. Hermann of Wied is remembered as a controversial historical figure who took part in many significant events during his lifetime.</p><p>As a supporter of the Reformation, Hermann of Wied implemented Lutheran reforms in his principality, including the use of the vernacular in the church service and the abolition of some Catholic practices such as the veneration of saints. He also established a university in his territory and advocated for the education of the common people. However, his views were not always popular, and he faced opposition from some of the more conservative members of his court.</p><p>Eventually, Hermann of Wied's religious views shifted again, and he converted to Roman Catholicism in 1542. This decision was met with widespread criticism and led to his exile from his principality. He spent the rest of his life traveling and attempting to reconcile his former Protestant colleagues with the Catholic Church.</p><p>Hermann of Wied's life and legacy have been the subject of much discussion and debate among historians. Some view him as a pragmatic and flexible politician, while others see him as a opportunist who changed his religious views for personal gain. Despite these controversies, his influence on the religious and political landscape of Germany during the Reformation era is undeniable.</p><p></p><p>

(May 16, 1823		Gröbzig-March 14, 1899			Berlin)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a renowned linguist, philosopher, and social scientist who contributed significantly to the study of language and culture. Steinthal was particularly interested in the interactions between language, thought, and culture, and he believed that understanding these relationships was essential to understanding human nature. He co-founded the Society for Ethnology and Anthropology in Berlin and was a professor of linguistics at the University of Berlin. Steinthal published several influential works, including "Der Ursprung der Sprache im Zusammenhang mit den letzten Fragen alles Wissens" (The Origin of Language in Connection with the Ultimate Questions of All Knowledge) and "Grammatik, Logik und Psychologie: Ihre Principien und ihr Verhältniss zueinander" (Grammar, Logic, and Psychology: Their Principles and Their Relationship to Each Other). His ideas had a significant impact on later linguistic and anthropological research, and he is considered one of the founders of modern anthropology.</p><p>Steinthal's interest in language and culture began in his youth, as he was exposed to several languages while growing up in a bilingual Jewish household. His education included studying history, philosophy, and philology in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Paris. Steinthal's fascination with language led him to study Hebrew, Arabic, and Sanskrit, and he later became interested in African and Native American languages. Steinthal's contributions to linguistics include developing the concept of "inner form" in language, which refers to the underlying structure of a language's grammar and syntax. He believed that language was a tool for expressing human thought and emotion, and that studying it could provide insights into the workings of the human mind. Steinthal also emphasized the importance of studying language in its cultural context, arguing that language cannot be fully understood without understanding the social and cultural practices in which it is embedded. He was recognized for his groundbreaking work in anthropology and linguistics, and was a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.</p><p></p><p>

In 1930, he became obsessed with a tuberculosis patient named Maria Elena Milagro "Helen" de Hoyos, whom he had treated at the hospital. Despite her death, Tanzler continuously attempted to contact her and eventually removed her body from its tomb, taking it to his home where he lived with it for years until it was discovered by authorities. Tanzler was arrested and put on trial, but due to a lack of evidence and a limitation on the statute of limitations, he was released and returned to Pasco County, where he died in 1952. Tanzler's story has since become a well-known case of obsession and necrophilia.</p><p>During his time living with Helen's remains, Tanzler constructed a makeshift laboratory in his home with the intention of reviving her, using various chemicals and equipment in his efforts. He even replaced her decomposed skin with silk, inserted glass eyes into her skull, and affixed a wig made from her real hair onto her scalp. Tanzler often spoke about his love for Helen and believed that she communicated with him through messages in the Cuban music he listened to on the radio.
