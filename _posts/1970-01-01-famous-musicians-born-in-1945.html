He continued to perform and record music throughout his career, even after leaving the Doobie Brothers in the mid-1980s. He passed away in 2004 at the age of 58 due to a heart attack.</p><p>Bumpus' musical career began at an early age, as he began playing the saxophone at age nine. He later attended San Jose State University where he studied music. In addition to his work with the Doobie Brothers and other well-known artists, Bumpus also performed as a solo artist and with his own band, the Cornelius Bumpus Quartet. He was also a session musician, working on various albums for other artists.</p><p>Bumpus was highly respected among his peers and was known for his versatility as a musician. He was equally skilled on the saxophone, guitar, and keyboards, and also had a powerful singing voice. His contributions to the Doobie Brothers' music helped to steer the band in a more soulful and funk-influenced direction.</p><p>In addition to his musical talents, Bumpus was also an accomplished pilot and owned his own plane. He was known for his love of flying and often traveled between gigs in his own aircraft.</p><p>Despite his passing, Bumpus' musical legacy lives on through his work with the Doobie Brothers and his solo recordings.

He left the band in 1969 to pursue other musical projects but later rejoined for a short period in the mid-1970s.</p><p>After leaving Moby Grape, Bumpus continued to collaborate with other musicians and bands.

His contribution to the band marked a significant change in their sound, as they began to incorporate more R&B and funk elements into their music. Bumpus' soulful saxophone playing was an essential part of their hit singles such as "Real Love," "One Step Closer," and "The Doctor."</p><p>After leaving the Doobie Brothers in the mid-1980s, Bumpus continued to perform and record music as a solo artist and with his band. In 1983, he released a solo album called "A Clear Day's Journey," which showcased his songwriting skills and eclectic taste in music.</p><p>Bumpus' passion for music was evident throughout his career, and he remained an active and inspiring figure in the music industry until his untimely death in 2004. He was renowned for his ability to infuse different genres of music with his unique style, and his legacy as a multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter will continue to inspire future generations of musicians.</p><p></p><p>
