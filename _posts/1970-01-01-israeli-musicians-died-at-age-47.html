(February 22, 1901		Manhattan-June 11, 1948			Abu Ghosh)


was
an Israeli
personality.


					</p><p>He was a former United States Army colonel who played a critical role in helping to establish and organize the Israeli army during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Prior to his work with the Israelis, Marcus had a distinguished military career in the United States, serving in both World War I and World War II. He was one of the first high-ranking American officers to volunteer his services to the fledgling Israeli army and quickly rose to prominence within the organization. Unfortunately, Marcus was tragically killed by friendly fire from an Israeli sentry while on a mission to investigate a Jordanian military position. Despite his short time serving in Israel, his contributions to the countryâ€™s military history have been recognized and celebrated.</p><p>Mickey Marcus was born to Jewish immigrant parents and grew up in New York City. He attended West Point military academy, where he was an exceptional athlete and student leader. Following graduation, Marcus served as a logistics officer in World War I and then went on to attend law school at Harvard. During World War II, Marcus served as a legal advisor to General George Patton and played a key role in the Normandy landings.</p><p>After the war, Marcus returned to civilian life but remained involved in military affairs. He was approached by Jewish leaders in Palestine to help train and organize their fledgling army. Despite initial resistance from the US government, Marcus eventually received permission to travel to Palestine and began working with the Haganah, the pre-state Jewish defense force.</p><p>Marcus quickly established himself as a skilled military strategist and played a crucial role in several key battles during the 1948 war. His death was a major blow to the Israeli effort, but his legacy as a pioneer of the country's armed forces endures to this day. Marcus was honored posthumously with an official military funeral in Israel and a monument erected in his memory at West Point.</p><p>Marcus was a firm believer in Jewish self-defense and was deeply committed to helping establish a Jewish state. He reportedly became a Zionist after witnessing the plight of European Jews during his time as a legal advisor for the American prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials. Marcus was not only an experienced military strategist but was also known for his charisma and ability to inspire his troops.</p><p>During his time in Palestine, Marcus developed a close friendship with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, who entrusted him with the important mission of turning the Haganah into a more professional and capable fighting force. Marcus was instrumental in expanding the Haganah's arsenal by acquiring weapons and ammunition from Europe and North Africa. He also helped to develop the military infrastructure needed to support a larger and more complex army.</p><p>Despite his important contributions to the Israeli cause, Marcus faced significant personal and political challenges during his time in Palestine. He struggled to gain the trust of some Haganah leaders who were suspicious of his American background and had fears that he might be a spy. Marcus also faced opposition from the US government, which was concerned that his involvement in the Israeli army might harm America's relations with the Arab world.</p><p>Marcus's tragic death was a significant loss for Israel, but he remains a symbol of Jewish courage and determination. In addition to the West Point monument, there are several places in Israel named after him, including a street in Jerusalem and a memorial park in his honor. Mickey Marcus's story has been dramatized in several films and books, including the popular 1966 movie "Cast a Giant Shadow," in which he was portrayed by Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas.</p><p></p><p>
