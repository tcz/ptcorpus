film director, actor, screenwriter and film producer.



						</p><p>He was born in Azerbaijan but grew up and began his career in Iran. Sabahi directed his first film "The House is Black" in 1962, which gained international recognition and critical acclaim. He went on to direct several other successful films, including "The Night of Hozn al-Qalam" and "Before the Explosion."</p><p>Sabahi was known for his socially conscious films that tackled difficult issues such as poverty, injustice, and discrimination. He was also an advocate for the Iranian New Wave movement, which was a departure from traditional Iranian cinema and focused on more realistic and artistic storytelling.</p><p>In addition to directing, Sabahi also acted in several films and was a prolific screenwriter and film producer. He received numerous awards throughout his career, including the Best Director award at the San Sebastian International Film Festival for his film "The Night of Hozn al-Qalam."</p><p>Samad Sabahi passed away in 1977 at the age of 37, leaving behind a legacy as one of Iran's most celebrated filmmakers.</p><p>Despite his short life, Samad Sabahi managed to leave a lasting impact on Iranian cinema. Born to Azerbaijani parents in the city of Tabriz, he moved to Tehran as a child. After studying film at the College of Dramatic Arts in Tehran, he began his career as an assistant director and screenwriter. Sabahi's directorial debut, "The House is Black," is considered a landmark of Iranian non-fiction cinema for its unique portrayal of leprosy patients in a remote Iranian colony. The film won several awards at international film festivals and was praised for its subject matter and artistry.</p><p>Sabahi's subsequent films continued to explore themes of social relevance and human suffering. "The Night of Hozn al-Qalam" dealt with the corruption and exploitation faced by Iranian writers and intellectuals during the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. "Before the Explosion," which he directed just before his death, depicted the struggles of impoverished Iranians in the lead-up to the Islamic Revolution of 1979.</p><p>Sabahi was a key figure in the Iranian New Wave, a movement that emerged in the 1960s and 70s in response to the dominance of commercial cinema in Iran. He was known for his experimental style, use of natural light, and sparse, understated dialogue. He often employed non-professional actors and created documentaries that captured the everyday realities of Iranian life.</p><p>Sabahi's films were not always well-received by Iranian authorities, and he was briefly imprisoned in 1969 after the release of "The Night of Hozn al-Qalam." However, his impact on Iranian cinema and his commitment to telling stories of social injustice and human suffering continue to inspire filmmakers to this day.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/indian-actresses-died-in-natural-causes.html' title='Indian actresses died in Natural causes'><strong>Indian actresses died in Natural causes</strong> List of the top 6 Indian actresses who died in Natural causes</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-musicians-died-at-age-40.html' title='Canadian musicians died at age 40'><strong>Canadian musicians died at age 40</strong> List of the top 2 Canadian music stars who died when they were 40</a></li><li><a href='/french-actors-died-in-complication.html' title='French actors died in Complication'><strong>French actors died in Complication</strong> List of the top 1 French actors who died in Complication</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/japanese-actresses-died-in-1993.html' title='Japanese actresses died in 1993'><strong>Japanese actresses died in 1993</strong> List of the top 1 Japanese actresses who died in 1993</a></li><li><a href='/british-actresses-died-at-age-69.html' title='British actresses died at age 69'><strong>British actresses died at age 69</strong> List of the top 10 British actresses who died when they were 69</a></li><li><a href='/indonesian-actors-died-before-turning-30.html' title='Indonesian actors died before turning 30'><strong>Indonesian actors died before turning 30</strong> List of the top 1 Indonesian actors who died before they turned 30</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
