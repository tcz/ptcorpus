(April 5, 1881-July 22, 1904)


was
a Canadian
personality.


					</p><p>He was best known for his involvement in a high-profile murder case in New York City, where he was accused of killing a millionaire textile merchant. Despite proclaiming his innocence and the lack of concrete evidence against him, George was found guilty and sentenced to death by electrocution. His trial and execution drew widespread attention and controversy, with many calling for a re-examination of the evidence and a more humane method of execution. Despite this, George was ultimately put to death and his case remains a subject of fascination for true crime enthusiasts to this day.</p><p>George Gee was born in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada. He came from a poor family and was known for his striking appearance and charming personality. He moved to the United States and took odd jobs to support himself. </p><p>In 1904, at the age of 23, he was arrested for the murder of David H. Dunkle, a wealthy New York City textile merchant. George had been seen in Dunkle's company the night of the murder, but no direct evidence linked him to the crime. The prosecution built its case on circumstantial evidence, and experts at the time disagreed on the veracity of the evidence.</p><p>Despite protests from supporters who believed in his innocence, George was found guilty and sentenced to death by electrocution. His lawyers made several appeals, but all were denied. George was executed on July 22, 1904, at Sing Sing prison.</p><p>After George's death, his case continued to attract attention and scrutiny. Some believed he was innocent and had been wrongly convicted, citing inconsistencies in the evidence presented at trial. Others believed he was guilty and had simply gotten away with murder. His case has been the subject of books, articles, and even a play, and it remains a topic of debate among true crime enthusiasts.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his conviction and execution, little is known about George's life before his involvement in the murder case. It is unclear why he moved to the United States or how he met David Dunkle, the victim in the case. His family in Canada reportedly disowned him after his arrest, and it is not known if he had any other close relationships in his life. Nonetheless, his case remains a tragic example of the flaws of the criminal justice system and the complex relationship between justice and truth.</p><p></p><p>
