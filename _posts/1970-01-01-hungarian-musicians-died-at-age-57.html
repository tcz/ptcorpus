									</h1><p>Here are 10 famous musicians from Hungary died at 57:</p><h2>János Bolyai</h2><p><strong>János Bolyai</strong>
(December 15, 1802		Cluj-Napoca-January 27, 1860			Târgu Mureș)

	
		a.k.a. Janos Bolyai

	
was
a Hungarian
mathematician.


					</p><p>He is known for his work on non-Euclidean geometry, which he developed independently of Nikolai Lobachevsky. His most famous work is the "Appendix" to his father's work "Tentamen," in which he presented his own ideas on geometry. He also made contributions to the study of polyhedra and was one of the first mathematicians to examine the concept of infinity. Despite his significant contributions to mathematics, Bolyai struggled with personal and financial difficulties throughout his life, and his work was often overshadowed by that of others. Nonetheless, his legacy has endured, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important mathematicians of the 19th century.</p><p>Bolyai was born into a family of mathematicians and scientists, his father being the mathematician Farkas Bolyai. He received his education from his father who was a strict teacher and he was exposed to mathematics from a very young age. He was an exceptional student and at the age of 13, he was sent to the Imperial and Royal military academy in Vienna to study. However, he left the academy after a year and returned to Cluj to study with his father.</p><p>During his studies, Bolyai struggled with depression and suffered from insomnia, which led him to become reclusive. He spent many years working in isolation, studying mathematics, and developing his ideas. In 1820, he began working on the geometry of space and developed the idea of imagery, which served as the basis for his work on non-Euclidean geometry.</p><p>Despite his significant contributions to mathematics, Bolyai found it difficult to gain recognition for his work, both during his lifetime and after his death. He was largely ignored in the mathematical community, and it was not until the early 20th century that his work on non-Euclidean geometry was fully appreciated.</p><p>Bolyai never achieved the financial success that he desired, and he spent much of his life in poverty. He passed away in 1860, leaving behind a legacy that would continue to influence mathematics for decades to come. Today, he is remembered as a pioneer in the field of non-Euclidean geometry and is recognized as one of the great mathematicians of his time.</p><p>In addition to his work in mathematics, János Bolyai also had a keen interest in linguistics and spoke several languages, including Hungarian, German, Latin, Greek, Romanian, and French. He even invented a language called "Deutschungarisch" which was a combination of German and Hungarian.</p><p>Bolyai's work on infinity and the concept of the "absolute" was influenced by the philosopher Immanuel Kant, whose ideas he studied extensively. He also corresponded with other great mathematicians of his time, including Carl Friedrich Gauss and Bernhard Riemann.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced in his personal and professional life, Bolyai remained dedicated to his work and continued to innovate and make groundbreaking discoveries in mathematics. His contributions to the field have had a profound impact and continue to influence mathematicians today.</p><p></p><p>

(February 28, 1824		Vienna-January 23, 1882			Budapest)

	
		a.k.a. Karl-Maria Benkert or Károly Mária Kertbeny

	
was
a Hungarian
writer and journalist.


					</p><p>He is best known for coining the terms "homosexual" and "heterosexual." Kertbeny was a polyglot who spoke several languages, including German, Hungarian, and French. He was an advocate for human rights, particularly for sexual minorities. His writings challenged the prudishness and moralistic attitudes of his time, and he worked to remove legal barriers to sexuality. In addition to his activism, Kertbeny was also a respected scholar, publishing books on subjects ranging from ancient Egypt to the history of chess. He died in 1882 in Budapest, but his legacy lives on through his contributions to the field of sexual rights and his enduring impact on modern language.</p><p>Karl-Maria Kertbeny was born into a German-speaking Jewish family, but later in life he converted to Catholicism. He received a degree in Law from the University of Vienna, and went on to work as a journalist and translator. It was during his work as a translator that he became interested in sexual psychology and the various cultural attitudes towards sexuality. Kertbeny was known for being a progressive thinker who believed in individual freedom and autonomy. He was also a champion of women's rights and worked to advocate for the rights of women in the workplace and in education. Despite facing criticism and persecution for his beliefs, Kertbeny continued to write and publish works that challenged the norms of his time. Today, he is often cited as an important figure in the history of LGBTQ+ rights and his contributions to modern language continue to be felt.</p><p>Kertbeny's advocacy for sexual rights began in the mid-19th century with his efforts to repeal Germany's legal prohibitions against homosexuality. He believed that these laws were not only unjust, but also harmful to society. He argued that people have the right to choose their own sexual partners and that consensual sexual activity between adults should not be subject to legal punishment. In 1868, he anonymously published a pamphlet called "Paragraph 143," which was a critique of Germany's sodomy laws. He followed this up with several other publications on the subject of sexual rights, using the pseudonym K.M. Benkert.</p><p>Kertbeny's work was influential in shaping public opinion and challenging the prevailing attitudes toward sexuality. He was one of the first people to argue that homosexuality was not a mental illness or a moral failing, but a natural variation of human sexuality. He also introduced the concept of "heterosexuality," which he defined as sexual attraction to the opposite sex. His efforts to distinguish between different forms of sexuality paved the way for future research into human sexual orientation.</p><p>Despite his important contributions to the field of sexual rights, Kertbeny's legacy was largely forgotten after his death. It wasn't until the 20th century, when the LGBTQ+ rights movement began to gain momentum, that his work was rediscovered and appreciated. Today, Kertbeny is considered a pioneer in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights and his writings continue to inspire and inform activists around the world.</p><p></p><p>
