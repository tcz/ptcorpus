					</p><p>Seress is best known for composing the song "Gloomy Sunday," which became an international sensation in the 1930s and 1940s. The song is often called the "Hungarian Suicide Song" because of its melancholy lyrics and association with reported suicides. Seress himself struggled with depression and became increasingly isolated after "Gloomy Sunday" became popular. He continued to compose music and perform in Hungary and internationally, but never achieved the same level of success as his famous song. In addition to his music career, Seress also acted in several Hungarian films in the 1930s and 1940s. Despite his enduring legacy with "Gloomy Sunday," Seress died by suicide in 1968 at the age of 68.</p><p></p><p>
