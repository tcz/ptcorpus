(June 21, 1868		São Luís-January 26, 1931			Rio de Janeiro)

	
		also known as Graca Aranha

	
was
a Brazilian
writer and diplomat.


					</p><p>He is most famous for his novel "Canaã" which was published in 1902 and is considered a masterpiece of Brazilian literary modernism. Aranha was also a prominent intellectual figure in Brazil and was instrumental in the development of the Modernist Movement in Brazilian literature. </p><p>In addition to his literary achievements, Aranha was a distinguished diplomat who served as Brazil's ambassador to both the United States and France. He was also involved in organizing the Brazilian Pavilion at the 1922 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris, which helped promote Brazilian art and culture to an international audience.</p><p>Aranha was widely respected for his contributions to Brazilian culture and was a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Despite his success as a writer and diplomat, Aranha suffered from depression throughout his life and died by suicide in 1931. Nevertheless, his impact on Brazilian literature and culture continues to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Throughout his life, Graça Aranha was an avid supporter of Brazilian nationalism, which he believed was key to the country's cultural and political development. He was particularly interested in the relationship between Brazil and the United States, and was one of the organizers of the 1922 Brazilian Week exhibition in New York, which showcased Brazilian art and culture to American audiences.</p><p>Aranha was also well known for his essays, which dealt with a range of subjects including aesthetics, philosophy, and Brazilian politics. His most famous essay, "Estética da Vida" ("The Aesthetics of Life"), published in 1920, dealt with the role of art in society and was widely influential in shaping the aesthetics of Modernism in Brazil.</p><p>In addition to his literary and diplomatic work, Aranha was also involved in the development of education in Brazil. He founded the Brazilian Academy of Fine Arts in Rio de Janeiro in 1930, with the goal of promoting the study and practice of the fine arts in the country.</p><p>Despite his depression, Aranha's legacy continues to be celebrated in Brazil. In 1968, on the centenary of his birth, the Brazilian government declared him a "Hero of Brazilian Culture." His novel "Canaã" continues to be read and studied in Brazilian universities, and his contributions to Brazilian literature and culture are widely recognized.</p><p>In addition to his political and cultural activities, Graça Aranha also had a strong interest in spirituality and mysticism. In his later years, he became increasingly drawn to Theosophy, a spiritual movement that sought to blend Eastern and Western spiritual traditions. Aranha's interest in Theosophy is reflected in his later works, such as his novel "Seara Vermelha" ("Red Harvest"), which features characters who are members of a Theosophical society. </p><p>Aranha's influence on Brazilian literature was significant, as he helped shift the focus of Brazilian literature away from traditional romanticism and towards modernist and avant-garde styles. He was also a key figure in the creation of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, which aimed to promote the development of Brazilian literature and language.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Aranha was not without controversy. He was criticized by some for his support of European modernism and for his association with the Brazilian elite. Some of his political views were also controversial, particularly his support of eugenics and his belief that Brazil should strive to become a "racial democracy" by promoting miscegenation.</p><p>Despite these criticisms, Graça Aranha remains an important figure in Brazilian culture and his work continues to be an inspiration to many writers and intellectuals.</p><p>In addition to his interest in spirituality and mysticism, Graça Aranha was also a polyglot, fluent in several languages including Portuguese, French, English, Spanish, and German. This proficiency in languages was instrumental in his diplomatic career, as he was able to communicate effectively with diplomats from various countries. Aranha was also a proponent of Pan-Americanism, advocating for greater cooperation and unity among the countries of the Americas. He believed that Brazil had a unique role to play in the development of a Pan-American culture, given its size and diversity. Aranha's legacy continues to be studied and celebrated in Brazil, where his contributions to literature, politics, and diplomacy are widely recognized.</p><p></p><p>

(February 17, 1816		Sorocaba-June 26, 1878			Vienna)


was
a Brazilian
writer, diplomat, historian and soldier.


					</p><p>Varnhagen was born to a family of German origin and arrived in Brazil at a young age. He enlisted in the Brazilian Army and participated in the War of Cisplatina and the Farroupilha Revolution. After leaving the military, he traveled to Europe, where he developed an interest in history and began writing about Brazil's past. In 1844, he published his most notable work, "Historia Geral do Brasil," which remains one of the most important works of Brazilian historiography. Varnhagen was also a successful diplomat, serving in both Portugal and Austria-Hungary, where he was appointed as Brazil's ambassador. His contributions to Brazilian history and culture were recognized in 1847, when he was awarded the title of Viscount of Porto Seguro by Emperor Pedro II.</p><p>Varnhagen's passion for history led him to found the Brazilian Historical and Geographical Institute in 1838, which remains an important institution today. In addition to his own writings, Varnhagen translated several important works into Portuguese, including the letters of Christopher Columbus. He was also an influential figure in the cultural life of Brazil, promoting the study of Brazilian literature and arts. Despite spending much of his adult life abroad, Varnhagen remained deeply connected to his homeland and continued to write about Brazil until his death. His contributions to Brazilian literature and history have made him an important figure in the country's intellectual history.</p><p>Varnhagen's interest in history was influenced by his travels to Europe, where he was able to access important historical documents and archives. He was particularly interested in the history of the Portuguese empire and its colonization of Brazil. His research into Brazil's past was groundbreaking and helped to establish the field of Brazilian historiography as a serious academic discipline.</p><p>In addition to his writing and diplomatic work, Varnhagen was also an avid collector of art and artifacts related to Brazil's history and culture. He amassed a significant collection of works, which he donated to the Brazilian Historical and Geographical Institute upon his death.</p><p>Later in life, Varnhagen was plagued by health problems and spent much of his time traveling in search of a cure. He died at the age of 62 while on a trip to Vienna. Despite his untimely death, his legacy lives on as an important figure in Brazilian history and culture.</p><p>Varnhagen's contributions to Brazilian culture were not limited to writing and historical research. He was also interested in promoting the arts, and was a driving force behind the establishment of the Brazilian Academy of Fine Arts in 1826. He recognized the importance of encouraging artists to create works that reflected Brazil's unique identity and history, and worked tirelessly to support and promote the development of Brazilian art.</p><p>Varnhagen also played an important role in the political life of Brazil. In addition to serving as a diplomat, he was involved in various political movements and was an advocate for the abolition of slavery. He was a strong supporter of Emperor Pedro II, and served as his personal advisor on matters of state.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Varnhagen's legacy has been somewhat overshadowed by controversy over his views on race and indigenous peoples. In his writing, he often portrayed indigenous Brazilians in a negative light, and believed that Brazil's mixed-race population was inferior to Europeans. While this perspective was not uncommon for his time, it has since been widely criticized as biased and ethnocentric.</p><p>Despite these criticisms, Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen remains a significant figure in Brazilian intellectual history. His contributions to scholarship, diplomacy, and the arts have made him an enduring symbol of Brazil's cultural heritage and national identity.</p><p></p><p>
