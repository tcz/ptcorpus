						music stars who deceased at age
						39
									</h1><p>Here are 2 famous musicians from Iraq died at 39:</p><h2>Uday Hussein</h2><p><strong>Uday Hussein</strong>
(June 18, 1964		Tikrit-July 22, 2003			Mosul)

	
		also known as Uday Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti

	
was
an Iraqi
personality.


					</p><p>Uday Hussein was the eldest son of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. He was known for his notorious and violent behavior, as well as his role as chairman of the Iraqi Olympic Committee. Uday was widely feared by the Iraqi people, who viewed him as being above the law due to his connections to the ruling regime. He was responsible for a number of horrific crimes, including the torture and murder of political dissidents, journalists, and athletes who failed to perform to his standards.</p><p>Despite his numerous crimes and abuses of power, Uday was often seen as being the heir apparent to his father's throne. However, his poor health and increasingly erratic behavior in the years leading up to the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 meant that he was unlikely to take over the presidency. Uday narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1996 that left him partially paralyzed, and his death in 2003 was widely celebrated by the Iraqi people.</p><p>Uday Hussein was also known for his extravagant lifestyle and love of luxury cars, yachts, and women. He was known to throw lavish parties and was often seen with a cigar in hand. Uday was also an avid sports enthusiast, particularly in soccer, and used his position as the chairman of the Iraqi Olympic Committee to promote sports in the country. However, his successes in sports were often overshadowed by his cruel treatment of athletes who did not meet his expectations. Uday's control over the media in Iraq meant that any negative stories about him or his family were suppressed or met with severe consequences. Despite his notoriety and violent behavior, some people in Iraq were still loyal to him due in part to his father's legacy and the power of their family. Despite this, his legacy remains that of a ruthless dictator's son who abused his power and ultimately met a violent end.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in firearm.
