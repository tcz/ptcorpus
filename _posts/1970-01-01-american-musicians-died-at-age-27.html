		also known as Jean Michel Basquiat or SAMO

					</p><p>Basquiat rose to fame in the 1980s New York art scene, where his unique blend of graffiti, street art, and fine art caught the attention of collectors and galleries. His work often addressed themes of race, identity, and social commentary. Basquiat's collaborations with artist Andy Warhol are some of his most famous works. Despite his brief career, lasting only about a decade, Basquiat's impact on the art world has been significant and his artwork continues to be highly prized today.</p><p>After dropping out of high school and leaving his father's home, Basquiat began using the pseudonym "SAMO" to promote his graffiti around Manhattan with his friend Al Diaz. The graffiti soon became recognized as a form of art and people began to take notice of Basquiat's unique style. In 1981, he had his first solo art show in New York and was then invited to exhibit his work in galleries around the world.</p><p>Basquiat's work has been showcased in some of the most prestigious museums and galleries worldwide, including the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. He has been the subject of several documentaries, books and movies, including the 1996 movie "Basquiat" directed by Julian Schnabel.</p><p>Besides his artistic talents, Basquiat was also a musician and founded the industrial band Gray with Michael Holman in the 1970s. He also worked as a music producer and collaborated with artists such as Madonna and David Bowie.</p><p>Basquiat's legacy continues to inspire and influence artists all around the world. He has been described as a cultural icon and his unique artistic expression will always be remembered.</p><p>Basquiat's upbringing in Brooklyn heavily influenced the themes of his artwork, particularly in his representation of African-American identity and his critiques of institutionalized racism. His father was of Haitian and Puerto Rican descent, and his mother was Puerto Rican. His mother encouraged his artistic pursuits and exposed him to art at a young age, taking him to museums and enrolling him in weekend art classes.</p><p>In addition to his collaborations with Andy Warhol, Basquiat also worked with other artists such as Keith Haring and Francesco Clemente. He was a part of the Neo-Expressionist movement, which emerged in the 1980s and emphasized a return to emotional, expressive imagery in art.</p><p>Basquiat's art often featured a mix of words and images, drawing on his background in graffiti and his experiences with language and literature. He was also known for his use of African-American motifs and symbolism.</p><p>Despite his success, Basquiat struggled with addiction throughout his life, which ultimately led to his untimely death at the age of 27. However, his influence on the art world continues to be felt today, with his artwork fetching record-breaking prices at auctions and inspiring a new generation of artists.</p><p>Basquiat's artworks featured a wide range of mediums, including painting, drawing, and sculpture. He often incorporated found objects into his art, such as doors or electrical panels, giving his pieces a raw and gritty feel. He was also deeply influenced by jazz and bebop music, which he saw as a form of African-American cultural expression. Basquiat's impact on the art world went beyond his artwork; he also used his fame to bring attention to the socio-political issues of his time, such as apartheid and police brutality. In 1985, he painted a mural called "Defacement: The Death of Michael Stewart" in honor of a young black artist who died in police custody. Basquiat's artistic legacy continues to inspire artists today, and his personal story has been the subject of numerous books, films, and exhibitions.</p><p></p><p>
