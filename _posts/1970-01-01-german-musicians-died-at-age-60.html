(November 25, 1841		Mannheim-June 16, 1902			Karlsruhe)

	
		also known as Ernst Schroder

	
was
a German
mathematician.


					</p><p>Schröder is known for his contributions to the field of algebraic logic and for his work on set theory. He is particularly recognized for his creation of the algebraic system of logic, which used mathematical symbols and operations to represent logical propositions and arguments. This work laid the foundation for modern mathematical logic.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to mathematics, Schröder was also a noted educator, serving as a professor at the Karlsruhe Polytechnic School for over 30 years. He wrote several textbooks on mathematics, including "Lehrbuch der Algebra der Logik" (Textbook of the Algebra of Logic), which was widely used in universities throughout Europe.</p><p>Schröder was a member of several scientific societies, including the Royal Society of Sciences in Göttingen and the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He was also awarded the prestigious Lobachevsky Prize for his contributions to mathematics.</p><p>Today, Schröder's work on algebraic logic continues to influence the development of computer science and artificial intelligence, as well as the study of formal systems and reasoning.</p><p>Schröder also made important contributions to the field of set theory. In his 1874 paper "On the Concept of Number and Its Logical Deduction," he presented an early version of what is now known as the Schroeder-Bernstein theorem, which provides a way to compare the cardinality of different sets. Schröder's work on set theory helped lay the foundation for the study of infinite sets and helped establish set theory as a separate field of mathematics.</p><p>In addition to his mathematical and educational accomplishments, Schröder was also an active member of the religious community. He served as an organist and choir director at several local churches and composed several choral works.</p><p>Schröder's legacy continues to be celebrated in the mathematical community. The Ernst Schröder Prize, awarded by the German Mathematical Society, recognizes outstanding contributions to the field of algebraic logic.</p><p>Schröder was born in Mannheim, Germany, in 1841. His father was a businessman, and his mother was a musician. Schröder showed an early aptitude for mathematics and music, and he excelled in both subjects throughout his life. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Heidelberg and later earned his doctorate from the University of Göttingen.</p><p>After completing his studies, Schröder worked as a private tutor and taught at various schools throughout Germany. In 1872, he was appointed professor of mathematics at the Karlsruhe Polytechnic School, where he remained until his death in 1902.</p><p>Schröder's work on algebraic logic was groundbreaking and influential. Prior to his work, formal logic was based primarily on Aristotle's syllogisms and the work of George Boole. Schröder's algebraic system of logic allowed for more complex and nuanced representations of logical propositions and arguments, and it paved the way for the development of modern symbolic logic.</p><p>Schröder's work on set theory was also highly significant. His contributions to the field helped clarify the concept of infinity and established a foundation for the study of infinite sets. His Schroeder-Bernstein theorem continues to be an important tool in modern mathematics.</p><p>Schröder's contributions to mathematics and logic were widely recognized during his lifetime. He was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Geneva and the University of Giessen, and he was elected a member of several scientific societies.</p><p>Schröder's legacy continues to inspire mathematicians and logicians today. His work on algebraic logic and set theory remains highly influential, and his contributions to the field continue to be celebrated through awards and prizes in his honor.</p><p></p><p>

(June 10, 1715		Leuna-October 18, 1775			Leipzig)


was
a German
philosopher.


					</p><p>He studied at the University of Leipzig, where he later became a professor of philosophy. Crusius was known for his work on ethics and epistemology, and he was an important figure in the development of the German Enlightenment.</p><p>Crusius was critical of the philosophy of his time, which he saw as overly abstract and disconnected from practical concerns. Instead, he argued for a more practical approach to ethics, one that focused on living a virtuous life and helping others.</p><p>In his work on epistemology, Crusius emphasized the role of experience and perception in knowledge acquisition. He rejected the idea that reason alone could lead to certain knowledge, arguing instead that our beliefs are shaped by our experiences.</p><p>Overall, Crusius was an important figure in the development of modern German philosophy, and his ideas had a significant impact on the thought of his time.</p><p>His ideas also influenced the famous German philosopher Immanuel Kant, who was one of his students. In fact, Kant considered Crusius to be one of his most important philosophical influences. Crusius himself was also influenced by the ideas of the British philosopher John Locke, as well as the German philosopher Christian Wolff. Crusius' most famous work is his "Anweisung vernünftig zu leben" ("Instructions for Living Reasonably"), which was published posthumously in 1779. In this work, he set out his ideas for living a virtuous life and emphasized the importance of practical ethics. Though less well-known today than some of his contemporaries, Christian August Crusius remains an important figure in the history of German philosophy.</p><p>Crusius was also interested in theology and wrote extensively on the relationship between reason and faith. He argued that reason could be used to support religious belief, but that it was ultimately an act of faith. Crusius believed that Christianity was the true religion, but he also emphasized the importance of tolerance and respect for other religions. He saw Christianity as a guide for living a virtuous and ethical life, rather than just a set of beliefs to be accepted.</p><p>In addition to his philosophical work, Crusius was also a prolific writer of textbooks and educational materials. He believed that education was crucial for the development of individuals and society as a whole, and he aimed to make learning accessible to all. His textbooks on logic, metaphysics, and ethics were widely used in German universities and schools.</p><p>Crusius was known for his gentle demeanor and his commitment to his students. He placed a high value on personal relationships and believed that education was not just about imparting knowledge, but also about cultivating character and virtue.</p><p>Today, Crusius is remembered as an important figure in the development of German philosophy and the Enlightenment. His emphasis on practical ethics and the importance of experience in knowledge acquisition continue to be influential. While he may not be as well-known as some of his contemporaries, Crusius' contributions to philosophy and education continue to be felt today.</p><p></p><p>

					</p><p>He was a renowned poet, playwright, and writer. Götz is best known for his work "Gotz von Berlichingen," a play that tells the story of a famous knight from the 16th century. His literary style was mostly influenced by the Sturm und Drang movement, which focused on strong emotions and individualism. Aside from his literary works, Götz was also a civil servant of the Holy Roman Empire. He served as the chief administrator of the principality of Eichstätt for over two decades. Additionally, he was appointed as the imperial councilor and the director of the salt works in Reichenhall. Despite his important government positions, Götz was able to continue writing and publishing his works until his death.</p><p>Götz's childhood was marked by tragedy as he lost his mother and two siblings at a young age. He was educated at the University of Jena and later studied law at the University of Göttingen. After completing his studies, Götz worked in various government positions, which allowed him to travel extensively throughout Europe.</p><p>In addition to "Gotz von Berlichingen," Götz wrote several other plays and works of poetry, including "Die Fischerin," "Claudine von Villabella," and "Ode an die Freude." He believed that art should be accessible to all people, regardless of social status, and he often used vernacular language in his works.</p><p>Götz's works had a significant impact on the development of German literature and are still studied and performed today. His legacy also extends to the town of Jagsthausen, where an annual festival is held in his honor. The festival includes performances of his plays, as well as concerts and other cultural events.</p><p>Götz's work "Gotz von Berlichingen" was not only a literary success but also became a symbol of resistance against the German aristocracy. The play's portrayal of Berlichingen as a fighter against the oppression of the ruling class resonated with the German people, who were experiencing social and political upheaval in the late 18th century. In addition to his literary and governmental work, Götz was also a Freemason, and his involvement in the organization influenced his writing, particularly in themes of brotherhood and enlightenment. Götz was married twice and had several children. His second wife, Anna Rosina Sophie von Lerchenfeld, was the inspiration for his play "Claudine von Villabella." Despite his successes, Götz faced financial difficulties later in life and was supported by the generosity of friends and patrons. Nonetheless, his works continue to be celebrated for their emotional intensity, memorable characters, and contribution to German literature.</p><p></p><p>
