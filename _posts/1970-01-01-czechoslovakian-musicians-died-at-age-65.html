(November 4, 1931		Ostrava-July 12, 1997)


was
a Czechoslovakian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a renowned artist, sculptor and glass designer. Wiecek's artistic journey began when he enrolled in the School of Applied Arts and Crafts in Prague, where he studied sculpture and then moved to the Academy of Applied Arts, where he earned his degree in glass art. Wiecek went on to become a prominent figure in the Czechoslovakian art scene, and his work was exhibited in numerous galleries around the world, including in the USA, Japan, Germany and France. His artwork has been described as beautiful, imaginative and full of depth, and his unique approach to glasswork has earned him a place in history as one of the most original and innovative glass artists of his time.</p><p>Wiecek's artistic pieces were not only admired for their intricate design but also for their deep meaning. His sculptures often depicted humanity, exploring the human form and its relationship with the world around it. Additionally, his glasswork, which consisted of ornate vases and intricate blown sculptures, highlighted the fragility and resilience of the material. </p><p>Wiecek's contributions to the field of art were recognized with numerous awards, including the prestigious Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres from the French government. In the mid-1980s, he was also named a National Artist of Czechoslovakia, cementing his place as one of the country's most important cultural figures. </p><p>Throughout his life, Wiecek also provided mentorship to upcoming artists, serving as a professor at the Academy of Arts, Architecture, and Design in Prague. Despite his passing in 1997, his legacy continues to inspire and influence the glass art community, and his pieces can be found in collections around the world.</p><p>Wiecek's impact extended beyond his artistic endeavors, as he was also known for his political activism. During the Velvet Revolution in 1989, he was among the artists and cultural figures who played a pivotal role in advocating for democracy and artistic freedom in Czechoslovakia. Wiecek used his influence to fight against censorship and repression, and his involvement in these efforts earned him the respect of the Czechoslovakian people. In addition to his art and politics, Wiecek was also a devoted family man. He married his wife Vlasta in 1956, and together they raised two children. Despite his success and busy schedule, Wiecek always made time for his family and cherished his time at home in their countryside retreat. Even after his passing, his family has continued to preserve his legacy, showcasing his artwork and maintaining his status as one of Czechoslovakia's greatest cultural icons.</p><p>One of Wiecek's most iconic works is a sculpture titled "The Struggle," which was created in 1965. The piece depicts two human figures locked in a seemingly endless struggle, symbolizing the struggle between humanity and its own nature. The work has been interpreted in many ways, with some seeing it as a commentary on the Cold War and others seeing it as a representation of the struggle for artistic freedom. Whatever the interpretation, "The Struggle" is widely regarded as one of Wiecek's most powerful and thought-provoking creations.</p><p>In addition to his artistic and political pursuits, Wiecek was also a lover of nature and the outdoors. He was an avid hiker and spent much of his free time exploring the Czech countryside, often taking inspiration from the natural world for his artwork. He also had a love of animals, and his home was filled with pets, including dogs, cats and even a parrot.</p><p>Wiecek's untimely death in 1997 was a great loss to the Czechoslovakian art community, but his contributions continue to be celebrated and appreciated to this day. His unique perspective and innovative approach to glasswork and sculpture have left a lasting impression on the world of art, and his legacy serves as a testament to the power of creativity and artistic expression.</p><p></p><p>

was
a Czechoslovakian
architect.


					</p><p>During his career, Hudec designed over 50 buildings in Shanghai, China, making him one of the most prominent architects of the city's pre-1949 Golden Era. His work includes iconic buildings like the Park Hotel, the Grand Theatre, and the St. Ignatius Cathedral.

He was also a professor at universities in Shanghai and was known for his dedication to teaching and mentoring young architects. Hudec's legacy continues to influence architecture in China, and his buildings remain some of the most recognizable landmarks in Shanghai today.</p><p>Hudec was born into a Catholic family in what is now Slovakia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He received his architecture degree from the Budapest Royal Polytechnic Institute in Hungary in 1917, and went on to work in various architectural firms in Europe before relocating to Shanghai in 1918. Hudec originally intended to stay in Shanghai for just a few years, but ended up spending the rest of his career there.</p><p>In addition to his work as an architect, Hudec was a key figure in Shanghai's social and cultural scene. He was a member of the Shanghai Race Club, and was known for throwing lavish parties in his luxurious penthouse apartment in the historic Grosvenor House building. He was also involved in various philanthropic endeavors, including fundraising for the construction of the St. Ignatius Cathedral.</p><p>After the Communist Party took power in China in 1949, Hudec left Shanghai and moved to the United States. He settled in Berkeley, California and continued to practice architecture there until his death in 1958. Today, Hudec is remembered as one of the most important architects of modern Shanghai, and his buildings continue to attract visitors from around the world.</p><p>Throughout his time in Shanghai, Hudec was highly regarded by both his peers and clients. He was known for his excellent communication skills and his ability to incorporate the needs and requests of his clients while still maintaining his unique architectural style. Hudec's commitment to incorporating Chinese culture into his designs was rooted in his belief that architecture should reflect the culture and context in which it is built.</p><p>Hudec was also a prolific writer, and his articles on architecture were published in various newspapers and magazines in China and around the world. He was a vocal advocate for the importance of architectural education, and his lectures and writings on the subject influenced a generation of young architects in China.</p><p>Despite the challenges he faced as a foreign architect in China during a tumultuous period of history, Hudec's legacy endures. His buildings continue to be cherished by residents and visitors alike, and his influence on the development of modern architecture in China is widely recognized. Today, the Park Hotel, Grand Theatre, and St. Ignatius Cathedral - three of Hudec's most iconic buildings - are popular tourist attractions and are often featured in films and television shows set in Shanghai.</p><p>Hudec's design philosophy emphasized the importance of functionality, sustainability, and innovation. He believed that buildings should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also serve a practical purpose and be built with consideration for the environment. He utilized new materials and construction techniques in his designs, such as reinforced concrete, which allowed for greater flexibility and durability. Hudec's legacy also includes his contributions to the development of modern urban planning in China, as he was a strong advocate for creating livable, walkable cities with green spaces for public use.</p><p>In addition to his architectural work, Hudec was a passionate collector of art and antiques. He amassed a vast collection of Chinese ceramics, furniture, and paintings during his time in Shanghai, which he brought with him to the United States. Hudec's collection is now housed in the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, and is considered one of the most important collections of Chinese art in the United States.</p><p>Overall, László Hudec was a multifaceted figure whose contributions to architecture, urban planning, and cultural exchange have had a lasting impact on the city of Shanghai and beyond. His dedication to innovation, sustainability, and cultural sensitivity in architecture continue to inspire architects and planners today.</p><p></p><p>
