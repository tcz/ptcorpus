						</p><p>She was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1894 and began her acting career in the early 1900s. In 1915, she made her film debut in "Fuglefængerne fra Gjættrup," and went on to appear in numerous Danish films throughout the 1920s and 1930s.</p><p>In 1940, Bertelsen moved to the United States where she continued her acting career in Hollywood. She appeared in a number of films including "The Canterville Ghost" (1944), "Blood on the Sun" (1945), and "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (1947). Bertelsen also made several appearances on television shows, including "The Lone Ranger" and "The Adventures of Kit Carson."</p><p>In addition to acting, Bertelsen was also a talented painter and sculptor. She exhibited her artwork in galleries in both the United States and Denmark.</p><p>Bertelsen passed away in Wisconsin in 1977 at the age of 83. She is remembered as a pioneering figure in Danish cinema and a gifted artist.</p><p>Bertelsen was married to Danish actor Johannes Poulsen from 1921 until his death in 1938. The couple had two children together, a son and a daughter. Following Poulsen's death, Bertelsen remarried to Danish writer, director, and producer Svend Methling in 1940, who she had met while working on a film together. Bertelsen and Methling relocated to the United States, where she continued her acting career in Hollywood. Despite being fluent in English, Bertelsen's Danish accent limited the number of roles she could play in American films. However, she still managed to carve out a successful career in film and television. Bertelsen's legacy continues to be honored by film scholars and fans alike for her contributions to Danish cinema and her pioneering work in Hollywood.</p><p>Bertelsen's contributions to Danish cinema were recognized with the award of the Knight's Cross of the Dannebrog Order, one of Denmark's highest honors. She received this award in 1938 for her work in the arts. Bertelsen was also a pioneer for women in the film industry, both in Denmark and Hollywood. She was known for her strong female characters and her willingness to take unconventional roles that challenged traditional gender roles. In addition to her acting and artistic careers, Bertelsen was also active in politics. She was a member of the Social Democratic Party in Denmark and remained politically engaged throughout her life. Her life and career have been the subject of several books and documentaries. Bertelsen's lasting legacy in the entertainment industry is a testament to her talent and determination to succeed in a competitive and male-dominated field.</p><p>Bertelsen's career as an actor spanned over four decades and she made more than 50 films in Denmark and Hollywood. Despite being known for her versatility, she was particularly famous for her comedic roles. Bertelsen starred in "De tre måske fire" (1922) and "Herre og tjenere" (1936), two of the most popular Danish comedies of the time. In Hollywood, she was often cast in supporting roles, playing character parts such as maids, housekeepers, and landladies.</p><p>Bertelsen's achievements as an artist were as remarkable as her success in the film industry. She studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen and continued to paint and sculpt throughout her life. Her talent was recognized by several prestigious galleries in both Denmark and the United States. Bertelsen's artwork was characterized by its expressive, vivid colors and dynamic forms, and she often depicted scenes from nature or everyday life.</p><p>Bertelsen was an early advocate for women's rights and equality. In the 1930s, she co-founded the Danish Women's Society, an organization that fought for women's suffrage, educational opportunities, and improved working conditions. Her involvement in politics and activism was not limited to women's rights, however, and she campaigned for social justice and anti-fascism both in Denmark and the United States.</p><p>Despite facing a number of challenges, including language barriers and gender discrimination, Bertelsen remained committed to pursuing her passions and making a difference in the world. Her legacy as an actor and artist, as well as a progressive activist, continues to inspire generations of women in Denmark and beyond.</p><p>Ingeborg Bruhn Bertelsen was also known for her philanthropy work. She was a generous donor to various charitable organizations, including those that supported the arts, education, and medical research. Bertelsen believed in giving back to society and often used her platform as an actress and artist to raise awareness of social and humanitarian issues. Her humanitarian work earned her several awards, including the Humanitarian Award from the Danish-American Society in 1965. Bertelsen remained active in the arts and politics until her death in 1977, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire and influence people around the world.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-actresses-died-in-1969.html' title='Famous actresses died in 1969'><strong>Famous actresses died in 1969</strong> List of the top 50 Famous actresses who died in 1969</a></li><li><a href='/french-actors-died-at-age-37.html' title='French actors died at age 37'><strong>French actors died at age 37</strong> List of the top 1 French actors who died when they were 37</a></li><li><a href='/american-actresses-died-in-b-cell-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia.html' title='American actresses died in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia'><strong>American actresses died in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia</strong> List of the top 1 American actresses who died in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/finnish-musicians-died-before-turning-40.html' title='Finnish musicians died before turning 40'><strong>Finnish musicians died before turning 40</strong> List of the top 22 Finnish music stars who died before 40</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-actresses-died-at-age-73.html' title='Austrian actresses died at age 73'><strong>Austrian actresses died at age 73</strong> List of the top 2 Austrian actresses who died when they were 73</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actors-died-in-1995.html' title='Indian actors died in 1995'><strong>Indian actors died in 1995</strong> List of the top 7 Indian actors who died in 1995</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
