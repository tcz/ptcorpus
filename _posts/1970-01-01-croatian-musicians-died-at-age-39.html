					</p><p>Bušić was a prominent Croatian nationalist and political activist, known for his involvement in the Croatian diaspora and advocating for Croatian independence from Yugoslavia. He was a member of the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood (HRB), an organization committed to the use of force to achieve Croatian independence. </p><p>After emigrating to the United States, Bušić became the editor of the Croatian Freedom Fighter magazine and a regular speaker at Croatian-American events. In 1976, he was involved in a terrorist attack on the Yugoslav embassy in Stockholm, Sweden, which resulted in the deaths of two Croatian and one Swedish embassy staff. Bušić was sentenced to life in prison, but was released on bail in Paris in 1978 while awaiting an appeal trial. </p><p>Tragically, on October 16, 1978, just days before his appeal trial was scheduled to begin, Bušić and three other Croatians were killed in a car bomb attack in Paris. The attack was later attributed to the Yugoslav secret service, leading to increased tensions between Yugoslavia and Croatian nationalist groups. Bušić continues to be remembered by many as a hero of Croatian independence, and his death is commemorated annually by Croatian nationalist groups.</p><p>Bušić was born in a small village in what is now Croatia. He studied at the University of Zagreb before becoming involved in Croatian nationalism and emigrating to the United States in 1964. There he became a leader in the Croatian-American community and wrote for a number of newspapers and magazines.</p><p>Bušić's involvement in the HRB and the embassy attack in Stockholm brought him international attention and controversy. Some saw him as a freedom fighter for the Croatian cause, while others condemned him as a terrorist. His death only further intensified these debates and the struggle for Croatian independence.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his life, Bušić is remembered by many in Croatia as a symbol of resistance and determination in the pursuit of independence. His legacy and the events of his life continue to be studied and debated by scholars and nationalists alike.</p><p></p><p>
