was
a Brazilian
writer, playwright and poet.


					</p><p>He is most commonly known by his pseudonym, Gonçalves Dias. He is considered one of the most important romantic poets in Brazilian literature. His most famous work is the poem “Canção do Exílio” (Song of Exile). He was also a supporter of Brazilian nationalism and his writing often reflected this. He studied law in Portugal and later became a professor of Latin and history at one of the most prestigious schools in Brazil, the Colégio D. Pedro II. He died at the age of 49 from drowning in the sea near the coast of Africa while on a diplomatic mission representing Brazil. His legacy continues to be celebrated through his influential works that remain popular in Brazilian literature today.</p><p>One of Gonçalves Dias' major contributions to Brazilian literature was his “Indianist” poems, which celebrated the native peoples of Brazil, portraying them as noble and heroic figures. This helped to establish an identity for Brazilian literature, separate from European influences. Dias also wrote several plays, including the historical drama "Leonor de Mendonça" and the comedy "As Professorinhas". In addition to his literary achievements, Dias was also involved in politics, supporting the abolition of slavery in Brazil. His death at sea on a diplomatic mission was a great loss to Brazilian literature and culture, but his impact continues to be felt today through his inspiring and influential works.</p><p></p><p>
