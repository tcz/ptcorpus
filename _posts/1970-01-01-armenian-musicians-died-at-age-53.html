(April 5, 1862		Kayseri-October 20, 1915			Central Anatolia Region)


was
an Armenian
journalist.


					</p><p>Diran Kelekian was born in Kayseri, a city in the central region of Turkey, in 1862. He became a prominent figure in the Armenian community as a journalist and writer, known for his insightful commentary on political and social issues. He worked for several newspapers throughout his career, including the influential Armenian language daily newspaper, Masis. </p><p>Kelekian was an outspoken critic of the Ottoman government's policies towards the Armenian population, particularly during the early 20th century. He was a staunch advocate for Armenian rights, and his writings often exposed the injustices and atrocities committed against the Armenian people. Despite facing censorship and persecution for his views, Kelekian continued to speak out against oppression and championed the cause of Armenian independence. </p><p>Tragically, Kelekian was one of the victims of the Armenian Genocide, which began in 1915. He was arrested by Ottoman authorities and eventually died in captivity. His legacy, however, lives on as a symbol of courage and resilience in the face of injustice. His writings continue to inspire generations of Armenians and others who fight for human rights and social justice.</p><p>Kelekian's contributions to Armenian journalism and literature are considered significant, particularly in the context of the cultural and political challenges faced by the Armenian community during his lifetime. He was not only a journalist but a prolific writer who authored several books and essays, including "The Armenian Question", which critically analyzed the political and social conditions of the Armenian people. Kelekian was also deeply involved in the establishment of Armenian schools and cultural institutions, recognizing the importance of education and cultural identity in preserving the Armenian heritage. His dedication to the Armenian cause and his commitment to social justice continue to inspire people around the world. Kelekian's life and work remind us of the power of resistance and solidarity, even in the darkest of times.</p><p></p><p>
