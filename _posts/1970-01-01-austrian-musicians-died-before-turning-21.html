was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>He was the eleventh child and eighth son of Emperor Joseph I of Austria and his wife Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

(August 7, 1649		Vienna-January 27, 1664			Linz)


was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>He was the second son of Emperor Ferdinand III and his wife Maria Anna of Spain. Archduke Charles Joseph was only 14 years old at the time of his death and therefore did not have the opportunity to make a significant impact on history. However, he was well-educated and was known for his love of music and the arts. His early death was a great loss to the Habsburg family, as he was considered to be one of the most promising heirs to the throne. Despite his short life, Archduke Charles Joseph left a lasting legacy in Austria, and his memory was honored through the naming of numerous buildings and institutions in his honor.</p><p>In addition to his love of music and the arts, Archduke Charles Joseph was also an avid collector of art and books. His extensive collection was dispersed after his death, but many items can still be seen in museums and libraries throughout Austria. And while he may not have had a chance to make a significant impact on history, his death did have political ramifications. With the death of his childless older brother, Ferdinand IV, in 1654, the Habsburg line was left without a clear heir. This led to the War of the Spanish Succession, which ultimately saw the Habsburgs lose their claim to the Spanish throne. Overall, while his life was short, Archduke Charles Joseph's passions and interests live on through the cultural institutions named in his honor.</p><p></p><p>
