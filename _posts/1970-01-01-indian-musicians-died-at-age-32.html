was
an Indian
scientist and mathematician.


					</p><p>He is widely regarded as one of the most influential mathematicians in history, and his contributions to the field are still studied and utilized today. Despite being mostly self-taught in mathematics, Ramanujan developed groundbreaking theorems in number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, among other areas. His work has deeply influenced modern mathematical research, including in fields such as string theory and computer science.

However, due to financial and familial constraints, he was unable to complete his formal education and had to drop out of college. Undeterred, Ramanujan continued to pursue his passion for mathematics and began developing his own mathematical theories. </p><p>In 1913, Ramanujan sent a letter containing some of his results to the renowned British mathematician G.H. Hardy. Hardy was so impressed with Ramanujan's work that he immediately invited him to study at Cambridge University in England. Ramanujan spent five years at Cambridge, collaborating with Hardy and other mathematicians on a wide range of mathematical problems. </p><p>During his lifetime, Ramanujan authored nearly 4,000 mathematical results, many of which were later proven to be correct. Some of his most notable contributions include his work on partition functions, mock theta functions, and Ramanujan's constant. His work also included a formula for calculating the number pi, which helped to revolutionize the field of mathematics. </p><p>Today, Ramanujan is celebrated as a pioneer in the field of mathematics and as a symbol of perseverance and determination. His life and work have inspired countless mathematicians and scientists around the world, and his legacy continues to be felt in the many mathematical breakthroughs that he helped to pave the way for.</p><p></p><p>
