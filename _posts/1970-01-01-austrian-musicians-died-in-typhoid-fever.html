						Franz Schubert was born in a suburb of Vienna, Austria, and was the twelfth child of Franz Theodor Florian Schubert and his wife Maria Elisabeth Katharina Vietz. He showed aptitude for music at an early age and began receiving music education from his father, who was a schoolmaster and amateur musician. Schubert also received keyboard and violin lessons from his older brother Ignaz, and later studied music theory with Antonio Salieri.</p><p>Schubert is known for his extensive contributions to the art song repertoire, producing over 600 Lieder during his short life. He also composed nine symphonies, operas, chamber music, and incidental music. Despite his prolific output, Schubert remained largely unrecognized during his lifetime, struggling to make ends meet as a freelance musician and teacher.</p><p>Only after his death, many of his works were discovered and published by his friends, including Robert Schumann and Franz Liszt, who recognized his genius as a composer. Schubert's music had a significant influence on composers of the Romantic era, such as Johannes Brahms and Gustav Mahler.</p><p>Schubert's life was cut short at the age of 31 due to complications arising from syphilis. He is buried at the Währinger Cemetery in Vienna, where many other famous musicians are also buried.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=44888" title="Wikipedia article about Franz Schubert">Franz Schubert on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/egyptian-musicians-died-at-age-64.html' title='Egyptian musicians died at age 64'><strong>Egyptian musicians died at age 64</strong> List of the top 5 Egyptian music stars who died when they were 64</a></li><li><a href='/colombian-actors-died-in-1986.html' title='Colombian actors died in 1986'><strong>Colombian actors died in 1986</strong> List of the top 1 Colombian actors who died in 1986</a></li><li><a href='/cambodian-actors-died-at-age-55.html' title='Cambodian actors died at age 55'><strong>Cambodian actors died at age 55</strong> List of the top 1 Cambodian actors who died when they were 55</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/dutch-musicians-died-at-age-56.html' title='Dutch musicians died at age 56'><strong>Dutch musicians died at age 56</strong> List of the top 10 Dutch music stars who died when they were 56</a></li><li><a href='/pakistani-actors-died-in-1971.html' title='Pakistani actors died in 1971'><strong>Pakistani actors died in 1971</strong> List of the top 1 Pakistani actors who died in 1971</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-hypertensive-heart-disease.html' title='Famous musicians died in Hypertensive heart disease'><strong>Famous musicians died in Hypertensive heart disease</strong> List of the top 3 Famous music stars who died in Hypertensive heart disease</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
