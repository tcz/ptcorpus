(April 5, 2015		Rutovu-July 16, 1983			Mogadishu)


was
a Burundian
politician.


					</p><p>Micombero served as the President of Burundi from 1966 to 1976, having taken power in a military coup. During his presidency, he was known for his authoritarian tactics, including a crackdown on political opposition and the limitation of press freedom. In 1972, Micombero oversaw a genocide in which an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 Hutus were killed, causing a lasting rift between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups in Burundi. In 1976, he was himself overthrown in a coup d'Ã©tat and went into exile in Somalia until his death in 1983. His legacy remains controversial, with some seeing him as a nationalist hero who sought to unify Burundi and others remembering him for his brutal repression of dissent.</p><p>Micombero was born in Rutovu, Burundi, and received military training in Belgian Congo. He joined the Burundian army in 1961 and quickly rose through the ranks. He became involved in politics and was appointed Minister of National Defense in 1963. Three years later, he led a military coup that overthrew the country's monarchy and established a republic, with Micombero as its president.</p><p>During his presidency, Micombero implemented policies aimed at modernizing and Africanizing Burundi. He introduced Swahili as the national language and nationalized industries and land. However, his authoritarian rule led to increasing discontent among the population. In 1972, he used the pretext of a failed Hutu uprising to launch a campaign of violence against Hutu civilians, resulting in the deaths of thousands.</p><p>Following his overthrow in 1976, Micombero went into exile in Somalia, where he lived until his death in 1983. His regime's legacy has continued to shape Burundi's politics, with the country grappling with instability, ethnic tension, and political violence to this day.</p><p>Micombero's rule also saw Burundi's alignment with China rather than its former colonizer, Belgium. This shift in foreign policy helped to modernize the country but also resulted in economic difficulties due to China's Cultural Revolution. Micombero's regime also enacted policies that favored the Tutsi ethnic group, leading to tensions and discrimination against the Hutu majority. Micombero's exile in Somalia saw him living in relative obscurity, with little involvement in politics. His death in 1983 was reportedly due to a heart attack. While his legacy remains divisive, his presidency is often cited as a key factor in the country's ongoing struggles with violence and instability.</p><p>Micombero's legacy also includes his contribution to Burundi's infrastructure development during his presidency. He initiated construction projects for roads, schools, hospitals, and other public amenities. He also established partnerships with neighboring countries to build regional infrastructure, such as highways and transportation links. However, his policies did little to address the country's economic problems or improve the standard of living for ordinary citizens.</p><p>After his overthrow, Burundi experienced a period of political turmoil and violence, with various factions vying for power. Micombero's regime had left the country deeply divided along ethnic lines, with Tutsis mainly supporting his policies and Hutus feeling sidelined and oppressed. This led to a cycle of ethnic violence that has plagued the country ever since.</p><p>In recent years, Burundi has made some progress towards peace and stability, but challenges remain. The country is still dealing with the legacy of Micombero's presidency, including issues of ethnic discrimination, political oppression, and economic inequality.</p><p></p><p>
