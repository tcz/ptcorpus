									</h1><p>Here are 6 famous musicians from Germany died at 46:</p><h2>Otto Brunfels</h2><p><strong>Otto Brunfels</strong>
(April 5, 1488		Mainz-November 23, 1534			Bern)


was
a German
botanist.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the "fathers of botany" for his significant contributions to the field. Brunfels studied medicine and theology before working as a parish priest, but his passion for botany led him to publish several influential works on the subject. His most famous book, "Herbarum vivae eicones," was published in 1530 and included detailed illustrations and descriptions of over 400 plants. Brunfels' botanical research and publications helped establish botany as a separate scientific discipline and paved the way for future advancements in the field.</p><p></p><p>

(February 4, 1774		Großenhain-July 11, 1820			Montreal)


was
a German
botanist.


					</p><p>He was influenced by botanist Johann Jacob Roemer and the famous poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe to pursue his interest in botany. Pursh is best known for his extensive work in North America where he documented and collected over 100 new species of plants. He is especially renowned for his classification of many new genera of flowering plants, such as the now-popular goldenrod (Solidago) and the lupine (Lupinus). Pursh's only published work, titled "Flora Americae Septentrionalis," is considered to be an important contribution to botanical literature. Sadly, Pursh was impoverished during the latter years of his life, and he passed away in Montreal at the age of 46, leaving behind a legacy of botanical discoveries that continue to be studied and appreciated today.</p><p></p><p>

(October 3, 1898		Bad Ems-October 20, 1944			Plötzensee Prison)


was
a German
economist.


					</p><p>Not only was Adolf Reichwein an economist, but he was also a German educator, cultural policymaker, and social philosopher. He initially studied law and political science, but later shifted to economics. Reichwein actively promoted adult education and democracy in Germany, even during the Nazi period. He spoke out against the dehumanizing effects of the dictatorship, which ultimately led to his execution by the Nazis in 1944. Reichwein was involved in the German resistance and was a close associate of Claus von Stauffenberg, who attempted to assassinate Hitler in July 1944.</p><p></p><p>

(May 23, 1900		Karlsruhe-October 16, 1946			Nuremberg)


was
a German
lawyer and politician.


					
			
		He had
		five
		children,
		Sigrid Frank, Norman Frank, Brigitte Frank, Michael Frank and Niklas Frank.

						</p><p>Hans Frank was a prominent figure in Nazi Germany, serving as the Governor-General of occupied Poland during World War II. Prior to his involvement with the Nazi Party, Frank was a successful lawyer and member of the German National People's Party. He joined the Nazi Party in 1927 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a close friend and confidant of Adolf Hitler. </p><p>As Governor-General of Poland, Frank oversaw the implementation of policies that led to the deaths of millions of people, including Jews, Roma, and ethnic Poles. He was known for his ruthless and brutal tactics, and his administration was responsible for the establishment of ghettos, mass deportations, and the construction of concentration and extermination camps. </p><p>After the war, Frank was captured by Allied forces and brought to trial at the Nuremberg Trials. He was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by hanging. In his final statement, he expressed remorse for his actions and acknowledged the devastating toll that his administration had taken on the people of Poland. However, many viewed this as a last-ditch effort to save himself from the gallows. His legacy remains controversial to this day, with some viewing him as a vile and evil figure, and others as a tragic and flawed individual caught up in the horrors of war.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by hanging.

a German
surgeon.

Gruentzig first performed the procedure in 1977, and it quickly gained popularity as a less invasive alternative to coronary bypass surgery. He later developed new types of catheters and balloons to improve the procedure's effectiveness, and his work revolutionized the field of cardiology. Sadly, Gruentzig died at the age of 46 in a plane crash while traveling to a medical conference. His contributions to medicine have been widely recognized, and he has been honored with numerous awards and accolades.</p><p></p><p>
