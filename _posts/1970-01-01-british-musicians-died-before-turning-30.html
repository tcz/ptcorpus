was
a British
soldier, writer and poet.


					</p><p>During World War I, Wilfred Owen served as a Lieutenant in the British Army and was known for his vivid and realistic war poetry. Some of his most notable works include "Anthem for Doomed Youth" and "Dulce et Decorum Est". Owen's poetry often shed light on the harsh realities of war and the psychological toll it takes on soldiers. After being diagnosed with shell shock, he was sent to recover in Edinburgh, where he met fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon, who had a significant influence on his writing. Despite his brief career, Wilfred Owen remains one of the most celebrated British poets of the 20th century.</p><p>Before the outbreak of World War I, Owen worked as a teacher and later as a private tutor. He was a devout Christian and briefly considered becoming a clergyman, but his experiences in the war led him to question his faith. In 1917, he was sent to France to fight on the Western Front, where he witnessed the horrors of trench warfare firsthand. He was wounded in battle and spent several months recovering before returning to the front lines. </p><p>Owen's poetry was heavily influenced by his experiences in the war and his conversations with fellow soldiers, many of whom he saw die in battle. He wrote about the physical and emotional pain of war, the senselessness of violence, and the impact of war on soldiers and civilians alike. His work was not well-known during his lifetime, but after his death, his poems were published and became widely read. Today, he is considered one of the greatest war poets in English literature.</p><p></p><p>

		a.k.a. H. G. J. Moseley

	
was
a British
physicist and engineer.


					</p><p>Moseley made significant contributions to the field of physics, particularly in the area of atomic theory. His most notable achievement was the development of Moseley's law, which established a relationship between the wavelengths of X-rays emitted by atoms and their atomic numbers. This law provided a key to the puzzle of atomic structure and helped lay the foundation for the development of quantum mechanics.</p><p>Moseley's untimely death at the age of 27 during World War I cut short a promising career, but his contributions to physics continue to be studied and celebrated today. His work helped to usher in a new era in the field of atomic physics, and his legacy has inspired generations of physicists to pursue groundbreaking research in the years since his passing.</p><p>Moseley was born into a family of scientists, as his father was also a physicist. He attended Trinity College, Oxford, where he developed a deep interest in physics and chemistry. After completing his studies, he joined the team of renowned physicist Ernest Rutherford at the University of Manchester, where he conducted groundbreaking research on the properties of atoms.</p><p>It was during his time at Manchester that Moseley made his most significant contribution to the field of physics, developing his law that revolutionized atomic theory. Moseley's work also helped to confirm the existence of protons, a fundamental particle of the atom.</p><p>In addition to his scientific achievements, Moseley was also recognized for his bravery and selflessness during World War I. Despite the opportunity to pursue a safe position in the military, he instead chose to serve on the front lines, ultimately sacrificing his life in the conflict.</p><p>Today, Moseley is remembered as one of the most brilliant physicists of his time, and his contributions to the field continue to shape our understanding of the universe.</p><p></p><p>

(February 22, 1903		Cambridge-January 19, 1930)

	
		also known as Frank Ramsey or Frank Plumpton Ramsey

	
was
a British
economist, philosopher, mathematician and scientist.


					</p><p>Ramsey made significant contributions to multiple fields during his short life, including philosophy, logic, mathematics, and economics. He is best known for his work in logic, where he developed the theory of truth that is now known as the redundancy theory. This theory suggests that in order to understand what is meant by a sentence, one simply needs to understand the relations between the words in that sentence.</p><p>In the field of economics, Ramsey was a pioneer of intertemporal analysis, which studies how people make decisions over time. His contributions to this area helped lay the foundation for modern macroeconomics. Ramsey also made important contributions to decision theory, which studies how people make decisions under conditions of uncertainty.</p><p>Ramsey's work in mathematics included the development of the Ramsey theory, which studies the conditions for the existence of a certain type of structure within a larger object. This work has important applications in computer science, combinatorics, and graph theory.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Ramsey's life was tragically cut short by jaundice at the age of only 26. Nonetheless, his contributions to a variety of fields have continued to influence research for decades after his death.</p><p>Ramsey grew up in a highly academic family - his father was a mathematician and president of Magdalene College, Cambridge, while his mother was a suffragist and social activist. Ramsey himself showed signs of intellectual brilliance at an early age, publishing his first paper in mathematics at the age of just 17. He went on to study at Cambridge, where he became a close friend of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.</p><p>Ramsey's work in philosophy was highly influential, particularly in the areas of semantics and metaphysics. He argued that truth is a property of whole propositions rather than individual statements, and he developed the notion of a ramified hierarchy to explain the logical relations between propositions.</p><p>Ramsey's contributions to economics were similarly ground-breaking. He developed the concept of optimal taxation, which seeks to balance the revenue-generating potential of taxation with the economic costs of raising taxes. He also formulated the idea of a Ramsey rule, which helps policymakers determine the optimal rate of consumption in an economy.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Ramsey was known for his modesty and humility, and he remained relatively unknown outside academic circles during his lifetime. It was only after his death that his work began to receive the recognition it deserved. Today, Ramsey's contributions to fields as diverse as philosophy, economics, and mathematics continue to inspire research and scholarship around the world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by jaundice.

In 1941, he joined the British Armed Forces to fight in World War II. During his time in the forces, he served in North Africa, Italy and Greece. He also wrote extensively about his experiences in his poetry. Keyes’ poetry reflected the horrors of war and explored the theme of young men going to fight for their country. Keyes' work was widely acclaimed and he became one of the leading voices of the World War II generation. Tragically, he was killed in action in 1943, aged just 20 years old. Despite his young age and short career, Keyes’ poetry had a profound impact on the literary world and continues to influence contemporary poets today.</p><p>One of Sidney Keyes' most famous works was his collection of poems titled "The Cruel Solstice," published in 1943 shortly before his death. The collection included poems that expressed his disillusionment with war and his struggle to find meaning in it, as well as reflections on his own mortality as a soldier. Keyes was also known for his friendship with fellow poet Keith Douglas, who was also a soldier and died in battle. The two corresponded through poetry and their shared experiences of war, which influenced both of their works. Keyes' legacy as a poet and soldier is celebrated by the Sidney Keyes Memorial Trust, which awards an annual prize for poetry in his honor.</p><p></p><p>
