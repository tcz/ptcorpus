(April 5, 2015		Kangwon Province-December 12, 2013			Pyongyang)

	
		also known as Chang Sung-taek, Chang Sŏngt&#039;aek or Jang Seong-taek

	
was
a North Korean
politician.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Jang Kum-song.

						</p><p>Jang Sung-taek was married to Kim Kyong-hui, the younger sister of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. He was considered a close confidant of current North Korean leader Kim Jong-un until his arrest in 2013. Jang held numerous high-level positions in the North Korean government, including Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission, which was the country's top military body at the time. His arrest and subsequent execution sent shockwaves throughout North Korea and around the world. Some experts believe that Jang's execution was the result of a power struggle within the North Korean government, while others point to alleged corruption and other crimes as the reason for his downfall.</p><p>Jang Sung-taek's political career started in the early 1970s, when he became a close friend and associate of Kim Jong-il. In 1992, he was appointed as the director of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) Organization and Guidance Department, a powerful position responsible for overseeing propaganda and ideological education. He held this position until 2004, and during his tenure, he played a significant role in consolidating Kim Jong-il's grip on power.</p><p>In 2010, Jang became a vital figure in the North Korean government when he was appointed as the Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission. He was also elected as a member of the political bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee, becoming one of the most powerful figures in the country's political hierarchy.</p><p>Jang was known for his unusually close relationship with his nephew, Kim Jong-un, who succeeded his father Kim Jong-il as North Korea's leader in 2011. Jang's role in the new regime was seen as crucial, as he was tasked with managing the country's economic reform program and played a significant role in building economic ties with China.</p><p>However, in December 2013, Jang was purged from the North Korean government, arrested, and accused of various charges, including corruption, womanizing, and drug use. He was also accused of trying to overthrow the government and replace Kim Jong-un as the country's leader. Jang was swiftly tried and executed by firing squad less than a week later, marking one of the most significant political purges in North Korean history.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of capital punishment.

(April 5, 2015		Vyatskoye, Khabarovsk Krai-April 5, 2015			Pyongyang)


was
a North Korean
personality.


					</p><p>Kim Man-il was a former personal secretary of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's aunt, Kim Kyong-hui. He was also believed to be the head of a trading company, linking North Korea with other countries. His death was surrounded by mystery and speculation as he was reportedly purged by the North Korean regime for charges of corruption or spilling state secrets. His body was found in the Taedong River in Pyongyang, which led to questions about whether he was pushed into the river or chose to end his life instead. Despite this, the North Korean government denied any foul play in his death.</p><p>Kim Man-il's death was not the first high-profile death in North Korea associated with its ruler's sweeping purges of officials. Before him, Kim Jong-un's own uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was executed on charges of treason in 2013. Like Jang, Kim Man-il's familiarity with the workings of the secretive and tightly controlled regime in North Korea made his final fate of much interest to foreign intelligence agencies. Prior to his untimely death, Kim Man-il had reportedly acted as a business liaison between North Korea and China, and was rumored to have been involved in smuggling activities as well. However, relatively little is known about his life, given the country's strict control over information, and much of what has been written about him is based on rumors and speculation.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of drowning.
