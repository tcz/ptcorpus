(May 21, 1960		West Allis-November 28, 1994			Portage)

	
		also known as Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer

	
was
an American
criminal.


					</p><p>Dahmer became notorious for committing the rape, murder, and dismemberment of 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. He often cannibalized parts of his victims and kept body parts as souvenirs. He was finally caught in 1991 after one of his intended victims managed to escape and alert the police. Dahmer pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to 15 life terms in prison. While in prison, he was beaten to death by a fellow inmate in 1994. Dahmer's case remains one of the most infamous in American criminal history.</p><p>Dahmer had a troubled childhood, and struggled with alcoholism and feelings of isolation throughout his life. He dropped out of Ohio State University after just one semester due to poor grades, and soon after, he began committing his first murders. After his arrest, Dahmer underwent a series of psychiatric evaluations and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and necrophilia. He attempted to seek help and even expressed remorse for his actions, but ultimately, his sentence was carried out. His case sparked a national conversation about mental illness and the criminal justice system. Today, Dahmer's crimes continue to fascinate and horrify people around the world.</p><p>Attempts were made to understand the mind of such a heinous killer. Authorities confirmed that Dahmer was also greatly affected by his parent's divorce when he was just 18 years old. Before the killings began, Dahmer would often pick up random hitchhikers for fleeting sexual encounters, which later escalated to murder. Following his capture, a search of his apartment revealed several horrific objects, including human remains that he had kept, decomposing body parts, a human head in the refrigerator, and several photographs of his victims. Dahmer's victims were mostly below the age of 30 and included a mix of racial backgrounds. Today, a monument exists at the site where Dahmer was killed in prison, although it remains a controversial site of interest for many people.</p><p>Dahmer's crimes had a lasting impact on both his victims' families and American society at large. He was known as the "Milwaukee Cannibal" and his case remains a subject of fascination and discussion in the media, including books, documentaries, and even movies. Dahmer's story has been the subject of numerous urban legends and myths, many of which are not true. The city of Milwaukee, where the majority of his crimes took place, has since worked to distance itself from the infamous serial killer.</p><p>In the years following Dahmer's death, many questions have been raised about his motivations and the social and cultural factors that may have contributed to his actions. His crimes have been studied extensively by criminal psychologists, and some have suggested that his alcoholism and deep-seated feelings of loneliness and isolation played a significant role in his crimes. Others have pointed to his troubled childhood and the trauma of his parents' divorce as possible factors.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, Dahmer's crimes remain a stark reminder of the horrors that human beings are capable of committing. His story has been a cautionary tale, warning against the dangers of unchecked mental illness and the need to take seriously the warning signs of dangerous behavior in others. Today, the memory of Dahmer's victims lives on, as loved ones continue to mourn their loss and the world at large struggles to come to terms with the tragedy that he inflicted.</p><p>It is worth noting that Dahmer's case also sparked discussions about the issue of police negligence and the LGBT+ community's lack of protection from hate crimes. Many of Dahmer's victims were gay or bisexual men, and some had reported him to the police prior to their deaths, but their claims were not taken seriously. The mishandling of these cases highlighted the need for increased awareness and sensitivity in law enforcement towards marginalized communities.</p><p>Additionally, Dahmer's case has been referenced in debates surrounding the death penalty. Despite the severity of his crimes, some argue that the death penalty is an inhumane and ineffective form of punishment, while others believe that he deserved the ultimate punishment for his actions.</p><p>Overall, Jeffrey Dahmer's life and crimes continue to have a significant impact on American culture and society. His story serves as a reminder of the dangers of untreated mental illness, the need for improved policing practices, and the devastating effects of hate crimes towards marginalized communities.</p><p>It is also important to note that after Dahmer's death, his brain was studied by scientists in an attempt to understand the underlying causes of his actions. The results of the study showed that he had a significantly smaller prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making, impulse control and empathy. This finding has led some to believe that Dahmer may have had a neurological disorder or brain injury that contributed to his violent behavior.</p><p>Another aspect of Dahmer's legacy is the ongoing debate about the ethics of true crime media. Despite the heinous nature of his crimes, they have been the subject of numerous books, documentaries, and even a Hollywood movie. Some feel that this type of media glorifies serial killers and subjects their victims to further exploitation, while others believe that it is important to study these cases in order to better understand the minds of criminals and prevent similar crimes from happening in the future.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his life and crimes, one thing is certain: Jeffrey Dahmer's actions were undeniably horrific and had a profound impact on those he victimized and society as a whole. His story serves as a reminder that evil exists, and that it is our responsibility as humans to work towards preventing such tragedies from occurring in the future.</p><p></p><p>

was
an American
novelist and writer.


					</p><p>Kornbluth was best known for his science fiction writing, which included the classic short story "The Marching Morons" and the novel "The Space Merchants," which he co-wrote with Frederik Pohl. He also worked as an editor and wrote non-fiction articles on a variety of topics, including politics and economics. Kornbluth was a member of the Futurians, a group of science fiction fans and writers who were influential in the development of the genre. He died at the young age of 34 from a heart attack. Despite his short career, Kornbluth left behind a lasting legacy as one of the most important voices in 20th century science fiction.</p><p>Kornbluth's writing often explored social and political themes, using science fiction as a framework to critique various aspects of modern society. In addition to "The Space Merchants," Kornbluth also co-wrote several other novels with Frederik Pohl, including "Gladiator-At-Law" and "Wolfbane." He also wrote a number of solo works, such as "Not This August" and "The Syndic." Kornbluth's work had a significant impact on the genre of science fiction, and he influenced many other writers who followed in his footsteps. In 1990, he was awarded a posthumous induction into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.</p><p>Kornbluth was born to Jewish immigrant parents who had fled persecution in Russia. He was a precocious child who skipped several grades in school and began writing at an early age. After high school, Kornbluth served in the Army during World War II, which had a profound influence on his writing. His experiences in the military informed his views on war and society, and many of his stories dealt with the aftermath of conflict and the psychology of soldiers.</p><p>After the war, Kornbluth attended the University of Chicago, where he became friends with fellow science fiction writers and enthusiasts, including Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein. As a member of the Futurians, Kornbluth participated in science fiction conventions and helped launch the careers of several prominent writers.</p><p>Throughout his career, Kornbluth struggled with alcoholism and financial difficulties. Despite these challenges, he continued to write prolifically and was highly regarded by his peers. His unique blend of satire, social commentary, and science fiction influenced several generations of writers and helped establish science fiction as a serious literary genre.</p><p>Today, Kornbluth is considered one of the most innovative and influential science fiction writers of his time. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of writers and readers alike.</p><p>Kornbluth's work also had a significant impact on the world of film and TV. Several of his stories, such as "The Marching Morons" and "The Little Black Bag," were adapted into popular episodes of "The Twilight Zone" and other sci-fi TV shows. In addition, his novel "The Space Merchants" was optioned for a film adaptation in the early 1960s, but the project was ultimately never completed.</p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Kornbluth's influence on science fiction is still felt today. His writing explored complex themes like political corruption, consumerism, and militarism, paving the way for future writers to interrogate these same issues in their own work. His legacy also continues through his collaborations with Frederik Pohl, which produced some of the most enduring works of science fiction in the 20th century. Overall, Kornbluth's life and work serve as a reminder of the power of science fiction to challenge and inspire us, both as individuals and as a society.</p><p>Kornbluth's impact on science fiction cannot be overstated. His writing was distinct for its ability to comment on contemporary social and political issues while also imagining worlds far beyond our own. Many of his stories explored the unintended consequences of technological progress, a theme that has continued to resonate in science fiction to this day. Kornbluth also contributed to the creation of the "fix-up" novel, a form of science fiction in which previously published stories are combined into a single volume. </p><p>In addition to his contributions to science fiction writing, Kornbluth also worked as an editor for various publishing houses, including Galaxy Science Fiction and Ballantine Books. As an editor, he mentored several young writers who would go on to become important figures in the genre, including Judith Merril and Harlan Ellison.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Kornbluth's work continues to be read and critically acclaimed. His writing has been the subject of scholarly study, and his books continue to be reissued and anthologized. Kornbluth's creativity, innovation, and unique perspective ensured his place in the pantheon of science fiction greats.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to science fiction literature, Kornbluth also wrote for the stage and screen. He was involved in the production of several TV shows, including the popular series "Captain Video and His Video Rangers." Kornbluth also wrote several plays, including "Machinal," which was produced on Broadway in 1928 and won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. </p><p>Kornbluth's political views were also an important aspect of his writing. He was a leftist and a strong advocate for social justice and equality. Many of his stories criticized capitalism and consumerism, and he often explored the impacts of these systems on society and the individual. Kornbluth's beliefs also led him to become involved in left-wing political movements, such as the Anti-Fascist Committee for a Free Germany. </p><p>Despite his achievements, Kornbluth's life was marked by personal struggles. He suffered from financial difficulties, health problems, and alcoholism throughout his career. These challenges likely contributed to his premature death at the age of 34. Despite these hardships, Kornbluth's contributions to science fiction and literature continue to be celebrated and studied today.</p><p></p><p>
