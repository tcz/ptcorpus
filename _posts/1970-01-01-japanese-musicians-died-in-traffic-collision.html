(July 18, 1919		Yokohama-October 27, 1958			Hertfordshire)

	
		a.k.a. Dim, John De Lacy Wooldridge or Wing Commander John De Lacy Wooldridge, DSO, DFC and Bar, DFM

	
was
a Japanese
film score composer and pilot.


					
			
		He had
		three
		children,
		Susan Wooldridge, Hugh Wooldridge and Morris Latham.

						</p><p>Wooldridge was born in Yokohama, Japan to English parents, and was educated at Marlborough College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He joined the Royal Air Force in 1939 and became a fighter pilot during World War II. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar, and Distinguished Flying Medal for his services during the war.</p><p>After the war, Wooldridge studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London and became a film score composer. He composed music for several Japanese films, including Tokyo Joe (1949) and The Throne of Blood (1957). He also composed the score for the British film The Birthday Present (1957).</p><p>Wooldridge died in a car crash in Hertfordshire, England in 1958, at the age of 39. He is remembered as a talented pilot and composer, who made significant contributions to both fields during his short life.</p><p>In addition to his achievements as a pilot and composer, Wooldridge was also a skilled linguist, fluent in English, Japanese, Chinese and Russian. During his time in Japan, he became interested in the culture and language, and even gave lectures on Japanese language and history at the Royal Academy of Music. </p><p>Wooldridge's daughter, Susan Wooldridge, followed in his footsteps and became an actress, best known for her roles in the films Another Country and Howards End. Hugh Wooldridge is a theatre director and producer, while Morris Latham is an artist.</p><p>Though his life was cut short, Wooldridge's legacy lives on through his music and the impact he had on the Royal Air Force during World War II. He remains a respected figure in both the aviation and film industries.</p><p>Wooldridge was known for his bravery and exceptional flying skills during World War II. He flew with the RAF's famed No. 43 Squadron and was one of the top scorers with 16 enemy planes shot down. He was also involved in the D-Day operations, providing air support to the ground troops. After the war, he continued to serve with the RAF and was on active duty during the Malayan Emergency in the late 1940s.</p><p>In addition to his film scores, Wooldridge also composed classical music and his works have been performed by major orchestras, including the London Symphony Orchestra. Despite his success in both aviation and music, he remained a modest person, never seeking the limelight.</p><p>Wooldridge was also an accomplished athlete, having played rugby for both the RAF and Marlborough College. He was also an avid skier and mountaineer, and climbed Mount Fuji during his time in Japan.</p><p>In honor of his contributions to aviation, the John Wooldridge Trophy is awarded annually to the "Best of Best" fighter squadron in the RAF.</p><p>Wooldridge's interest in music began at a young age, as he played the piano and violin. He continued to study music throughout his life, and even considered pursuing a career as a concert pianist before deciding to join the Royal Air Force. Despite his success as a film score composer, he often struggled to balance his love of music with his duties as a pilot. He once remarked, "It's difficult to be a serious musician and a professional airman at the same time." </p><p>While serving in the RAF, Wooldridge became known for his skill at formation flying, which he attributed to his background in music. He once said, "It's like being part of an orchestra. You have to know your part and play it perfectly, while also blending in with the rest of the group." </p><p>In addition to his music and military careers, Wooldridge was also a devoted family man. He married his wife, Angela, in 1943 and the couple had three children together. Despite the demands of his work, he made sure to spend as much time with his family as possible. His daughter Susan has spoken fondly of her memories of her father, describing him as "the most wonderful, loving, intelligent father you could ever wish for."</p><p>Wooldridge's legacy continues to be celebrated today, both through the John Wooldridge Trophy and through performances of his music. His compositions have been praised for their beauty and emotional depth, and his bravery as a pilot has inspired countless others to follow in his footsteps. Though he may have passed away too soon, his contributions to both music and aviation will never be forgotten.</p><p></p><p>
