After the fall of Saddam's regime, Sabawi went into hiding but was eventually captured by the US military and handed over to the Iraqi authorities. He was then put on trial and sentenced to death. He denied any involvement in human rights abuses committed by the regime and claimed that he had been working on his own to promote economic development in Iraq.
