(April 5, 1491		Bonaduz-September 6, 1529			Klausen, South Tyrol)


was
a Swiss
personality.


					</p><p>He was a renowned and influential figure in the Anabaptist movement, which was a Protestant religious group that emerged in the 16th century. Blaurock was originally a Roman Catholic priest, but he converted to Anabaptism and became a prominent leader of the movement in Switzerland. He is known for his fiery preaching and unwavering commitment to his beliefs, which often led to persecution and even death. Blaurock played a key role in spreading Anabaptism throughout Europe, particularly in Germany and Austria. He was eventually martyred for his beliefs in 1529, when he was burned at the stake in Klausen, South Tyrol. Despite his relatively short life, Blaurock's legacy has endured and he is remembered as a significant figure in the Protestant Reformation.</p><p>Blaurock was born in the village of Bonaduz, in what is now Switzerland. He was trained as a priest and served in various churches in Switzerland before coming into contact with the Anabaptist movement. Blaurock was deeply troubled by what he saw as corruption and hypocrisy in the Catholic Church and was drawn to the radical teachings of the Anabaptists, who rejected infant baptism and believed in the separation of church and state. </p><p>In 1525, Blaurock was baptized by Conrad Grebel, another prominent Anabaptist leader, in what is considered the first adult baptism of the movement. From then on, Blaurock became an active and outspoken advocate for Anabaptism, using his powerful preaching skills to convert many to the movement. He also played a key role in organizing local Anabaptist communities and establishing networks between different groups. </p><p>Blaurock's influence extended beyond Switzerland, as he traveled throughout Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands, spreading the message of Anabaptism and helping to establish new communities. His tireless efforts led to him being persecuted and imprisoned multiple times, but he remained steadfast in his beliefs, even while facing death. </p><p>On September 6, 1529, Blaurock was burned at the stake in Klausen, South Tyrol, along with several other Anabaptists. His death was a significant event in the history of the movement, serving as a rallying cry for many of his followers and strengthening their commitment to the cause. Blaurock's legacy continues to inspire those who value religious freedom and the right to worship according to one's own beliefs.</p><p>Blaurock's impact on Anabaptism is hard to overstate. He was instrumental in shaping the theology and practices of the movement, and his teachings continue to influence Anabaptist communities around the world. Blaurock also left behind a significant body of writings, including hymns, prayers, and theological treatises. His most famous work is the hymn "We Sing An Anthem High," which is still sung in Anabaptist churches today. In addition to his religious activities, Blaurock was also involved in social justice issues, advocating for economic equality and opposing the use of violence. His commitment to nonviolence was a major influence on the philosophy of the Anabaptist movement, which has a long history of pacifism. Blaurock's life and legacy serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up for one's beliefs, even in the face of extreme adversity.</p><p></p><p>
