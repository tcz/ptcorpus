					</p><p>He was a founding member of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and played a significant role in the fight for Angolan independence from Portugal. Pinto de Andrade was a writer and poet who used his literary talents to promote anticolonialism and African culture. After Angola gained independence in 1975, he served as the country's first ambassador to the United Nations.

Pinto de Andrade led the MPLA's first armed resistance in northern Angola, but was eventually captured and imprisoned by the Portuguese authorities for nine years.</p><p>During his time in prison, Pinto de Andrade wrote extensively, including a seminal text on African nationalism and culture, which became a key influence on anti-colonial movements across the continent. After his release in 1960, he went into exile in Morocco and continued to work with the MPLA, advocating for Angolan independence on the international stage.</p><p>Pinto de Andrade served as Angola's first ambassador to the United Nations after it gained independence in 1975. However, his critical stance towards the MPLA government led to his dismissal in 1980, after which he went into exile once again. He spent much of his exile in London, where he continued to campaign for democracy and human rights in Angola and remained an influential figure in the country's political and cultural landscape.</p><p>Pinto de Andrade's contributions to the struggle for Angolan independence and his advocacy for African culture and nationalism continue to inspire generations of activists and intellectuals across the continent.</p><p>Throughout his life, Pinto de Andrade devoted himself to promoting the cultural and political rights of African people. In addition to his involvement in the MPLA, he co-founded the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) and was a member of the Pan-African Congress. He was a prolific writer and poet, publishing works such as "The Return of the Black Magus" and "African Culture and the Colonial Situation," which emphasized the importance of African traditions and customs in the fight against colonialism.</p><p>Pinto de Andrade was also known for his dedication to human rights and democracy, speaking out against the authoritarianism of the MPLA government he helped create. He played a key role in the formation of the Angolan National Union and continued to advocate for democratic reforms and free elections in Angola during his exile.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to Angolan independence and the broader struggle against colonialism and imperialism, Pinto de Andrade has been honored by numerous institutions, including the University of Luanda, which established the Mario Pinto de Andrade Prize for African Literature in his memory.</p><p></p><p>
