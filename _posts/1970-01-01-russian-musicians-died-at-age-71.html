In 1918, he was appointed Hetman of Ukraine, a position equivalent to a monarch, during a brief period of independence for Ukraine.

Many Ukrainians viewed him as an illegitimate leader who had been imposed on them by foreign powers, and his pro-German policies were deeply unpopular. Skoropadskyi also faced opposition from socialists and other left-wing groups, who accused him of being a reactionary figure who sought to return Ukraine to an outdated form of feudalism.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Pavlo Skoropadskyi was also a noted military commander. He served in the Russian army during World War I and was awarded several medals for his service. Skoropadskyi also served as a member of the Council of Generals during the interim government that ruled Ukraine following the fall of the Russian Empire.</p><p>After his exile, Skoropadskyi continued to be active in Ukrainian nationalist circles. He wrote several books on Ukrainian history and culture and maintained ties with exiled Ukrainian politicians and activists. Skoropadskyi's legacy remains controversial in Ukraine today, with some viewing him as a patriotic leader who sought to modernize the country, while others see him as a figure who collaborated with foreign powers and stood in the way of Ukrainian independence.</p><p></p><p>
