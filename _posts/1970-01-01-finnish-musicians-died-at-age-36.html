(October 26, 1888		Helsinki-September 29, 1925			Helsinki)

	
		otherwise known as Ernst Runar Schildt

	
was
a Finnish
author and writer.


					</p><p>Schildt was a prolific writer, producing poetry, essays, and novels in both Swedish and Finnish. He was known for his modernist and experimental style, which often explored themes of individualism, the human condition, and the complex relationships between people. Some of his most famous works include "Äventyr" (1922), "Tårar öfver Europa" (1924), and "Smeds och andra noveller" (1918). In addition to his writing, Schildt was also an avid art collector and patron, supporting emerging Finnish artists and helping to establish the Helsinki Artists' Association. Unfortunately, Schildt's life was cut short at the age of 37, when he died of tuberculosis. Despite his relatively short career, Schildt's contributions to Finnish and international literature continue to be celebrated today.</p><p>Throughout his life, Schildt was recognized for his contributions to the arts. He won the State Literature Prize in 1924 and was elected to the Finnish Literature Society in 1925, the same year as his death. Schildt's legacy has continued to inspire Finnish literature, with the Runar Schildt Award being established in his honor to recognize Finnish writers. Many of his works have been translated into other languages, making his impact on modernist literature even more widespread. His personal collection of art was also bequeathed to the Finnish National Gallery, where it remains a significant part of the national art collection. Schildt's life and writing continue to be celebrated for their innovation, depth, and beauty.</p><p>Schildt's upbringing in Helsinki was one of privilege, as his family was part of the Finnish Swedish-speaking upper class. He studied at the University of Helsinki, where he initially pursued a degree in medicine before transitioning to literature. Schildt's literary career began with the publication of his first collection of poems, "Agnes" in 1916. His writing was heavily influenced by his travels to India and Sri Lanka in the early 1920s, which inspired his later work that grappled with themes of colonialism and cultural exchange.</p><p>In addition to his writing and art collecting, Schildt was also involved in politics, specifically the Social Democratic Party, which represented the working class. He was dismayed by the political climate of the time, which he felt was marked by social inequality and the dominance of the upper class. Schildt's political views were reflected in his writing, which often criticized the societal norms of the upper class and their impact on the working class.</p><p>Schildt's literary contributions were not confined to his own writing, as he also served as a literary critic for several newspapers and magazines, including Helsingin Sanomat and Parnasso. His insightful commentary and discerning eye helped to shape the literary scene of his time, and his influence can still be felt today in the realm of Finnish literature.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Schildt's literary and artistic legacy has endured, with his contributions to the Finnish cultural scene continuing to inspire and influence new generations of writers and artists.</p><p>It is worth adding that Schildt's work was not only popular in Finland but was also recognized internationally, particularly in Sweden where he was highly regarded. Despite the fact that he wrote in both Swedish and Finnish, his readership spanned across language boundaries. In fact, Schildt was considered one of the most important modernists Scandinavia had produced at the time. </p><p>Schildt's travels to India and Sri Lanka also influenced his involvement in the Theosophical Society, a movement that sought to promote spiritualism and the idea of a universal brotherhood of humankind. This interest in spiritualism is evident in some of his writing, particularly in his novel "Tårar öfver Europa", which depicts the breakdown of traditional societal structures and the search for meaning in a changing world.</p><p>Schildt's personal life was marked by tragedy, as his wife and daughter both died young, leaving him to raise their son alone. This personal loss is reflected in some of his writing, which explores themes of grief and loss. Schildt's own battle with tuberculosis, which ultimately took his life, also influenced his work. His writing often dealt with the fragility of life and the inevitability of death, a theme that was particularly poignant given his own struggles with illness.</p><p>Schildt's contributions to the arts and literature were not limited to his written works and art collecting. He was also an active member of the theater scene in Helsinki, both as a playwright and an actor. He wrote several plays throughout his career, including "Vid en skilsmässomiddag" (At a Divorce Party) and "Nero och hans mödrar" (Nero and His Mothers). Schildt's involvement in the theater helped to further develop his experimental and modernist style, as he explored new ways of storytelling and character development. His work as an actor, which included roles in plays by fellow Finnish writers such as Hella Wuolijoki, also gave him a deeper understanding of performance and its relationship to literature. </p><p>Schildt's work has continued to be celebrated in Finland and abroad, with several posthumous collections and translations being published throughout the decades. In addition to the Runar Schildt Award, Schildt was also awarded the Pro Finlandia Medal in 1951, which is given to individuals who have made significant contributions to Finnish culture. Schildt's legacy as a writer, art collector, theater enthusiast, and social critic continues to be remembered and appreciated by many.</p><p>Schildt's writing was not always well-received during his lifetime, as his modernist style was seen as controversial by some critics. However, his work has since been reassessed and celebrated as a significant contribution to Finnish and Scandinavian literature. In addition to his literary and artistic pursuits, Schildt was also interested in folklore and the cultural traditions of Finland. He collected and published folk tales and legends, helping to preserve a part of Finnish heritage. Schildt's interest in folklore also influenced his writing, as he incorporated elements of mythology and folklore into his work. </p><p>Schildt's impact on the Finnish cultural scene has been significant, and he is still considered one of the most important writers of the modernist movement in Finland. His work continues to inspire new generations of writers and artists, and his legacy as a literary innovator and cultural leader lives on.</p><p></p><p>
