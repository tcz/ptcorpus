						</p><p>May Irwin rose to prominence in the late 19th century for her comedic performances on stage and in early films. She became one of the first women to not only act in movies, but to also co-write and produce her own films. Irwin's most famous role was in the 1896 short film "The Kiss," which features her sharing a passionate onscreen kiss with fellow actor John C. Rice. The film caused controversy at the time due to its explicit nature, but it also helped to pave the way for more realistic portrayals of intimacy in cinema.</p><p>In addition to her work in entertainment, Irwin was also a philanthropist and women's rights activist. She was a supporter of the suffragette movement and spoke out against the mistreatment of female factory workers. Later in life, she became an advocate for animal rights and helped to establish several animal shelters and humane societies.</p><p>Despite her success and popularity during her lifetime, May Irwin's contributions to the entertainment industry were largely forgotten in the decades following her death. However, in recent years she has received renewed attention for her pioneering work as a female filmmaker and performer, and has been recognized as a trailblazer for women in the arts.</p><p></p><p>
