						</p><p>May Irwin rose to prominence in the late 19th century for her comedic performances on stage and in early films. She became one of the first women to not only act in movies, but to also co-write and produce her own films. Irwin's most famous role was in the 1896 short film "The Kiss," which features her sharing a passionate onscreen kiss with fellow actor John C. Rice. The film caused controversy at the time due to its explicit nature, but it also helped to pave the way for more realistic portrayals of intimacy in cinema.</p><p>In addition to her work in entertainment, Irwin was also a philanthropist and women's rights activist. She was a supporter of the suffragette movement and spoke out against the mistreatment of female factory workers. Later in life, she became an advocate for animal rights and helped to establish several animal shelters and humane societies.</p><p>Despite her success and popularity during her lifetime, May Irwin's contributions to the entertainment industry were largely forgotten in the decades following her death. However, in recent years she has received renewed attention for her pioneering work as a female filmmaker and performer, and has been recognized as a trailblazer for women in the arts.</p><p>May Irwin's career spanned over several decades, during which she performed in many popular productions. She starred in the original Broadway productions of hit shows such as "The Widow Jones" and "Sister Mary" and also recorded many popular songs, including the famous tune "After the Ball." Her singing style, which blended elements of jazz, blues, and vaudeville, was highly influential and inspired many performers who followed in her footsteps. May Irwin was also a skilled entrepreneur who managed her own theatrical company and owned a chain of successful vaudeville theaters across North America.</p><p>In her personal life, May Irwin was known for her warm and generous personality. She was married to her husband, Kurt Eisfeldt, for over 55 years until his death in 1926. Irwin and Eisfeldt adopted two children, Harry and Walter, and May remained devoted to them throughout her life. She was known to be an avid reader and an enthusiastic gardener, and spent her later years enjoying her hobbies and spending time with her family.</p><p>May Irwin's legacy as a pioneer for women in the entertainment industry and a champion of social causes continues to inspire generations of artists and activists to this day. Her impact on the history of cinema and popular culture cannot be overstated, and she remains an important figure in Canadian and American history.</p><p>Aside from her success in the entertainment industry, May Irwin was also a successful author. In 1901, she published her first book, "Miss Cherry Blossom of Tokyo," which was a romantic adventure story set in Japan. She went on to write several more books, including a memoir titled "From the White House to the Stage," which chronicled her experiences performing for U.S. Presidents and other notable figures.</p><p>In addition to her philanthropic work, May Irwin was a supporter of the temperance movement and even became a spokesperson for Coca-Cola, which was marketed as a non-alcoholic alternative to beer and other alcoholic beverages. She also worked with the American Red Cross during World War I to raise funds for wounded soldiers and their families.</p><p>May Irwin's impact on popular culture can still be seen today. The iconic kiss from "The Kiss" has been referenced and recreated in countless films and television shows, and her pioneering work as a female filmmaker and performer has inspired generations of women in the arts. In recognition of her contributions to the entertainment industry, May Irwin was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2019.</p><p></p><p>
