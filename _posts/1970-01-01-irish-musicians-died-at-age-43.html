The tour is now considered a landmark moment in the history of rugby union and helped establish the All Blacks as a dominant force in the sport.</p><p>Despite his success, Gallaher remained humble and committed to the principles of fair play and sportsmanship throughout his career. Off the field, he worked as a teacher and was highly respected in the rugby community for his dedication to the sport.</p><p>Tragically, Gallaher's life was cut short when he was killed in action during the Battle of Passchendaele in World War I. He was buried in Belgium, but his memory lives on through the continued legacy of the All Blacks and the sport of rugby union.</p><p>In honor of Gallaher's contributions to New Zealand rugby, the New Zealand Rugby Union named the Gallaher Cup after him.
