							Django Reinhardt is widely recognized as one of the most important and influential musicians of the 20th century, particularly in the development of jazz music. Born into a Romani family in Belgium, Reinhardt overcame a difficult childhood to become a masterful guitarist by his teens. His unique style incorporated elements of jazz, folk, and Romani music, and he was revered for his technical skill and lightning-fast improvisation. Along with the Hot Club of France Quintet, Reinhardt popularized the genre of Gypsy Jazz, which has gone on to inspire countless musicians around the world. Despite losing the use of two fingers in a fire, Reinhardt continued to perform with a modified playing style that only added to his legendary status. He died in 1953 at the age of 43, but his impact on music can still be heard today.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=9039" title="Wikipedia article about Django Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swiss-musicians-died-at-age-54.html' title='Swiss musicians died at age 54'><strong>Swiss musicians died at age 54</strong> List of the top 4 Swiss music stars who died when they were 54</a></li><li><a href='/pakistani-musicians-died-at-age-49.html' title='Pakistani musicians died at age 49'><strong>Pakistani musicians died at age 49</strong> List of the top 5 Pakistani music stars who died when they were 49</a></li><li><a href='/irish-actors-died-in-natural-causes.html' title='Irish actors died in Natural causes'><strong>Irish actors died in Natural causes</strong> List of the top 5 Irish actors who died in Natural causes</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/belgian-actors-died-at-age-38.html' title='Belgian actors died at age 38'><strong>Belgian actors died at age 38</strong> List of the top 1 Belgian actors who died when they were 38</a></li><li><a href='/american-actors-died-at-age-42.html' title='American actors died at age 42'><strong>American actors died at age 42</strong> List of the top 9 American actors who died when they were 42</a></li><li><a href='/english-actors-died-at-age-37.html' title='English actors died at age 37'><strong>English actors died at age 37</strong> List of the top 1 English actors who died when they were 37</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
