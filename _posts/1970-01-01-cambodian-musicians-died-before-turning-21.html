						</p><p>Jayavarman VII was a powerful ruler of the Khmer Empire who reigned from 1181 to approximately 1218 CE. He is known for his military campaigns, religious reforms, and large-scale building projects, including the construction of Angkor Thom and several monumental Buddhist temples. Jayavarman VII's reign was marked by a period of relative stability and prosperity, and he is widely regarded as one of Cambodia's most influential kings. His legacy has had a lasting impact on Cambodian culture and politics, and he remains an important figure in the country's history.</p><p>Additionally, Jayavarman VII was a devout Buddhist and his religious reforms reflect this. He founded the Mahayana Buddhist sect known as the cult of the Avalokiteshvara, which emphasized compassion and the importance of helping others. His reign was marked by the construction of several hospitals and rest houses for pilgrims, and he also instituted policies that provided aid to the poor and disadvantaged. Jayavarman VII's military campaigns were also notable, as he successfully repelled invasions from neighboring kingdoms and expanded the Khmer Empire's territory to include parts of present-day Thailand and Laos. His reign also saw the establishment of a centralized system of governance, which further strengthened the Khmer Empire. Despite his accomplishments, Jayavarman VII's death was followed by a period of decline for the Khmer Empire, which was eventually conquered by the neighboring kingdom of Ayutthaya. Nonetheless, his legacy as a powerful and benevolent ruler has endured and continues to inspire the people of Cambodia.</p><p>Jayavarman VII was born in 1125 to Queen Jayarajadevi and King Dharanindravarman II. He was initially a prince of the Chakravartin dynasty, which ruled over the Khmer Empire from approximately the 9th to the 13th centuries. After his father's death, Jayavarman VII spent several years in exile before returning to claim the throne in 1181.</p><p>During his reign, Jayavarman VII oversaw the construction of several important landmarks, including the Bayon temple and Angkor Thom. He also commissioned the creation of many statues and other artwork, some of which can still be seen in Cambodia today. Jayavarman VII also encouraged the spread of Buddhism throughout the Khmer Empire, and his influence can still be felt in the country's culture and religion.</p><p>Jayavarman VII's reign was not without its challenges, however. In addition to facing external threats from neighboring kingdoms, he also had to contend with internal strife and rebellion. Nevertheless, he managed to maintain a degree of stability and prosperity throughout his reign, and he is remembered as one of Cambodia's most important rulers.</p><p>Today, Jayavarman VII is often cited as a symbol of Cambodian resilience and independence. His legacy continues to inspire future generations of Cambodian leaders and citizens, and his contributions to the country's art, culture, and history are still celebrated and honored today.</p><p>Jayavarman VII's impact on the Khmer Empire extended beyond his political and religious achievements. He is also remembered for his efforts in improving infrastructure, such as building roads, bridges, and water systems, which allowed for easier transportation and communication throughout the empire. Additionally, he is credited with reforming the Khmer military and establishing a more effective system of defense.</p><p>The construction of Angkor Thom, a massive walled city with elaborate gates, was one of Jayavarman VII's most significant building projects. The city served as the new capital of the Khmer Empire and was home to several important religious and administrative buildings, as well as residences for the royal family and elite.</p><p>Jayavarman VII's religious reforms were not only aimed at promoting Buddhism but also at creating a sense of unity among the Khmer people. He encouraged the use of the Khmer language in religious texts and inscriptions, rather than the traditional Sanskrit, which was inaccessible to many people. He also promoted the use of vernacular Khmer in public life, which helped to establish Khmer as the country's official language.</p><p>Despite the decline of the Khmer Empire following his death, Jayavarman VII's legacy continued to influence subsequent rulers of Cambodia. His ideas about governance, Buddhism, and infrastructure development were passed down through generations, and many of his monuments and religious reforms remain central to Cambodian culture and identity to this day.</p><p></p><p>

This site, which served as the capital of the Khmer Empire during his reign, houses several impressive monuments and temples, including the famous Prasat Thom temple pyramid.</p><p>Jayavarman IV was born into a family of Khmer aristocrats and was educated at the royal court of Angkor. He is believed to have been a devout follower of the Hindu god Shiva and his temple at Koh Ker was dedicated to this deity.

He was succeeded by his son Harshavarman I, who ruled for only four years before being assassinated. The subsequent period of instability and political turmoil in the Khmer Empire contributed to the decline and eventual collapse of the civilization.</p><p>Today, the temples at Koh Ker are a popular destination for tourists and history enthusiasts who want to explore the rich cultural heritage of Southeast Asia. The site has undergone extensive restoration and preservation efforts in recent years, ensuring that future generations will be able to appreciate the beauty and grandeur of these ancient structures.</p><p>Jayavarman IV's legacy extends beyond just his architectural and military accomplishments.

As the capital shifted to Koh Ker, there was a shift in economic power towards the north, with new trade routes being established and a greater emphasis placed on agriculture and trade.

His achievements helped to shape the course of Cambodian history and continue to inspire people around the world today.</p><p>Jayavarman IV's temple city at Koh Ker remained an important center of Khmer Empire until the reign of his grandson, Rajendravarman II in the late 10th century. However, after the collapse of the empire, the city was abandoned and remained hidden in the jungle for many centuries. The site was rediscovered by French archaeologists in the early 20th century and efforts were made towards its restoration and preservation. Today, the temples at Koh Ker are one of the most important archaeological sites in Cambodia, attracting visitors from around the world.</p><p>Jayavarman IV's reign also marked the beginning of a new era of Khmer art and architecture, which reached its zenith under later kings such as Jayavarman VII. His construction of the temple city at Koh Ker paved the way for the construction of other magnificent structures such as Angkor Wat and Bayon Temple. His architectural style featuring towering pyramids and elaborate carvings became a hallmark of Khmer architecture, and many of his innovations would be adopted by later Khmer kings.</p><p>Overall, Jayavarman IV's legacy can be seen not only in the magnificent structures he built but also in the lasting impact he had on the culture and society of the Khmer Empire.
