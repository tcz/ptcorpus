(November 6, 1673		Moscow-November 2, 1729			Beryozovo, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug)


was
a Russian
generalissimo.


					
			
		His child
		is
		called
		Alexander Alexandrovich Menshikov.

						</p><p>Alexander Danilovich Menshikov was one of the closest confidants of the Russian tsar, Peter the Great. He played a crucial role in the military campaigns of Peter's Great Northern War, and was instrumental in the modernization of the Russian army. Throughout his career, Menshikov accumulated immense wealth and power and was regarded as one of the wealthiest men in Russia. However, his influence eventually waned and he was accused of corruption and misdeeds. He was exiled by the new tsar, Peter II, and later died in Beryozovo, Siberia. In addition to his military and political pursuits, Menshikov was a patron of the arts and amassed an impressive collection of art and antiques.</p><p>Menshikov was born into a low-class family in Moscow, but his military talents caught the attention of Peter the Great, who made him a close associate and confidant. Menshikov became a leader in the Russian military and played an important role in the capture of the Swedish fortress of Nyenskans during the Great Northern War. He continued to serve in various military campaigns, including the capture of Azov from the Turks. </p><p>Menshikov's influence extended beyond the military, as he became a major player in Russian politics. He rose to become a governor and later a senator, and was granted the title of Prince by Peter the Great. However, his increasing wealth and power made him many enemies, and his corrupt practices ultimately led to his downfall. After his exile, Menshikov continued to correspond with Peter the Great until the tsar's death in 1725.</p><p>Menshikov was known for his lavish lifestyle, and his palace in St. Petersburg was said to be one of the grandest in Russia. He was a patron of the arts, and his collection of paintings, sculptures, and rare objects was considered one of the finest in Europe. In addition to his patronage of the arts, Menshikov was also a major supporter of science and education, and played an important role in the establishment of Russia's first university. Despite his controversial legacy, Menshikov remains a prominent figure in Russian history.</p><p>Menshikov's career and influence had a significant impact on Russia's trajectory as a world power. He is credited with modernizing the Russian military and contributing to its successes in the Great Northern War. However, his questionable business dealings and political maneuvering also highlight issues with corruption and abuse of power within the Russian government. Menshikov's palace in St. Petersburg, known as the Menshikov Palace, still stands today and is open to the public as a museum. The collection of art and antiques that he amassed during his lifetime remains an important part of Russia's cultural heritage. Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, Menshikov's contributions to Russian society in the military, politics, and the arts continue to be studied and remembered.</p><p>Menshikov's personal life was also marked by scandal and controversy. He was known for his love affairs with women of the Russian court, including Peter the Great's daughter Elizabeth. He fathered several children out of wedlock, and one of his sons, Dmitry Menshikov, was involved in a failed plot to overthrow the new tsar, Peter II. Menshikov himself was accused of plotting against Peter II and was exiled to Siberia, where he spent the rest of his life in relative obscurity.</p><p>Despite his fall from grace, Menshikov's legacy as a military commander and political figure continued to be celebrated in Russia. He was the subject of numerous biographies and works of art, including a play by Alexander Pushkin. The Menshikov Palace in St. Petersburg, which was seized by the Bolsheviks after the Russian Revolution, was restored in the 20th century and is now a popular tourist attraction. Today, Menshikov is remembered as one of the most influential figures of Peter the Great's reign and a key player in putting Russia on the path to becoming a major European power.</p><p></p><p>

During his time in Germany, he also became close friends with director Fritz Lang, which led to his involvement in several of Lang's films.</p><p>Rotmil's experience in fleeing Nazi regimes twice also had a profound impact on his work.
