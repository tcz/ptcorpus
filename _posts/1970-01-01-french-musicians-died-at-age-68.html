In 1783, he was appointed as Controller-General of Finances by the King, in an attempt to solve the financial crisis that had plagued France for years. </p><p>While in office, de Calonne introduced a number of reforms aimed at increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. He proposed the creation of a universal land tax that would replace the existing taxes, which were complicated and often evaded. He also suggested the abolition of internal tariffs, which hindered trade and commerce, and the establishment of free trade zones. These proposals were ahead of their time and were resisted by powerful interest groups, including the nobility and clergy.</p><p>De Calonne's reforms were also undermined by his lavish lifestyle and excessive spending.

He returned to France in 1802 but died shortly thereafter in his hometown of Douai. </p><p>Despite his failures, de Calonne was a pioneer of economic reform in France and his ideas influenced subsequent generations of policymakers. He was one of the first to recognize the importance of free trade and the need for a modern tax system, and he challenged the traditional privileges of the nobility and clergy. His legacy was an important step towards the French Revolution and the modernization of the French economy.</p><p></p><p>

was
a French
physician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering work in electrical stimulation of muscles and the use of photography to capture facial expressions, which he employed to identify the specific muscles that create different facial expressions. He is considered a founder of modern neurology and his work on the muscles of facial expression, particularly the so-called "Duchenne smile", has had a lasting impact on our understanding of human emotion. In addition to his scientific work, Duchenne was also an accomplished photographer, and his photographs remain some of the earliest and most detailed records of human facial expression.</p><p>Duchenne de Boulogne became interested in medicine and biology at a young age, and he studied these subjects in school before becoming a trainee at the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris hospital. After earning his medical degree, he began working on a research project focusing on the anatomy and physiology of muscles. He was convinced that the human body was capable of producing infinite expressions through the diverse muscles on the face, and with his groundbreaking scientific efforts, he managed to create a topographic map of facial muscles. Duchenne discovered that different facial expressions are created by specific muscles, and that they can be stimulated through electricity to produce the desired expression.</p><p>In addition, Duchenne was a strong advocate for the use of photography in scientific documentation. He developed the "Duchenne electrodiagnostic apparatus," which could stimulate a person's facial muscles through electrical impulses and simultaneously take photographs of their expressions. He used this apparatus to capture thousands of photographs of individuals making a wide range of facial expressions, which he then analyzed to identify the specific muscles responsible for each expression.</p><p>Duchenne was widely recognized for his contributions to the field of medicine, and many of his discoveries, including the "Duchenne smile," are still widely used today. His work paved the way for future advancements in neurology, muscle physiology, and photography, and he remains a celebrated figure in the scientific community.</p><p></p><p>

Unfortunately, Halbwachs died in Buchenwald concentration camp during World War II, where he was imprisoned for his Jewish heritage.</p><p>Prior to his death, Halbwachs was a prominent social theorist, and he played an active role in the intellectual life of Paris in the interwar years.
