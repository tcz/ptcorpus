						</p><p>She was born in Paris and studied at the Paris Conservatory, where she won multiple prizes in music composition. Delbos was also a student of composer and conductor, Charles Koechlin, who greatly influenced her work.</p><p>Delbos was known for her style of composition, which incorporated the traditional classical style with her own unique modernist techniques. She often wrote for chamber ensembles and wrote several orchestral works as well.</p><p>In 1932, she married the famous French composer Olivier Messiaen, who was also one of her former classmates at the Conservatory. They had two children together and often collaborated on musical projects.</p><p>Delbos' musical career was cut short due to her deteriorating mental health, which was exacerbated by the stress of her husband's internment in a prisoner of war camp during World War II. She eventually became institutionalized and spent the rest of her life in a mental hospital. Despite her struggles, she left behind a notable body of work that continues to be studied and performed today.</p><p>One of Delbos' most significant works is her Trio for Flute, Violin, and Viola, which was first performed in 1938. The piece showcases Delbos' unique style, which blends neoclassical and modernist techniques. Another notable composition is her String Quartet, which she wrote in 1941 while her husband was in a prisoner of war camp. The piece is a haunting reflection on her personal struggles and the upheaval of the time.</p><p>Delbos' legacy was largely overshadowed by that of her husband, but the growing interest in women composers has brought renewed attention to her work. In recent years, there has been a renewed focus on Delbos' life and music, with performances and recordings of her works increasing in popularity. Her music is celebrated for its depth of expression and striking emotional intensity, and it continues to inspire new generations of composers and musicians.</p><p></p><p>
