						</p><p>Kerr began her career as a ballet dancer in the 1930s, performing with the Sadler's Wells ballet company. She transitioned to acting in the 1940s, first appearing in small roles in British films. She later gained international fame for her starring roles in Hollywood classics such as "From Here to Eternity," "An Affair to Remember," and "The King and I."</p><p>Kerr received six Academy Award nominations for Best Actress throughout her career, but never won. She also won several other awards over the course of her long and illustrious acting career, including a Golden Globe and a Cannes Film Festival award.</p><p>Kerr was married twice, first to naval officer Anthony Bartley, with whom she had her two daughters, and later to writer Peter Viertel. She was also a breast cancer survivor and became an advocate for breast cancer research and treatment. In 1998, Kerr was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for her services to drama.</p><p>Kerr was born in Scotland but spent much of her childhood living in China due to her father's job as a civil engineer. Her experiences there deeply influenced her and her later performances. She trained as a ballet dancer at the age of 16 and eventually became a member of the Sadler's Wells ballet company. However, a knee injury ended her ballet career and she turned to acting at the suggestion of her mother.</p><p>Kerr's early film roles were mainly in British productions, including the film adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's "Major Barbara." Her breakthrough role came in 1947 in "Black Narcissus," for which she received critical acclaim. She soon caught the attention of Hollywood studios and was signed on by MGM, where she starred in a number of successful films.</p><p>Despite her many nominations, Kerr never won an Academy Award. However, she is remembered as one of the great actresses of her generation and an icon of Hollywood's Golden Age. After retiring from acting in the 1980s, Kerr remained active in philanthropy and charity work. She died in 2007 at the age of 86.</p><p></p><p>

(November 16, 1896		Mayfair, London-December 3, 1980			Orsay)

	
		a.k.a. Sir Oswald Mosley, Mosley, Oswald, Oswald Ernald Mosley, Tom or Sir Oswald Ernald Mosley, 6th Baronet

	
was
a British
politician.


					
			
		He had
		five
		children,
		Max Mosley, Nicholas Mosley, Vivien Mosley, Michael Mosley and Oswald Alexander Mosley.

						</p><p>Mosley was a prominent figure in the British political scene between the World Wars, serving as a Member of Parliament for various parties including the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, and the British Union of Fascists (BUF), which he founded in 1932. He was known for his controversial views on fascism, anti-Semitism, and anti-immigration. Mosley's BUF, modeled after Mussolini's National Fascist Party, attracted a following of around 50,000 members at its peak in the mid-1930s. However, his fascist sympathies and support for the Nazi regime in Germany ultimately led to his arrest and imprisonment during World War II. Following his release in 1943, Mosley remained active in far-right politics and founded several more political parties, though he never regained his earlier widespread support. Mosley's legacy continues to be a source of controversy and debate.</p><p>Mosley was born into a wealthy family and attended prestigious schools, including Winchester College and Sandhurst Military Academy. He served in the military during World War I and was injured in combat. After his military service, Mosley was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in 1918, but he later switched to the Labour Party in 1924 due to disagreements with the Conservative leadership.</p><p>In the 1930s, Mosley became increasingly disillusioned with mainstream politics and formed the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in 1932. He openly praised Mussolini and Hitler and called for a "New Britain" based on fascist principles. The BUF attracted support from disaffected former Labour voters, but it also faced opposition from both mainstream political parties and anti-fascist groups.</p><p>Mosley's fascist sympathies and opposition to the war effort led to his arrest and imprisonment during World War II. After the war, he was largely marginalized in British politics, though he remained active in far-right circles until his death in 1980.</p><p>Despite his controversial views and actions, Mosley is remembered as a skilled orator and a charismatic leader who was able to draw significant support from disaffected voters.</p><p></p><p>
