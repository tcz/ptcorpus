					</p><p>He is most remembered for his role as the founding leader of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, which later became the Bharatiya Janata Party. Upadhyaya's political ideology was centered around the concept of Integral Humanism, which sought to promote a balance between individualism and collectivism, and emphasized the importance of spiritual and cultural values in society.</p><p>As a journalist, Upadhyaya wrote extensively on various social and political issues, including Hindu-Muslim relations, education, and economic policies. He also served as the editor of the Rashtradharma, a Hindi language weekly publication.</p><p>In addition to his political and journalistic pursuits, Upadhyaya was a scholar of ancient Indian history and philosophy. He received a Master's degree in Ancient Indian History from the University of Lucknow, and later taught at St. John's College in Agra.</p><p>Upadhyaya's life and work continue to inspire many in India, particularly those who subscribe to his philosophy of Integral Humanism. The Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute for Research and Education, established in 1977, is dedicated to promoting his ideals and teachings.</p><p>Upadhyaya was born in a small village called Nagla Chandraban in what is now the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh. His father was a school teacher and his mother was a housewife. He was the eldest of four siblings and was raised in a household that placed great emphasis on education.</p><p>Upadhyaya's interest in politics was sparked at a young age when he witnessed first-hand the suffering of people in his village due to poverty and illiteracy. He became involved in the freedom struggle at a young age and was mentored by leaders like Syama Prasad Mookerjee and Ram Manohar Lohia.</p><p>In 1951, Upadhyaya became the General Secretary of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh and was instrumental in shaping the party's ideology and policies.

He emphasized the need for a decentralized political system, where power was distributed among local communities and individuals, rather than concentrated in the hands of a few elites. </p><p>Upadhyaya was known for his simple and austere lifestyle, and his commitment to the principles of honesty and integrity. He lived in a small hut in Delhi and often traveled by third-class train compartments to connect with grassroots supporters. </p><p>Today, his teachings and ideas inform the policies and objectives of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which remains one of India's major political parties. The party celebrates his birthday as "Samarpan Divas" or "Day of Dedication" every year. </p><p>Along with the Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute for Research and Education, several institutions have been named after him, including the Deendayal Port Trust in Gujarat and the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana, a rural electrification scheme launched by the Indian government.</p><p></p><p>
