(April 5, 1275-March 1, 1333)


was
an English
philosopher.


					</p><p>He was born in Alnwick, a small town in Northumberland, England. William studied at the University of Oxford, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in 1296 and a Master's degree in 1301. He became a Franciscan friar and joined the Order of Friars Minor.</p><p>William of Alnwick served as the Minister Provincial of the English province of the Franciscan Order from 1317 to 1320. He spent most of his career teaching philosophy and theology at Oxford, and was known as a master of natural philosophy. He composed several works on Aristotle's physics, metaphysics, and ethics, as well as commentaries on the Sentences of Peter Lombard.</p><p>William was an influential figure in the development of scholastic philosophy in the 14th century. His works were widely read and cited by other scholars, and he was seen as one of the leading thinkers of his time. He was also a prominent member of the community of Franciscan scholars, which was known for its intellectual rigor and commitment to poverty.</p><p>William of Alnwick died in Oxford in 1333, and his tomb is located in the chapel of the Franciscan Friary in that city. His legacy lives on through his writings, which continue to be studied and debated by philosophers to this day.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to philosophy, William of Alnwick was also involved in religious and political affairs. He was a prominent figure in the controversy over the poverty of Christ and the Franciscan Order's commitment to it.

William was a defender of the latter position and wrote a treatise on the subject titled De paupertate Christi et apostolorum. </p><p>William was also involved in negotiations between the English royal court and the papacy. He served as a diplomatic envoy on several occasions, including to the Council of Vienne in 1311, where he represented the English king, Edward II, in discussions about the suppression of the Knights Templar. </p><p>Despite his prominence in his lifetime, William's works fell out of favor in the centuries after his death.
