(January 29, 1915		Illinois-June 8, 1952			Milwaukee)


was
an American
race car driver.


					</p><p>McDowell began his racing career in the mid-1930s, competing in local dirt track races throughout the Midwest. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled driver and began racing on larger, national circuits in the late 1930s. McDowell's most successful period as a driver came during and immediately after World War II, when he won several major races and became one of the top drivers in the country. </p><p>Despite his success, McDowell's career was cut short when he was killed in a racing accident in Milwaukee in 1952. His legacy in the sport has continued, however, with his name enshrined in the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame and a street in his hometown of Joliet, Illinois named in his honor.</p><p>McDowell's passion for racing was evident from an early age, as he often spent his free time working on his own cars and studying automotive engineering. Prior to becoming a race car driver, he worked as a mechanic and attended school to learn more about the technical aspects of automobiles. McDowell's dedication to his craft paid off, as he became known for his ability to tune and modify engines to gain a competitive edge on the track.</p><p>During World War II, McDowell put his racing career on hold to join the military. He served as a mechanic in the Army Air Corps, but was able to continue racing in his spare time. After the war ended, McDowell returned to racing full-time and quickly found success, winning several major races and competing against some of the top drivers of the era.</p><p>McDowell was known for his aggressive driving style, which sometimes led to crashes and other accidents. Despite this, he remained beloved by fans and respected by fellow drivers for his skill behind the wheel. His untimely death in the 1952 Milwaukee accident was a shock to the racing world, and led to renewed focus on safety measures in the sport. Today, McDowell is remembered as a pioneering driver who helped shape the sport of auto racing in America.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1789-November 24, 1826			Kanpur)


was
a British
surgeon.


					</p><p>He was born in Framlingham, Suffolk, England and studied medicine at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London. In 1816, he was appointed surgeon and naturalist to the embassy of Lord Amherst, which was sent to China to establish diplomatic relations. During his time in China, Abel collected specimens of plants, birds, and animals, and wrote a detailed account of his travels and observations in Narrative of a Journey in the Interior of China. </p><p>After returning to England, Abel was appointed assistant-surgeon to the East India Company and sent to India in 1819. There, he continued to collect botanical specimens and conducted research on the medicinal properties of Indian plants. He also served as surgeon to the British garrison in Kanpur during the First Anglo-Burmese War. </p><p>Abel died of fever in Kanpur in 1826 at the age of 37, cutting short a promising career in both medicine and natural history. He is remembered for his contributions to the study of Chinese and Indian flora and fauna, and his observations on the customs and culture of the Chinese people.</p><p>Abel's legacy also includes the discovery of a new species of bamboo, which was named after him: Ampelocalamus clarkei. He is also credited with introducing several Chinese plants to the Western world, including the Osmanthus fragrans, a flowering plant prized for its fragrant flowers. Abel's specimen collections formed the basis of several publications, including John Lindley's digitalization of his account of Chinese travels, which was published in 1818. Abel was also an early advocate of the importance of native systems of medicine, and his writings on the Indian Ayurvedic system influenced Western medical knowledge of traditional Indian medicine. In recognition of his contributions to botany and medicine, the genus Abelmoschus is named after him.</p><p></p><p>
