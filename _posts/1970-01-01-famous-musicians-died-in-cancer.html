She used her connections to help rescue Jewish children and other refugees from the horrors of the Holocaust. Unfortunately, her activities were discovered by the Romanian authorities, and she was arrested, imprisoned, and tortured. After her release, Cebotari fled to Italy, where she continued to perform and collaborate with anti-fascist groups.</p><p>In 1947, Cebotari was diagnosed with leukemia while performing in Rome. She died two years later in Vienna at the age of 39. Despite her short career, Cebotari's legacy in the world of music is profound, and she is still considered one of the most talented singers of her time.
