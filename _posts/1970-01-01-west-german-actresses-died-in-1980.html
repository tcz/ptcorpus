							Olga Chekhova was born as Olga Konstantinovna Chekhova in Gyumri, Armenia (then part of the Russian Empire). She was the niece of Anton Chekhov, the famous Russian playwright and author. Chekhova started her career as an actor on stage in Moscow and then moved to Germany where she began starring in films. She appeared in over 80 films throughout her career, including the notable films "Menschen am Sonntag" (People on Sunday) and "La Habanera". </p><p>During World War II, Chekhova was recruited by Joseph Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda for Nazi Germany, to work in the German film industry. Chekhova's connection to Goebbels started when she was asked to perform for German soldiers in Norway, and she then became a frequent guest at Nazi social events. After the war, Chekhova was blacklisted in Germany for her association with the Nazi regime, but she continued to work on films in other countries such as France and Italy.</p><p>In addition to her career as an actor, Chekhova also produced films and was a successful businesswoman. She was married twice, first to the Russian nobleman Mikhail Chekhov and then to the German film producer Theodor Loos.
