(April 5, 2015		China-August 3, 1992			Beijing)


was
a Chinese
personality.


					</p><p>Wang Hongwen was a prominent leader of the Chinese Communist Party during the Cultural Revolution. Born into a poor peasant family in Anhui Province, Wang moved to Shanghai in 1962 to work in a textile mill. He quickly became involved in Communist Party activities and rose through the ranks to become a member of the Politburo Standing Committee in 1973. Along with the rest of the "Gang of Four," Wang was a strong advocate of Mao Zedong's radical policies and played a key role in promoting the cult of personality surrounding the Chairman. However, after Mao's death in 1976, Wang fell out of favor and was arrested and imprisoned for his role in the Cultural Revolution. He spent the rest of his life in jail and died in 1992.</p><p>During the Cultural Revolution, Wang Hongwen was one of the top leaders of the Red Guards and was known for his extreme radicalism. He was a vocal supporter of Mao's policies and actively worked to suppress any opposition or dissent within the Communist Party. However, after Mao's death and the subsequent downfall of the Gang of Four, Wang was arrested along with the other members and put on trial for their crimes. He was eventually sentenced to life in prison, where he remained until his death.</p><p>While Wang Hongwen was initially seen as a rising star within the Communist Party, his radicalism and loyalty to Mao ultimately led to his downfall. However, his legacy as a key figure in the Cultural Revolution and the wider history of Chinese communism remains an important part of China's past.</p><p>During his time in jail, Wang Hongwen reportedly became very ill and was denied medical treatment. His family has claimed that his death was the result of mistreatment by prison officials. Despite his controversial role in the Cultural Revolution, some supporters have praised Wang for his dedication to Mao and his revolutionary ideals. However, he remains a polarizing figure in China, with many viewing him as a symbol of the excesses and abuses of the Communist Party during the Mao era. His legacy continues to be a topic of debate and discussion in China today.</p><p></p><p>
