(April 4, 1939		Belzoni-December 16, 2014)

	
		also known as Ernest Terrell or The Clutch

	
was
an American
record producer, musician and professional boxer.


						</p><p>Terrell began boxing in 1957 and quickly became a top contender in the heavyweight division. He won the vacant WBA heavyweight title in 1965 by defeating Eddie Machen, but lost it the following year to Muhammad Ali in a highly publicized bout that was marked by Ali's taunting of Terrell. </p><p>After retiring from boxing in 1973, Terrell turned to music and worked as a record producer for many years. He also released several albums of his own as a singer and musician, showcasing his soulful voice and skill on the piano.</p><p>Throughout his life, Terrell was heavily involved in various charitable causes, particularly those aimed at helping underprivileged youth. After his death in 2014, he was remembered as both a talented athlete and musician, as well as a dedicated humanitarian.</p><p>During his boxing career, Ernie Terrell compiled an impressive record of 46 wins (21 by knockouts) and 9 losses. He was known for his towering height (at 6'6") and long reach, which he used to wear down his opponents. However, his most memorable fight was against Muhammad Ali in 1967, which was dubbed the "The Fight of the Century". Ali, who had been stripped of his titles for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War, was looking to reclaim his crown by defeating Terrell. The fight was marked by Ali's anger towards Terrell, who had refused to call him by his Muslim name and instead called him by his birth name, Cassius Clay. Ali punished Terrell throughout the fight, taunting him by repeatedly asking, "What's my name?" He ultimately won by unanimous decision, but critics praised Terrell for his toughness and resilience. </p><p>Aside from his boxing and music careers, Terrell also devoted much of his time to various charitable organizations. He founded the Ernie Terrell Boxing Club in Chicago, which provided free boxing lessons and mentorship to at-risk youth. He also worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and other organizations that aimed to improve the lives of disadvantaged children. Over the years, he received numerous awards and commendations for his philanthropic work, including being named the Humanitarian of the Year by the WBC in 1997.</p><p></p><p>

		otherwise known as William Dees

	
was
an American
songwriter and singer.


						</p><p>Dees was best known for being the co-writer of the hit song "Oh, Pretty Woman" with Roy Orbison. The two had met in 1962 and formed a songwriting partnership that led to several successful songs, including "It's Over" and "Borne on the Wind". Dees also wrote songs for other notable artists such as Johnny Cash and Glen Campbell. In addition to songwriting, he also had a solo career as a singer and released a few albums in the 1970s. Despite his success, Dees struggled with addiction and health issues throughout his life, eventually passing away from an unspecified illness in 2012 at the age of 73.</p><p>Born in Texas in 1939, Dees grew up in poverty and dropped out of high school at the age of 16. He worked odd jobs while pursuing his passion for music and eventually moved to Nashville to pursue a career as a songwriter. It was there that he met Orbison and their songwriting partnership began. "Oh, Pretty Woman" was their biggest hit, reaching number one on the charts in 1964 and later becoming famous again when it was featured in the hit movie Pretty Woman starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. </p><p>Despite his personal struggles, Dees is remembered as a talented songwriter who made a lasting impact on the music industry. His work with Orbison alone cemented his place in music history but his contributions to the careers of other notable artists cannot be overlooked. In 2013, he was posthumously inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.</p><p></p><p>
