(July 28, 1907		Berlin-October 5, 1983			Costa Rica)

	
		also known as Earl Silas Tupper

	
was
a Costa Rican
inventor.


					</p><p>He is best known for creating Tupperware, a brand of airtight plastic containers used for storing food. Tupper's design for Tupperware was inspired by a paint can that he observed being sealed at a factory. He later developed airtight lids and containers made from flexible, durable plastic that could keep food fresh for longer. Tupper's Tupperware became a household name in the 1950s and 60s, thanks to his innovative marketing techniques and successful sales parties. Tupper continued to work on other inventions until his death in 1983.</p><p>Tupper was born in Berlin, New Hampshire in the United States, but spent most of his childhood and early adulthood in rural poverty. He worked as a farmer and tree surgeon before starting his own business selling landscaping tools. Tupper's love for experimentation and passion for engineering led him to create numerous patented inventions, including a fish-powered boat and a method of mass-producing plastic signs. However, it was his creation of Tupperware that would make him a household name and earn him a prominent place in American cultural history. Despite facing financial setbacks and legal disputes over his invention, Tupper remained dedicated to his vision of creating durable and functional household products. Tupperware continues to be sold around the world today, and has become a symbol of mid-century American suburban life. Tupper's legacy as an inventor and entrepreneur continues to inspire new generations of innovators.</p><p></p><p>
