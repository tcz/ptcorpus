In his honor, the Municipal Theatre of Kecskemét (his hometown) was renamed the Latabár Kálmán Theatre.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=28540709" title="Wikipedia article about Kálmán Latabár">Kálmán Latabár on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/italian-actresses-died-at-age-31.html' title='Italian actresses died at age 31'><strong>Italian actresses died at age 31</strong> List of the top 1 Italian actresses who died when they were 31</a></li><li><a href='/american-musicians-died-in-inhalation-of-vomit.html' title='American musicians died in Inhalation of vomit'><strong>American musicians died in Inhalation of vomit</strong> List of the top 2 American music stars who died in Inhalation of vomit</a></li><li><a href='/irish-actresses-died-in-1981.html' title='Irish actresses died in 1981'><strong>Irish actresses died in 1981</strong> List of the top 3 Irish actresses who died in 1981</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-virus.html' title='Famous actors died in Virus'><strong>Famous actors died in Virus</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actors who died in Virus</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-at-age-51.html' title='Famous actors died at age 51'><strong>Famous actors died at age 51</strong> List of the top 9 Famous actors who died when they were 51</a></li><li><a href='/dutch-musicians-died-in-pneumonia.html' title='Dutch musicians died in Pneumonia'><strong>Dutch musicians died in Pneumonia</strong> List of the top 1 Dutch music stars who died in Pneumonia</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
