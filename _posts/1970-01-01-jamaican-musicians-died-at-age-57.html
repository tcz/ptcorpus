						Joseph Hill is famously known as the lead singer for the Jamaican reggae group Culture, which formed in 1976. Hill's deep, powerful vocals and socially conscious lyrics were hallmarks of the band's sound. He wrote most of the group's songs, which often addressed issues such as poverty, inequality, and injustice, and his music became anthems for the oppressed and downtrodden. Over the course of his career, Hill released more than 30 albums with Culture and as a solo artist. In addition to his music, Hill was also a devout Rastafarian and his beliefs often influenced his lyrics. Sadly, Hill passed away in 2006 while on tour in Europe. He was posthumously awarded the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican government in recognition of his contributions to music.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=254657" title="Wikipedia article about Joseph Hill">Joseph Hill on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/hungarian-actors-died-at-age-65.html' title='Hungarian actors died at age 65'><strong>Hungarian actors died at age 65</strong> List of the top 2 Hungarian actors who died when they were 65</a></li><li><a href='/norwegian-actresses-died-at-age-58.html' title='Norwegian actresses died at age 58'><strong>Norwegian actresses died at age 58</strong> List of the top 1 Norwegian actresses who died when they were 58</a></li><li><a href='/russian-actors-died-in-2010.html' title='Russian actors died in 2010'><strong>Russian actors died in 2010</strong> List of the top 3 Russian actors who died in 2010</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-actresses-died-at-age-36.html' title='Famous actresses died at age 36'><strong>Famous actresses died at age 36</strong> List of the top 7 Famous actresses who died when they were 36</a></li><li><a href='/kuwaiti-musicians-died-at-age-79.html' title='Kuwaiti musicians died at age 79'><strong>Kuwaiti musicians died at age 79</strong> List of the top 1 Kuwaiti music stars who died when they were 79</a></li><li><a href='/german-musicians-died-in-liver-tumour.html' title='German musicians died in Liver tumour'><strong>German musicians died in Liver tumour</strong> List of the top 1 German music stars who died in Liver tumour</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
