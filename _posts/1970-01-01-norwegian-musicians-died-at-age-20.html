Ulven is well-known for his experimental and introspective style of writing, and his works often explore themes such as loneliness, alienation, and the human condition. His most famous works include the poetry collections "Det tredje tegnet" and "Gravgaver", and the novel "Kongen er død". Despite his relatively short career, Ulven is considered to be one of the most important Norwegian writers of the late 20th century.</p><p>In addition to his career in poetry and literature, Tor Ulven was also a translator and editor.

In the years following his death, his work has continued to be celebrated and studied in Norway and internationally, and he remains a prominent figure in Norwegian literature.</p><p>Ulven was the recipient of several awards for his contributions to literature, including the Gyldendal's Endowment award in 1988 and the Dobloug Prize in 1990. His poetry has been praised for its use of language and its ability to convey deep emotions with few words. Many literary critics have compared his work to that of other great Nordic writers like Knut Hamsun and Tomas Tranströmer. Ulven's writing was also heavily influenced by contemporary American literature, particularly the works of Beat writers like Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac. Despite his relatively short career, Ulven's impact on Norwegian literature is lasting, and his works continue to be read and studied today.</p><p>Ulven's poetry and writing were also known for their use of symbolism and imagery. His works often employ unconventional metaphors and descriptors to explore complex emotional and psychological states. In addition to his writing, Ulven was also a talented visual artist and photographer. He often incorporated his artwork into his poetry collections and publications. Ulven's legacy has continued to grow in the years since his death, with new translations and analyses of his work being produced regularly.
