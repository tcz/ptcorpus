(December 7, 1545		Temple Newsam-February 10, 1567			Kirk o&#039; Field)


was
an English
personality.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		James VI and I.

						</p><p>Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley was a significant figure in Scottish and English history. He was the second husband of the infamous Mary, Queen of Scots, whom he married in 1565. As the son of Matthew Stuart, 4th Earl of Lennox, his marriage to Mary, Queen of Scots was seen as a strategic move to strengthen his family's claim to the Scottish throne. </p><p>However, Darnley's marriage to Mary was a turbulent one. He was known for his vanity, arrogance, and violent temper. He often clashed with Mary's advisers, particularly her trusted friend and advisor, David Rizzio. It was rumored that he had a hand in Rizzio's murder, which led to a breakdown in his marriage and increased tensions between Mary and her subjects.</p><p>Darnley's own life was cut short in a brutal manner when he was assassinated in his lodgings at Kirk o' Field in 1567. Although it remains unclear who was responsible for his murder, it is widely believed that Mary's second husband, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, played a role. Darnley's death effectively marked the end of Mary's reign and forever cemented his place in history as a tragic figure.</p><p>Darnley's assassination was a turning point in the history of Scotland, leading to a series of events that ultimately led to Mary's own downfall. Despite his tumultuous life, Darnley is remembered for his role in producing an heir to the Scottish throne, James VI and I, who would go on to rule England and Scotland. James' mother, Mary, was forced to abdicate the Scottish throne shortly after Darnley's murder, and he was declared King of Scotland in 1567. James' rule would bring about significant changes in English and Scottish politics, including the union of the two kingdoms under a single monarch. While Darnley's life was short and turbulent, his legacy would continue to shape the course of British history for centuries to come.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in assassination.
