		a.k.a. Ioan-Isidor Goldstein, Jean-Isidore Golstein or Jean Isidore Isou

	
was
a French
poet, film critic, visual artist, film director, actor and screenwriter.


						</p><p>
							Isou was a leading figure in the Lettrist movement, which emphasised spontaneity and improvisation in art, and sought to subvert traditional conventions of language, literature and film. In his poetry and prose, Isou developed a theory of "discrepancy" which celebrated the gaps and inconsistencies between words and meanings, and sought to create an entirely new language which would be capable of expressing the complexity and chaos of modern life. As a filmmaker, Isou was known for his radical approach to editing and sound, and his films often featured fragmented images and abstract soundscapes which aimed to challenge the viewer's perception and understanding of cinema. Despite his controversial approach and marginal status within the mainstream art world, Isou's work has continued to influence generations of experimental artists and thinkers.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=2142453" title="Wikipedia article about Isidore Isou">Isidore Isou on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Christian Marquand</h2><p><strong>Christian Marquand</strong>
