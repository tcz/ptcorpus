						</p><p>Juan Gris was a key member of the Cubist movement along with Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. He was known for his use of geometric shapes and subdued colors in his paintings, which explored themes of still life and interior scenes. Prior to his involvement in the Cubist movement, Gris worked as an illustrator and caricaturist for various publications. He also experimented with different styles, including Fauvism, before developing his signature Cubist style. Gris' work is characterized by its precision and attention to detail, as well as its sense of harmony and balance. Today, his paintings are considered to be some of the most important works of the Cubist movement.</p><p>Juan Gris was born as the thirteenth child of a wealthy man named Gregorio González, who was a Castilian paper manufacturer, and his wife Isabel Pérez. Gris was sent to study engineering in Madrid in 1902, but he quit after two years to pursue art. He moved to Paris in 1906, where he met Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, the founders of Cubism. He quickly adopted the style and became one of its leading exponents.</p><p>In 1912, Gris exhibited his works for the first time at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris. His works were well received, and he soon gained recognition for his unique approach to Cubism. Over the years, Gris developed his own distinct style, in which he used a wide range of materials, including newspapers, advertisements, and musical scores, to create collages that sought to capture the sensation of modern life.</p><p>Gris also designed costumes and sets for several ballets and operas, including Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. In addition to his visual art, Gris also wrote poetry and essays on art.</p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Juan Gris had a profound impact on the development of modern art, and his works remain highly sought after by collectors and art enthusiasts around the world.</p><p>In the last years of his life, Juan Gris' health began to decline, and he suffered from intense migraines and chronic renal issues. Despite his health struggles, he continued to produce artwork until his death in 1927 at the age of 40. Before his passing, Gris had gained international recognition for his innovative approach to Cubism and his significant contributions to the art world. Today, his works are showcased in renowned museums around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris. Juan Gris' enduring legacy continues to inspire and influence generations of artists who continue to build upon his groundbreaking ideas and techniques.</p><p>One interesting fact about Juan Gris is that he was very close friends with the writer and art collector Gertrude Stein. Stein became one of Gris' most significant patrons and collectors, urging her own friends to buy his works and providing him with critical support throughout his career. In fact, Gris' 1915 portrait of Gertrude Stein is one of his most iconic works, and is now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Gris himself also became a collector of sorts, amassing a personal collection of art and artifacts that included works by his fellow Cubists, as well as African masks and other non-Western objects.</p><p></p><p>
