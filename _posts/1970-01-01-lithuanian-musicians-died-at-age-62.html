					</p><p>He began his career as an actor in the Russian Empire and later became a director in the Soviet Union. Doller was part of the avant-garde movement in the Soviet film industry in the 1920s and 1930s. He is best known for his films "The Five-Year Plan" (1927) and "Turksib" (1930), which were pioneering works of socialist realism.

In addition to his film work, Doller was also an accomplished theatre director and taught at the Moscow Institute of Cinematography. He died in Moscow in 1952.</p><p>Doller was born into a Jewish family in Vilnius, which was then part of the Russian Empire (present-day Lithuania). He began his acting career in the early 1910s and appeared in several silent films. In 1925, Doller directed his first film, "The Knight of the Two Swords," which was also his first foray into the avant-garde film movement. He continued to experiment with innovative cinematic techniques throughout his career, and his films were known for their visual style and use of montage.</p><p>In the early 1930s, Doller shifted from experimental filmmaking to socialist realism, a style that was promoted by the Soviet authorities. His films "Turksib" and "The Five-Year Plan" were both examples of this style and were praised for their celebration of Soviet achievements. During World War II, Doller directed several propaganda films, including "Frontline Symphony" (1942) and "To the Sons of the Soviet Union" (1943).</p><p>Despite being a respected filmmaker in the Soviet Union, Doller faced criticism and censorship during his career. His film "The Secret Agent" (1936) was banned for its depiction of police brutality, and he was accused of being a formalist by Soviet authorities. Nevertheless, Doller continued to work in the film industry until his death in 1952.</p><p>Today, Doller is remembered as a pioneering Soviet filmmaker who experimented with avant-garde techniques and later embraced socialist realism. His contributions to Soviet cinema earned him several awards and recognition, including the Stalin Prize and the Order of Lenin.</p><p>Doller was also a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and used his films as a means of promoting communist ideals. He believed in the power of cinema as a tool for political education and worked to create films that would inspire and motivate Soviet citizens. In addition to his work in film and theatre, Doller was also a writer and published several articles and essays on cinema. He was a respected teacher and mentor to many young filmmakers, including Andrei Tarkovsky, who later became a prominent figure in Soviet cinema. Doller's legacy continues to influence contemporary filmmakers in Russia and around the world. Several of his films have been restored and re-released in recent years, allowing new audiences to appreciate his innovative approach to filmmaking.</p><p>Doller's interest in cinema began from a young age, and he was inspired by the work of French filmmaker Georges Méliès. He studied at the St. Petersburg State Theatre School and later at the Moscow Art Theatre, where he developed his skills as an actor and director. He was also influenced by the works of Russian avant-garde artists and was involved in the art scene in Moscow in the 1910s and 1920s.</p><p>In addition to his film work, Doller was active in the Soviet film industry and served as the head of the Leningrad Studio of Documentary Films. He was also a member of the Soviet film organization, Sovkino, which was responsible for the distribution of films in the Soviet Union.</p><p>Doller's films were known for their social and political themes, and he often used his works as a means of promoting communist ideals. His film "Turksib" celebrated the construction of a railway line between Turkestan and Siberia, which was seen as a symbol of Soviet progress and industrialization. Doller's films were popular with Soviet audiences and were shown not only in cinemas but also in factories, schools, and remote villages.</p><p>Despite his contributions to Soviet cinema, Doller's legacy was largely overshadowed by the works of other filmmakers during the Soviet era. It was only after the collapse of the Soviet Union that his films began to receive the recognition they deserved. Today, Doller is recognized as one of the pioneers of Soviet cinema and his innovative approach to filmmaking continues to inspire new generations of filmmakers.</p><p></p><p>

(December 7, 1830		Vilnius-December 16, 1892			Saint Petersburg)

	
		also known as Leon Gordon

	
was
a Lithuanian
writer.


					</p><p>Considered one of the pioneers of modern Hebrew literature, Judah Leib Gordon was a prolific writer who produced poetry, fiction, and essays. He was born in Vilnius, Lithuania (then part of the Russian Empire) and received a traditional Jewish education. However, he was also exposed to secular literature and began to write in Hebrew, which was not a common language for creative writing at the time. He became part of the Haskalah movement, which aimed to modernize Jewish culture and lift Jews out of poverty and ignorance. </p><p>Gordon's poetry often dealt with themes of nature, love, and the beauty of the Hebrew language. His fiction included short stories, novellas, and a novel, all of which explored the lives of ordinary people in Jewish communities. He also wrote critical essays, some of which were controversial for their attacks on traditional Jewish beliefs and practices. </p><p>In addition to his literary work, Gordon was a teacher and a translator. He taught Hebrew and Russian in various schools and institutions, and translated works from Russian and German into Hebrew. He was well-respected in the Jewish community, and his work influenced many younger Hebrew writers in the decades to come.</p><p>Gordon's impact on Hebrew literature was not limited to his own works. He played a significant role in promoting modern Hebrew writing and helped establish the Hebrew language as a vehicle for creative expression. His emphasis on using Hebrew to express everyday life experiences helped break down the idea that Hebrew was a purely academic or religious language. He also helped pave the way for future writers by establishing Hebrew as a language that could be used to tackle contemporary issues.</p><p>Despite facing many challenges and criticisms throughout his career, Gordon persisted in his work and continued to push the boundaries of Hebrew literature. He was known for his dedication to education and his commitment to improving the lives of Jews through cultural and literary initiatives. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures in the development of modern Hebrew literature and is celebrated for his contributions to Jewish culture and scholarship.</p><p>Gordon was also involved in politics and was a supporter of the Hovevei Zion movement, which sought to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He wrote articles and gave speeches promoting Jewish settlement in Palestine and was one of the first Jewish intellectuals to openly support Zionism. He believed that a Jewish state was necessary to protect Jews from persecution and to revive Jewish culture.</p><p>In his later years, Gordon struggled with financial difficulties and health problems. He moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where he continued to write and teach until his death in 1892 at the age of 62. Today, he is remembered as a cultural icon and a pioneer of modern Hebrew literature. Many of his works have been translated into various languages and continue to be studied and enjoyed by readers around the world.</p><p>In addition to his literary and political contributions, Judah Leib Gordon was also known for his deep humanitarianism. He was an advocate for the poor and oppressed, and his writing often reflected his concern for social justice. He was especially vocal on issues such as the mistreatment of Jewish workers in the garment industry and the plight of Jewish refugees. Gordon's belief in equality and his commitment to social reform made him a beloved figure in the Jewish community and beyond.</p><p>Despite facing many obstacles throughout his life, Gordon's legacy lives on. His work helped elevate the status of Hebrew literature and paved the way for future generations of writers to explore a range of subjects and themes. Today, his contributions to Jewish culture and scholarship continue to be celebrated, and he remains an inspiration to those who seek to use their voices and talents to effect change.</p><p></p><p>
