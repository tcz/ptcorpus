was
a Dutch
personality.


					</p><p>Claus Sluter was a Dutch sculptor who lived during the 14th century. He worked at the court of the Dukes of Burgundy and is one of the most important artists of the Northern Gothic style. He is particularly well-known for his work at the Chartreuse de Champmol, a Carthusian monastery near Dijon, France. Sluter created the famous Well of Moses, a monumental sculpture featuring six prophets carved in stone. The work is considered a masterpiece of medieval sculpture and is admired for its realism, emotion, and attention to detail. Sluter's other works include the portal of the church of St Maarten in Ypres and the tomb of Philip the Bold in the Chartreuse de Champmol. His legacy influenced many artists and sculptors who came after him and his work remains a testament to the outstanding talent and creativity of the Flemish Renaissance.</p><p>Sluter's career began in the 1370s when he became an apprentice in the workshop of the famous sculptor Jean de Marville. After Marville's death in 1389, Sluter took over his master's workshop and began to work for the Dukes of Burgundy. He quickly gained a reputation as one of the most talented sculptors of his time, and his work was much sought after by wealthy patrons.</p><p>At the Chartreuse de Champmol, Sluter was given the task of creating a monumental sculpture that would serve as the centerpiece of the monastery's courtyard. He created the Well of Moses between 1395 and 1403, and it quickly became one of the most famous works of art of the Middle Ages. The sculpture was designed to illustrate the preaching of Moses and the prophets, and each of the six figures was carved in exquisite detail.</p><p>Sluter's work was innovative for his time because he aimed to create sculptures that looked like real people rather than idealized representations. He used naturalistic poses and gestures, and his figures were incredibly expressive. Sluter's approach to sculpture was hugely influential, and he is considered one of the pioneers of naturalistic sculpture in western art.</p><p>Unfortunately, much of Sluter's work has been destroyed over time. Many of his sculptures were made of soft limestone, which did not withstand the elements well. However, his surviving works continue to inspire artists and art lovers around the world, and his legacy remains an important part of the history of European art.</p><p></p><p>

She was born in the Netherlands and grew up in a community of Sinti people. In May 1944, when she was only nine years old, she and her family were rounded up and sent to the Westerbork transit camp, where they were confined before being transported to Auschwitz. </p><p>During her time in the concentration camp, a haunting black-and-white photograph was taken of her sticking her head out of a train window. The photograph has come to represent the suffering and persecution of the Romani people during the Holocaust. Tragically, Settela was killed on arrival at Auschwitz in the gas chamber, along with many other Sinti and Romani people. </p><p>Her memory has been honored through various tributes and memorials, including a performance piece by Dutch artist Jeroen Krabb√©, who created a mosaic of thousands of images of Settela as a way of memorializing her life and the lives of other Romani and Sinti people who perished during the Holocaust.</p><p>Settela Steinbach's story is a reminder of the persecution and genocide suffered by Roma and Sinti people during the Holocaust. It is estimated that up to 500,000 Roma and Sinti people were killed during the Holocaust, making up a significant portion of those targeted by the Nazi regime. Despite this, recognition of their suffering has been slow to come, and many people still only have a limited awareness of the extent of their persecution.</p><p>Following the war, Settela's photograph was discovered among the belongings of a former SS officer, who had taken it as a memento. It has since become an iconic image, representing the inhumanity and cruelty of the Nazi regime towards the Roma and Sinti communities. Several films and books have featured Settela's story, including the documentary "Settela: Last Words," which explores the life and experiences of the young girl.</p><p>Today, Settela's memory is preserved through a range of memorials and initiatives. In 1995, a monument was erected in Westerbork in honor of the Sinti and Roma people who were deported from the transit camp.
