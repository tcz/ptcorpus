a Polish
soldier.


					</p><p>Raginis was a commander during the German and Soviet invasion of Poland in World War II. He was known for his bravery, tactical skills, and dedication to his troops, who held their ground against the enemy against all odds. Despite suffering serious injuries during the battle, Raginis refused to retreat, instead insisting on continuing to fight alongside his men until the bitter end.</p><p>Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned, Raginis and his troops managed to inflict significant losses on the enemy, causing them to retreat. However, Raginis' injuries proved to be too severe, and he was forced to be left behind when his unit withdrew. Rather than surrendering to the enemy, Raginis took his own life with a grenade.
