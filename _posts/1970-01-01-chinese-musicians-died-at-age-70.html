In 1910, he traveled to the United States to further his studies, enrolling at Cornell University. There, he earned a degree in agriculture and went on to study philosophy at Columbia University. During his time in the United States, Hu Shih was exposed to the ideas of pragmatism, which would go on to influence his own philosophical and political views.</p><p>After completing his studies, Hu Shih returned to China to take up a teaching post at Peking University. He quickly became involved in the intellectual and political movements of the time, joining the New Culture Movement and advocating for the use of vernacular Chinese in literature and education. During the 1920s and 1930s, Hu Shih became one of China's most prominent thinkers and writers, penning influential essays and books on topics such as language, culture, and philosophy.</p><p>In addition to his intellectual pursuits, Hu Shih also served in several diplomatic and governmental roles.
