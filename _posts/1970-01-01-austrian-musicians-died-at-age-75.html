Among his most well-known achievements was the first ascent of Cho Oyu, the world's sixth-highest mountain, in 1954. He also made significant contributions to geology, having made the first geological survey of the Kishtwar region in the Indian Himalayas. In addition to his mountaineering and geological work, Tichy was also an accomplished author who wrote numerous books about his adventures and experiences, many of which became best-sellers translated into multiple languages. He was also a highly respected journalist, writing for various newspapers and magazines throughout his career. Tichy's legacy as a pioneering explorer and adventurer has had a lasting impact, inspiring many to follow in his footsteps and explore the world's highest peaks.</p><p>Tichy's love for adventure began at a young age, when he would explore the mountains near his home in Austria. After studying geology at the University of Vienna, he embarked on his first expedition to the Himalayas in 1936. He later served in World War II, during which he was captured and held as a prisoner of war for three years. </p><p>After the war, Tichy resumed his expeditions, making several notable climbs in the Alps and the Himalayas.

(February 8, 1897		Vienna-May 25, 1972			Chicago)


was
an Austrian
psychologist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work in the field of child psychology and for developing the theory of individual psychology. Dreikurs was influenced by the works of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, and he went on to become a prominent figure in the field of Adlerian psychology. He fled to the United States in 1937 due to the persecution of Jews in Austria and continued his work as a professor of psychiatry and psychology at the Chicago Medical School and later at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Dreikurs authored several books on psychology, including "Child Guidance," "The Challenge of Parenthood," and "Psychology in the Classroom." His theories have been widely adopted by educators and parents worldwide and are still used in psychology today.</p><p>In his later years, Dreikurs became increasingly interested in the intersection of psychology and social justice, and he used his platform to speak out against discrimination and prejudice. He was a founding member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment, an organization that promoted nonviolent resistance to social injustice. Dreikurs also worked closely with the United Nations, serving as a consultant on issues related to child development and education. Despite facing many challenges in his life, including the loss of two family members in the Holocaust, Dreikurs remained committed to making a positive difference in the world through his work in psychology.</p><p>Additionally, much of Dreikurs' work focused on understanding and addressing misbehavior in children. He believed that every child has a desire to belong and feel significant, and that misbehavior is often a result of children seeking attention or power when they feel they are not being seen or heard. Dreikurs developed a practical approach to discipline that emphasizes positive reinforcement, mutual respect, and problem-solving with children. This approach, which is known as Adlerian parenting, has been widely adopted by parents and educators around the world. In recognition of his contributions to the field of psychology, Dreikurs was awarded the American Psychological Association's Distinguished Professional Contribution Award in 1968. His legacy continues to inspire psychologists and educators to this day.</p><p>In addition to his work in psychology and child guidance, Rudolf Dreikurs was also a skilled teacher and lecturer. He was known for his engaging and interactive teaching style, which emphasized practical strategies for addressing behavioral issues in children. Dreikurs believed that teachers and parents should work together to create a positive and supportive environment for children, one that encourages them to develop their own unique strengths and talents. He also stressed the importance of understanding each child's individual needs and personality, and tailoring discipline strategies accordingly.</p><p>Dreikurs' work continues to influence the field of psychology today, particularly in the areas of child development and education. His emphasis on positive reinforcement and problem-solving has been adopted by many schools and parenting programs, and his theories on the importance of social belonging and recognition remain highly relevant today. In addition to his contributions in the realm of psychology, Dreikurs was also a dedicated humanitarian and advocate for social justice, and his legacy continues to inspire those working to create a more just and equitable world.</p><p></p><p>
