						</p><p>Julio Estrada is a Mexican composer and music theorist. He studied at the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City and later at the Hochschule für Musik in Cologne, Germany. Estrada's music is characterized by its use of microtonality, non-Western tuning systems, and an interest in the acoustics of sound. He has used traditional instruments from Mexico and other cultures, as well as electronic and computer-generated sounds in his compositions. Estrada has received numerous awards and commissions for his work and has been a guest lecturer at several universities and festivals around the world. He currently resides in France where he continues to compose and teach.</p><p>Estrada was born in Mexico City in 1943 to a family of artists and intellectuals. His grandfather was a composer and his mother was a pianist. Estrada began his music studies at the age of six and later attended the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City, where he studied composition with Mario Lavista and Rodolfo Halffter. In 1968, he received a scholarship to study in Germany, where he studied with Karlheinz Stockhausen and Mauricio Kagel. </p><p>Inspired by the music and instruments of indigenous Mexican cultures, Estrada began to incorporate non-Western tuning systems and microtonality into his compositions. He also became interested in the acoustics of sound, and has used techniques such as spectral analysis and sonogram analysis to explore the properties of sound.  </p><p>Over the course of his career, Estrada has received commissions from ensembles and festivals around the world, including the Ensemble Intercontemporain, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Holland Festival. He has also been a guest lecturer at institutions such as Harvard University, Columbia University, and Princeton University. </p><p>In addition to his work as a composer, Estrada has also been a pioneering figure in the field of music theory. He has developed a new notation system for microtonal music, and has written a number of essays and articles on topics such as spectral analysis and the use of new technologies in music. </p><p>Despite the complexity of his music, Estrada remains committed to communicating his ideas to a wide audience. In a 2013 interview with the journal Perspectives of New Music, he stated, "I believe that the language of music can and should be rich and complex, but it should also be able to communicate with anyone who wants to listen."</p><p></p><p>
