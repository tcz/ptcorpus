He rose to popularity in the 1970s with films such as "Było sobie miasteczko" ("Once Upon a Time There Was a Town") and "Poszukiwany, poszukiwana" ("Man Wanted, Woman Wanted"). His films were frequently censored by the government but still managed to draw large audiences. Bareja was also a popular actor, often appearing in his own films as well as in the works of other directors. Despite his success, Bareja was known for his modesty and down-to-earth personality. His sudden death in 1987 from a heart attack at the age of 57 came as a shock to many in the Polish film community.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=4036764" title="Wikipedia article about Stanisław Bareja">Stanisław Bareja on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/polish-actors-died-at-age-59.html' title='Polish actors died at age 59'><strong>Polish actors died at age 59</strong> List of the top 2 Polish actors who died when they were 59</a></li><li><a href='/american-actors-died-at-age-37.html' title='American actors died at age 37'><strong>American actors died at age 37</strong> List of the top 5 American actors who died when they were 37</a></li><li><a href='/croatian-actors-died-in-2005.html' title='Croatian actors died in 2005'><strong>Croatian actors died in 2005</strong> List of the top 1 Croatian actors who died in 2005</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-1965.html' title='American actors died in 1965'><strong>American actors died in 1965</strong> List of the top 47 American actors who died in 1965</a></li><li><a href='/czech-musicians-died-at-age-67.html' title='Czech musicians died at age 67'><strong>Czech musicians died at age 67</strong> List of the top 18 Czech music stars who died when they were 67</a></li><li><a href='/indonesian-musicians-died-at-age-59.html' title='Indonesian musicians died at age 59'><strong>Indonesian musicians died at age 59</strong> List of the top 8 Indonesian music stars who died when they were 59</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
