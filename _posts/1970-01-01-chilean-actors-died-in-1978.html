							Serrador had a prolific career spanning over four decades, and was one of the most well-known actors in Chile during his time. He began his career in the 1930s, appearing in numerous films including "El HÃºsar de la Muerte" (The Death Hussar) and "Subterra" (The Underground). He also worked extensively in theater, starring in plays such as "La Casa de Bernarda Alba" (The House of Bernarda Alba) and "La Loca de Chaillot" (The Madwoman of Chaillot).</p><p>In addition to his acting work, Serrador was a prominent figure in Chilean cultural circles, and was involved in the founding of the National School of Dramatic Art in 1941. He was also an important influence on many young actors and filmmakers, and helped to shape the direction of Chilean cinema throughout his career.</p><p>Despite his significant contributions to the arts in Chile, Serrador's legacy has been somewhat overshadowed by his controversial political views. In the 1970s, he became involved with the far-right movement in Chile and was a supporter of the military coup that brought Augusto Pinochet to power. This has led to criticism of Serrador's work and his legacy in recent years.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=31018234" title="Wikipedia article about Esteban Serrador">Esteban Serrador on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/czechoslovakian-actors-died-at-age-56.html' title='Czechoslovakian actors died at age 56'><strong>Czechoslovakian actors died at age 56</strong> List of the top 1 Czechoslovakian actors who died when they were 56</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-actors-died-in-myocardial-infarction.html' title='Canadian actors died in Myocardial infarction'><strong>Canadian actors died in Myocardial infarction</strong> List of the top 32 Canadian actors who died in Myocardial infarction</a></li><li><a href='/filipino-actresses-died-in-lung-cancer.html' title='Filipino actresses died in Lung cancer'><strong>Filipino actresses died in Lung cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Filipino actresses who died in Lung cancer</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-hypotension.html' title='Famous musicians died in Hypotension'><strong>Famous musicians died in Hypotension</strong> List of the top 1 Famous music stars who died in Hypotension</a></li><li><a href='/pakistani-actors-died-in-1973.html' title='Pakistani actors died in 1973'><strong>Pakistani actors died in 1973</strong> List of the top 1 Pakistani actors who died in 1973</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-actresses-died-at-age-79.html' title='Japanese actresses died at age 79'><strong>Japanese actresses died at age 79</strong> List of the top 1 Japanese actresses who died when they were 79</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
