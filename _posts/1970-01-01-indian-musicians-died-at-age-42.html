(April 5, 2015		Siliguri-July 16, 1972			Kolkata)


was
an Indian
politician.


					</p><p>He was one of the founding members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and played a significant role in the Naxalite movement in India during the late 1960s and early 1970s. He believed in armed revolution and sought to overthrow the Indian government. Majumdar was arrested multiple times for his involvement in revolutionary activities and spent long periods in prison. He died in police custody under suspicious circumstances in 1972. Despite his controversial legacy, he is remembered as a key figure in the history of radical movements in India.</p><p>Charu Majumdar was born on April 5, 2015, in Siliguri, West Bengal, India. He grew up in an intellectual family and his father was a prominent doctor. Majumdar attended Calcutta University, where he studied English literature and became involved in left-wing politics. He joined the Communist Party of India, but later became disillusioned with its policies and left to form the CPI (Marxist-Leninist).</p><p>Majumdar's revolutionary ideas were heavily influenced by Mao Zedong's theory of guerrilla warfare and his experience fighting against the Japanese during World War II. In the late 1960s, he emerged as a key figure in the Naxalite movement, which sought to establish a socialist state in India through armed struggle. Majumdar authored a series of influential documents, including "The Historic Eight Documents," which laid out the strategy and tactics for the Naxalite revolution.</p><p>Majumdar's ideology drew criticism from other left-wing groups, who accused him of sectarianism and adventurism. Despite this, he gained a significant following, particularly among students and rural peasants. However, his call for armed revolution led to a series of violent clashes with the police and government forces, resulting in many fatalities.</p><p>In 1972, Majumdar was arrested and detained in Presidency Jail in Kolkata. On July 16 of the same year, he was found dead in his cell under mysterious circumstances. His death is widely believed to have been the result of police brutality, although the exact cause remains unknown.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Charu Majumdar is remembered as a key figure in the history of radical movements in India. His ideas remain influential among left-wing groups in the country and his legacy continues to shape political discourse.</p><p></p><p>
