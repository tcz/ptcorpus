(July 11, 1811		Frankfurt-September 23, 1869			Jena)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a scholar and philologist known for his work in Albanology, the study of the Albanian language and culture. He spent many years traveling in the Balkans and studying the Albanian language, eventually publishing a comprehensive study of Albanian myths and folklore. He also worked as a diplomat for the Austrian Empire, serving in various posts throughout the Balkans. In addition to his work on Albanian culture, he was a prolific writer on linguistics and comparative mythology. His contributions to the field of Albanology are still considered foundational today.</p><p>Hahn was born in Frankfurt in 1811 to a wealthy family. He received his education at the universities of Giessen and Munich, where he studied classical philology, archaeology, and modern languages. In 1834, he was appointed as a teacher at the University of Jena, where he would spend the rest of his academic career.</p><p>Hahn's interest in the Albanian language began during his travels in the Balkans in the mid-19th century. He became fascinated with the language and the people who spoke it, and he dedicated much of his life to studying Albanian culture and mythology. In 1854, he published his groundbreaking work, "Albanische Studien," which drew on years of fieldwork, interviews with Albanian peasants, and original literary sources to create a comprehensive study of Albanian myths and folklore.</p><p>In addition to his work on Albanian culture, Hahn made significant contributions to the study of comparative mythology, folklore, and linguistics. He was a prolific writer, publishing numerous articles and books on these subjects. He was also a respected diplomat, serving as consul and ambassador for the Austrian Empire in various posts throughout the Balkans.</p><p>Hahn died in Jena in 1869, at the age of 58. His work on Albanian culture and language continues to be celebrated today, and he is considered one of the founding fathers of Albanology.</p><p>Hahn's travels and studies in the Balkans were not without danger. He was a witness to the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1853 and became a prisoner of war in Russia for a short time. However, he continued to travel and study the Albanian language and culture despite the risks. His dedication to his work earned him significant recognition during his lifetime, including an honorary doctorate from the University of Jena in 1860. Hahn's legacy is still felt today in the field of Albanology, and his work remains an important resource for scholars and historians studying Albanian culture and language.</p><p></p><p>

(January 27, 1883		Würzburg-September 24, 1941			Murnau am Staffelsee)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was an economist, publicist and politician, known for his involvement in the early development of the Nazi Party. Feder was a key member of the party and played a major role in shaping its economic policies. He is best known for his book "Manifesto for the Abolition of Interest Slavery", which was a critique of the banking system and proposed a radical restructuring of the economy. Feder was appointed to the post of Reich Minister of Economics in 1933, but he fell out of favour with Adolf Hitler and was soon replaced. Despite his contributions to the party, Feder's influence waned over time, and he ultimately died in obscurity in 1941.</p><p>Feder was born into a middle-class family and studied engineering in Munich before turning to economics. He was deeply influenced by the German philosopher Oswald Spengler and believed that the decline of Western civilization was due to the corrupting influence of the financial system. Feder's ideas on economics played an important role in the Nazi Party's rise to power, and he helped to develop their platform of national socialism. </p><p>Feder's views on economics were controversial, even within the Nazi Party. While he opposed capitalism and the international banking system, he also rejected Marxist socialism and advocated for a form of socialism that was grounded in the interests of the German people. Many of his economic proposals, such as the nationalization of banks and industries, were implemented during the early years of Hitler's regime. </p><p>Despite his initial success within the Nazi Party, Feder fell out of favor with Hitler and other party leaders. He was criticized for his outspokenness and was eventually removed from his post as Reich Minister of Economics in 1934. Feder withdrew from politics and lived in seclusion until his death in 1941. Despite his later marginalization, Feder's ideas on economics continued to influence fascist movements throughout Europe in the years leading up to World War II.</p><p>Feder's influence on the economic policies of the Nazi Party was significant. He was a strong advocate of autarky, or economic self-sufficiency, and argued that Germany could only achieve true independence if it broke free from the influence of international finance capital. Feder also believed that Jewish influence on the banking system was a major factor contributing to the decline of the German economy.</p><p>In addition to his economic writings, Feder was also a prolific public speaker. His speeches on economics and politics often drew large crowds and his impassioned rhetoric helped to galvanize support for the Nazi Party in its early years.</p><p>Despite his role in crafting the economic policies of the Nazi Party, Feder was not involved in the implementation of the Holocaust or other atrocities committed by the regime during World War II. Nevertheless, his association with the Nazi Party has made him a controversial figure in modern times, and his economic ideas have been heavily criticized for their anti-Semitic and authoritarian tendencies.</p><p></p><p>

(March 1, 1736		Hanover-November 1, 1794			Killarney)


was
a German
writer.


					</p><p>He is best known for creating the fictional character of Baron Munchausen, a nobleman known for his incredible and often exaggerated tales of adventures and travels. The character first appeared in Raspe's book "Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia" in 1785, and has since become a cultural icon around the world. Apart from his writing, Raspe was also a scientist and geologist, and made important contributions in the field of mineralogy. He worked as a curator and librarian in various institutions across Europe, including the British Museum in London. Raspe's life was marked by constant travels and financial struggles, and he eventually passed away in Ireland at the age of 58.</p><p>During his lifetime, Raspe was considered a prolific writer and translator. In addition to the Munchausen stories, he authored several books on geology and mineralogy, including "A Description of the Minerals in the Leskean Museum at Göttingen" and "A Catalogue of the Different Specimens of Cloth Collected in the Three Voyages of Captain Cook." Raspe was also known for his work in the field of numismatics, and produced several books and articles on the subject.</p><p>Despite his contributions to science, Raspe's legacy today is primarily associated with the Munchausen character. The stories have been adapted into numerous films, plays, and other forms of media, and the character's name has become synonymous with exaggeration and tall tales. In addition, the character of Baron Munchausen has been used in advertising campaigns for products ranging from beer to electronics.</p><p>Raspe's life has been the subject of several biographies, including "The True Story of Baron Munchausen" by Rudolf Erich Raspe, and "The Fabulous Baron Munchausen" by Raymond Hargreaves. His work continues to be celebrated by fans around the world, and the Munchausen character remains popular today.</p><p>In addition to his writing, scientific, and numismatic pursuits, Raspe was also a prominent member of the Masonic community. He was initiated into a Masonic Lodge in London in 1776 and later became a member of several other lodges in Europe. Raspe's involvement in the Masonic community is said to have influenced several of his works, including the Munchausen stories. Some scholars have suggested that the character's exaggerated tales and miraculous feats were inspired by the Masonic tradition of using allegorical stories to teach moral lessons.</p><p></p><p>

(October 16, 1720		Winterthur-February 27, 1779			Berlin)


was
a German
philosopher.


					</p><p>Sulzer is best known for his contribution to aesthetics and art theory, particularly for his influential work "Allgemeine Theorie der Schönen Künste" (General Theory of the Fine Arts), which was published in multiple editions and translated into several languages. He also wrote on other topics in philosophy, such as metaphysics, ethics, and logic. Sulzer was appointed to the court of Frederick the Great of Prussia as a philosopher and librarian and spent the rest of his life in Berlin. He was a member of several learned societies and corresponded with some of the most prominent thinkers of his time, including Immanuel Kant and Moses Mendelssohn. Sulzer's work had a significant impact on the development of German aesthetics in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p><p>His philosophy emphasized the importance of experiencing beauty and the emotions it elicits, and he argued that this experience can lead to a greater understanding of human nature and the world. In addition to his contributions to philosophy, Sulzer was also an accomplished musician and wrote several works on music theory. His ideas on the relationship between music and philosophy influenced later thinkers such as Friedrich Nietzsche. Sulzer's legacy continues to be felt in the fields of aesthetics and music theory, and his General Theory of the Fine Arts remains a seminal work in the history of these disciplines.</p><p>Sulzer was born in Winterthur, Switzerland and trained in theology and philosophy at the University of Zurich. He began his career as a teacher and pastor, but eventually decided to focus on philosophical writing. His first major work was "Vernünftige Gedanken von Gott, der Welt und der Seele des Menschen, auch allen Dingen überhaupt" (Rational Thoughts on God, the World, and the Soul of Man, as well as on All Things in General), which was published in 1751 and became a popular introductory text on metaphysics.</p><p>Sulzer's interests in aesthetics and art theory were sparked by his involvement in the literary and artistic circles of Zurich, where he met prominent writers and thinkers such as Salomon Gessner and Johann Jakob Bodmer. He traveled to Paris and other European cities in the 1750s and 1760s to further his studies and expand his network of contacts.</p><p>Sulzer's work on music theory, which included an emphasis on how musical form expresses emotions, was particularly innovative for its time. He argued that music could convey emotions that were difficult to express in words, and that it had the power to move listeners in a profound way. His ideas on the relationship between music and philosophy influenced later thinkers such as Friedrich Nietzsche.</p><p>In addition to his philosophical and musical pursuits, Sulzer was also a prolific writer of letters and essays on a wide range of topics, including politics and education. He was known for his avoidance of controversy and his gentle and moderate tone. His correspondence with Immanuel Kant, for example, was marked by mutual respect and admiration.</p><p>Sulzer's lasting impact on the fields of aesthetics and philosophy can be seen in the continuing interest in his work and the influence it has had on subsequent generations of writers and thinkers.</p><p></p><p>

(August 1, 1881		Wrocław-February 15, 1940			Jerusalem)


was
a German
mathematician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work in the field of matrix theory, where he made significant contributions to the study of determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Toeplitz received his doctoral degree from the University of Berlin in 1905 under the supervision of Hermann Amandus Schwarz, and later became a professor at the University of Bonn. In 1933, he was forced to flee Germany due to the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party, and eventually settled in Palestine, where he became a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Despite the difficulties he faced as a Jewish refugee, Toeplitz continued to work on mathematics and published several important papers during his time in Palestine. He also played a vital role in the development of mathematics in Israel, founding the Association of the Mathematicians of Israel and serving as the first president of the Israel Mathematical Union. Toeplitz was a highly esteemed mathematician and his legacy continues to influence the field of matrix theory today.</p><p>In addition to his work in matrix theory, Otto Toeplitz also made notable contributions to other areas of mathematics, such as number theory, functional analysis, and differential equations. He was a prolific writer and authored several influential books, including "The Calculus: A Genetic Approach", which became a classic in the field of calculus. Toeplitz also collaborated closely with other prominent mathematicians of his time, such as David Hilbert, Felix Klein, and Ernst Fischer, and was a member of various prestigious organizations, including the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Despite facing discrimination and persecution as a Jew in Nazi Germany, Toeplitz maintained a deeply-held sense of patriotism for his country and its intellectual tradition, and continued to write and speak in German throughout his life. Today, he is remembered as a brilliant mathematician and an inspiring testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.</p><p>Toeplitz's legacy is greatly influenced by his contributions to the field of matrix theory. He developed the Toeplitz matrix, which is a matrix with each descending diagonal having constant values. This type of matrix is widely used in signal processing, digital signal processing, and other areas of communication engineering. Toeplitz matrices have also played an important role in the study of partial differential equations, where they are used to discretize differential operators. Moreover, Toeplitz developed the famous Toeplitz determinant formula, which is used to compute determinants of certain Toeplitz matrices. His work has greatly expanded the understanding of matrix theory, and continues to influence mathematical research today. </p><p>In addition to his research contributions, Toeplitz was also dedicated to teaching and mentoring young mathematicians. Many of his students went on to become successful mathematicians in their own right, and he is remembered as an individual with a deep commitment to his discipline and his students. Toeplitz died in Jerusalem in 1940, leaving behind a legacy of mathematical achievement that serves as an inspiration to future generations of mathematicians.</p><p></p><p>

(May 4, 1880		Königsberg-December 24, 1938			Istanbul)


was
a German
architect and urban planner.


					</p><p>He was a prominent member of the German Expressionist movement and was known for his use of vibrant colors and his innovative designs. Taut is perhaps best known for his housing projects, which aimed to provide affordable and comfortable living spaces for lower-income families. He also wrote extensively on architecture and urban planning, and his work helped to shape the modernist movement in Germany. In the 1920s, Taut was forced to leave Germany due to the rise of the Nazi party, and he spent the rest of his life living and working in countries such as Japan and Turkey. Despite his controversial and often provocative style, Taut remains a significant figure in the history of modern architecture, and his legacy continues to inspire architects and designers today.</p><p>Taut began his architectural career working for a number of prominent firms in Berlin, including those of Otto March and Peter Behrens. In 1914, he co-founded the progressive architectural group known as the Glass Chain, which included such luminaries as Walter Gropius, Paul Scheerbart, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. During World War I, Taut served in the German army as a draftsman, but after the war, he returned to his architectural practice with renewed energy and enthusiasm.</p><p>Taut's early designs were heavily influenced by Arts and Crafts and Jugendstil movements, but he soon developed his own distinctive style, characterized by bold colors, ornamental details, and a playful, whimsical approach to form. Many of his most famous works, such as the colorful housing estates of Britz and Hufeisensiedlung in Berlin, were created during the Weimar Republic era, when the German government was actively promoting the construction of new, affordable housing for working-class citizens. </p><p>In addition to his architectural work, Taut was also an accomplished writer and theorist. He authored several influential books on architecture and urban planning, including "Die Stadtkrone" (The City Crown) and "Alpine Architecture", which articulated his vision of a more human-centered, sustainable approach to urban design. In 1933, after the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany, Taut was among the many artists and intellectuals who were forced into exile. He spent his remaining years living and working in a number of different countries, including Japan, Turkey, and the Soviet Union, where he continued to influence the development of modern architecture and urban planning until his death in 1938.</p><p>Taut's work and philosophy were shaped by his belief in the power of architecture to shape society and improve the lives of ordinary people. He saw architecture not just as a means of creating buildings, but as a way of shaping the urban fabric and creating a more just and equitable society. Taut believed that architecture had the power to transform society by improving living conditions, promoting social equality, and creating beautiful and harmonious environments. His work has been described as a "utopian" vision of a better world, one in which the built environment is designed to serve the needs of people rather than those of the elite.</p><p>One of Taut's most famous works is the Glass Pavilion he designed for the Cologne Werkbund Exhibition in 1914. The pavilion was a masterpiece of modernist design, featuring a transparent glass structure that reflected the light and surrounding environment. Taut's use of glass was innovative for its time, as was his rejection of traditional ornamentation in favor of a more streamlined, functional approach.</p><p>After leaving Germany, Taut continued to work on architectural projects in other countries. In Japan, he became involved with the movement to promote the use of traditional Japanese techniques and materials in modern architecture, and he worked on designs for a number of buildings that combined Western modernism with Japanese forms and styles. In Turkey, he worked on a number of housing projects, including the Kemer Country Hotel and the Istanbul Gymnasium, both of which reflected his commitment to creating comfortable, functional, and beautiful spaces for people to live and work in.</p><p>Taut's legacy has continued to inspire architects and designers around the world, and his ideas about the importance of social justice, sustainability, and human-centered design continue to be relevant today. His work and philosophy have had a profound impact on the development of modern architecture and urban planning, and his innovative designs and visionary ideas continue to be celebrated and studied by scholars and enthusiasts alike.</p><p></p><p>

(February 11, 1816		Berlin-December 27, 1874			Wiesbaden)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was known for inventing the Litfaßsäule or the advertising column, which is a cylindrical pillar covered in advertisements. These columns can be seen throughout major cities in Germany and have become an iconic feature of the streetscape. The idea behind the columns was to reduce the amount of random posters and advertisements that were being plastered onto buildings and walls, which had become a nuisance for Berliners. Litfaß's invention proved to be successful and he even established a company to promote and maintain the columns. In addition to his invention, Litfaß was also a successful printer and publisher, and opened a newspaper called Die Woche in 1854. His contributions to urban advertising have left a lasting impact on German culture and history.</p><p>Ernst Litfaß was born into a family of printers and publishers in Berlin. After completing his studies, he worked in various printing and publishing houses in Germany and abroad. In 1842, he returned to Berlin and started his own small printing business. He soon became a renowned printer and publisher, printing newspapers, magazines, and books.</p><p>The idea for the advertising column came to Litfaß in 1854 when he noticed the growing chaos of posters and advertisements in Berlin. To combat this, he proposed the idea of a column covered with advertisements only. His proposal was accepted by the Berlin city authorities, and the first advertising column was installed in 1855.</p><p>The invention was an instant hit and soon spread to other German cities. Litfaß eventually established a company to manufacture, install, and maintain the columns, and the firm became very successful. Today, there are over 300,000 columns in Germany, and they continue to be an important part of the urban landscape.</p><p>In addition to his work as a printer and publisher, Litfaß was also involved in politics. He was a member of the Berlin city council and served as a member of the Prussian parliament.</p><p>Ernst Litfaß died in Wiesbaden in 1874, but his legacy lives on. The advertising column is now a familiar sight not just in Germany, but in many other countries as well.</p><p>Apart from his invention of the advertising column, Ernst Litfaß is also remembered for his contributions to journalism in Germany. In 1854, he launched a weekly newspaper called Die Woche, which won the hearts of readers with its excellent reporting and analysis of the events of the day. This publication played an important role in shaping public opinion during a critical period in Germany's history.</p><p>Litfaß was also a philanthropist and social reformer. He was deeply concerned about the welfare of the working class and used his wealth and influence to assist various charitable causes. He donated generously to organizations that provided education, healthcare, and other essential services to the underprivileged sections of society.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to German society, Litfaß was awarded the prestigious Order of the Red Eagle in 1873. His legacy as a pioneering entrepreneur, journalist, and social reformer continues to inspire generations of Germans even today.</p><p></p><p>

(April 17, 1933		Zabrze-July 1, 1991			Rheinbach)

	
		a.k.a. Ruhr Cannibal or Duisburg Man-Eater

	
was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Joachim Kroll was a notorious serial killer who was responsible for the murders of at least thirteen young girls and women between 1955 and 1976. He was known for his cannibalistic tendencies, and earned the nickname "Ruhr Cannibal" or "Duisburg Man-Eater." Kroll's killing spree came to an end when a neighbor reported him for dumping body parts in a local river. When police searched his home, they found an array of gruesome souvenirs, including human body parts and a collection of newspaper clippings about his crimes. Kroll was arrested, tried and found guilty of his crimes. He was sentenced to life in prison, where he died of a heart attack at the age of 58. Despite the horrifying nature of his crimes, Kroll remains an object of fascination for true-crime enthusiasts and psychologists, who continue to study the mind of a killer.</p><p>Joachim Kroll was born on April 17, 1933 in Zabrze, Poland. He grew up in poverty and faced abuse from his stepfather. As a result, he dropped out of school at the age of 14 and worked several odd jobs. Kroll was drafted into the German army in 1955 but was discharged only after 90 days due to medical reasons. Following his discharge, he traveled to several different cities, working as a gardener and handyman.</p><p>Kroll's first known victim was a four-year-old girl whom he sexually assaulted and strangled in 1955. Over the next two decades, he continued to target young girls and women who were vulnerable and easily accessible. Most of his victims were strangled or suffocated, and he often mutilated and cannibalized their bodies.</p><p>Despite his disturbing behavior, Kroll managed to avoid suspicion for many years. He was eventually caught in 1976, thanks to a combination of luck and quick thinking by the neighbor who reported him to the police. Kroll initially denied any involvement in the murders, but eventually confessed to the crimes and took police officers to the locations where he had disposed of his victims' remains.</p><p>Kroll's trial took place in 1982, and he was found guilty of eight murders. He was sentenced to life in prison, where he spent the rest of his days. While in prison, Kroll was diagnosed with borderline mental retardation and other psychiatric disorders. He died of a heart attack on July 1, 1991 in Rheinbach, Germany.</p><p>Kroll's crimes were particularly disturbing due to his cannibalistic tendencies. Police found evidence that he had eaten parts of his victims' bodies, including their organs and flesh. He also kept body parts as souvenirs, including skulls, bones, and genitalia. Kroll's behavior shocked the German public and sparked widespread outrage.</p><p>After his arrest and conviction, Kroll became the subject of numerous studies by psychologists and criminologists. Many researchers focused on his childhood experiences, including his abusive stepfather and impoverished upbringing, as potential explanations for his violent behavior. Kroll's case also raised questions about the effectiveness of the German criminal justice system, as he was able to continue his killing spree for over two decades without getting caught.</p><p>Today, Kroll's crimes are still remembered as some of the most heinous in modern German history. His case has influenced the way that law enforcement officials investigate serial killers and has led to the development of new techniques for profiling violent criminals. Despite the trauma that he inflicted on his victims and their families, Kroll's legacy serves as a stark reminder of the destructive power of unchecked violence and the importance of preventing similar tragedies from happening again in the future.</p><p></p><p>

His work was often political and satirical, tackling major themes such as religion and nationalism. He was a proponent of liberal democracy and free speech, making him a controversial figure in his time.</p><p>Despite his success as a writer, Heine faced criticism and censorship from the German authorities for his political views. He was forced to leave Germany in 1831 and spent the rest of his life in exile in Paris. Despite this, he continued to write and publish prolifically, becoming a prominent figure in European literary circles.</p><p>Heine's work has had a lasting impact on German literature and culture. His poetry has been set to music by numerous composers, and his satirical writing has been cited as an influence by writers such as Mark Twain and George Orwell. He is remembered as a pioneering figure in German Romanticism and a champion of free speech and political reform.</p><p>Heinrich Heine was born into a Jewish family and was baptized as a Protestant in 1825 in order to gain access to higher education and join the German literary elite. Although he converted to Christianity, he remained critical of organized religion and wrote satirical works that were often banned by German censors. His most famous works include "Die Lorelei," "Romanzero," and "Deutschland. Ein Wintermärchen" (Germany. A Winter's Tale), which was a critique of German nationalism and anti-Semitism.</p><p>Despite his exile, Heine maintained friendships with prominent figures such as Karl Marx, Richard Wagner, and Victor Hugo. He also suffered from various health problems throughout his life, including a spinal disease that left him bedridden for the last eight years of his life.  </p><p>In addition to his literary achievements, Heine is also known for his aphorisms and witty remarks, such as "When words leave off, music begins" and "Thinking is easy, acting is difficult, and to put one's thoughts into action is the most difficult thing in the world."</p><p>Heinrich Heine was a prolific writer, producing works in a variety of genres ranging from lyric poetry to travelogues. He was noted for his ability to combine humor and irony with poignant reflections on human nature, making his works accessible to a wide audience. In addition to his German works, he also wrote in French, contributing to the development of modern French literature. Heine's impact on literature and philosophy extended beyond Germany and France; his works influenced the development of existentialism and psychoanalysis.</p><p>Heine's personal life was not without tragedy. He suffered from unrequited love for his cousin Amalie, who rejected his proposal and married someone else. He married Mathilde, who was not Jewish and was herself a writer, but the marriage was not a happy one. They had no children and were estranged later in life, with Heine accusing her of infidelity. Despite these difficulties, Heine remained devoted to his writing, stating that "My books are my children."</p><p>Today, Heine is celebrated as a major literary figure in Germany and throughout the world.
