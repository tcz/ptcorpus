He made seminal contributions to the field of quantum field theory, in particular the development of the method of Bogolyubov transformations, which is widely used to this day.

							Ktorov was known for his work in theater, film, and voice acting. He started his career as a theater actor in Moscow, where he appeared in productions of prominent playwrights such as Anton Chekhov and Maxim Gorky. He later transitioned to film acting and became a prominent figure in the Soviet film industry. Ktorov is perhaps best known for his roles in the classic Soviet films "The Return of Vasil Bortnikov" and "The Circus". </p><p>As a voice actor, Ktorov lent his voice to various animation projects, including the Russian dub of Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". His clear, sonorous voice made him a natural fit for voice acting and helped him to become a sought-after voice actor in the Soviet Union. </p><p>Despite his success, Ktorov faced challenges during the Stalin era for his Jewish background. He was briefly imprisoned and banned from working in the film industry for a period of time. However, he was able to return to his acting career and continued to work until his death in 1980.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=30379778" title="Wikipedia article about Anatoli Ktorov">Anatoli Ktorov on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-1956.html' title='American actors died in 1956'><strong>American actors died in 1956</strong> List of the top 45 American actors who died in 1956</a></li><li><a href='/turkish-actors-died-in-1985.html' title='Turkish actors died in 1985'><strong>Turkish actors died in 1985</strong> List of the top 2 Turkish actors who died in 1985</a></li><li><a href='/italian-actors-died-in-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis.html' title='Italian actors died in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'><strong>Italian actors died in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</strong> List of the top 1 Italian actors who died in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/brazilian-actors-died-in-1973.html' title='Brazilian actors died in 1973'><strong>Brazilian actors died in 1973</strong> List of the top 1 Brazilian actors who died in 1973</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-actors-died-in-1964.html' title='Japanese actors died in 1964'><strong>Japanese actors died in 1964</strong> List of the top 1 Japanese actors who died in 1964</a></li><li><a href='/german-musicians-died-at-age-34.html' title='German musicians died at age 34'><strong>German musicians died at age 34</strong> List of the top 6 German music stars who died when they were 34</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
