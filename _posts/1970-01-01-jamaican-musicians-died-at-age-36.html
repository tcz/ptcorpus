						Bob Marley is considered one of the pioneers of reggae music and his music has had a massive impact on the development of the genre. He was born to a white Jamaican mother and a black Jamaican father, and spent most of his childhood in poverty in the rural village of Nine Mile. Marley became involved in the music scene in Kingston, Jamaica in the early 1960s, and formed the band The Wailers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.</p><p>Throughout his career, Marley's music was heavily influenced by his Rastafarian faith, which promoted peace, love, and unity. He became a voice for social justice and political liberation, and his lyrics often dealt with themes of oppression, poverty, and inequality. His songs "Get Up, Stand Up" and "Redemption Song" became anthems for the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements.</p><p>In addition to his music, Marley was also known for his philanthropic work and his dedication to promoting peace and unity between the African diaspora. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.</p><p>Overall, Bob Marley's legacy as a musician and activist continues to inspire and influence people all over the world to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=8239846" title="Wikipedia article about Bob Marley">Bob Marley on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Carlton &quot;Carly&quot; Barrett</h2><p><strong>Carlton &quot;Carly&quot; Barrett</strong>

						Carlton "Carly" Barrett was a prominent member of The Wailers, a reggae band led by Bob Marley. He started playing the drums at a young age and later formed a duo with his younger brother, Aston Barrett, called The Barrett Brothers. The duo became session musicians at the famous Studio One in Kingston, Jamaica, which led to them being recruited by Bob Marley for his band.</p><p>Barrett's drumming style was distinct and innovative, incorporating elements of rock, funk, and jazz into reggae music. His contributions can be heard on many of Bob Marley's most famous albums, including "Catch a Fire," "Burnin'," and "Natty Dread."</p><p>Tragically, Barrett's life was cut short when he was shot and killed outside of his Kingston home in 1987. His death was later attributed to a contract killing, although the identity of his killer was never confirmed. Barrett's legacy as one of reggae's greatest drummers remains strong, and his innovative style continues to influence musicians around the world.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=3784854" title="Wikipedia article about Carlton &quot;Carly&quot; Barrett">Carlton &quot;Carly&quot; Barrett on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/british-musicians-died-at-age-44.html' title='British musicians died at age 44'><strong>British musicians died at age 44</strong> List of the top 5 British music stars who died when they were 44</a></li><li><a href='/dutch-musicians-born-in-1962.html' title='Dutch musicians born in 1962'><strong>Dutch musicians born in 1962</strong> List of the top 7 Dutch  music stars who died in who were born in 1962</a></li><li><a href='/hungarian-actresses-died-in-1963.html' title='Hungarian actresses died in 1963'><strong>Hungarian actresses died in 1963</strong> List of the top 1 Hungarian actresses who died in 1963</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/pakistani-musicians-died-at-age-47.html' title='Pakistani musicians died at age 47'><strong>Pakistani musicians died at age 47</strong> List of the top 6 Pakistani music stars who died when they were 47</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-actresses-died-in-1967.html' title='Japanese actresses died in 1967'><strong>Japanese actresses died in 1967</strong> List of the top 1 Japanese actresses who died in 1967</a></li><li><a href='/swiss-musicians-died-at-age-46.html' title='Swiss musicians died at age 46'><strong>Swiss musicians died at age 46</strong> List of the top 6 Swiss music stars who died when they were 46</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
