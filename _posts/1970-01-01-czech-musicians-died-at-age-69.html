After retiring from teaching, he moved to Moscow, where he continued to work on mathematical problems until his death in 1866.</p><p>Brashman was particularly interested in the study of elliptic functions and their relation to algebraic equations. He wrote several books on this subject, including "Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum" and "Theorie der algebraischen Gleichungen". His work on number theory included research on diophantine equations and their solutions. In addition to his mathematical achievements, Brashman was also known for his dedication to teaching and mentoring his students. Many of his pupils went on to become successful mathematicians and scientists themselves. Today, Brashman's legacy lives on through the Brashman Prize, which is awarded to mathematicians for outstanding achievements in the field of number theory.</p><p>Brashman was married twice and had eight children. His son, Karel Brashman, also became a mathematician and followed in his father's footsteps by teaching at Charles University. Brashman was known for his quiet and introverted nature, and preferred to spend his time focusing on his mathematical research. He was also an avid collector of rare books and manuscripts, and his personal library was considered one of the finest in the country. In recognition of his contributions to the field of mathematics, Brashman was awarded several prestigious honors during his lifetime, including the Gold Medal of the Royal Society in Göttingen and the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London. He is remembered today as one of the most important mathematicians of the 19th century, and his work continues to inspire and influence mathematicians around the world.</p><p></p><p>
