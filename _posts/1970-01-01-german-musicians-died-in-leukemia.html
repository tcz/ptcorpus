(September 5, 1895		Berlin-August 19, 1929			Dresden)


was
a German
singer.


					</p><p>She specialized in operatic roles and was known for her clear and powerful soprano voice. Seinemeyer made her operatic debut in 1919 and quickly became a leading soprano in Germany. She performed in many notable productions, including Richard Strauss's "Salome" and "Der Rosenkavalier," as well as Giacomo Puccini's "La Boh√®me." Seinemeyer also performed in concerts and recitals throughout Europe, receiving critical acclaim for her performances. Sadly, her career was cut short when she died at the young age of 33 from sepsis. Despite her brief career, Seinemeyer remains a celebrated figure in the world of opera and her recordings are still widely admired by fans of the genre to this day.</p><p>Seinemeyer's early talent was recognized by her father, a singer and theater director. She received vocal training from an early age and developed a love for opera. Her breakthrough performance came in 1920 when she sang the role of Marguerite in Charles Gounod's "Faust" at the Berlin State Opera. She was only 25 years old at the time and the audience was mesmerized by her powerful and expressive voice.</p><p>Seinemeyer's success only continued to grow over the next decade. She became a fixture at the Berlin State Opera and also performed at other prestigious venues across Europe. In addition to her performances, she made several recordings that showcased her vocal range and emotional depth.</p><p>Tragically, Seinemeyer's life was cut short by a sudden illness. In 1929, she contracted an infection while on tour and her condition rapidly deteriorated. She died just a few days later, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest sopranos of her time.</p><p>Seinemeyer's impact on the opera world has endured despite her premature death. She was known for her ability to convey raw emotion through her singing, and her performances were praised for their intensity and depth. Her recordings continue to be admired for their beauty and power, and she is remembered as one of the most talented and captivating singers of the early 20th century.</p><p></p><p>
