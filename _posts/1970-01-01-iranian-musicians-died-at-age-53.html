						</p><p>Qazi Muhammad was a Kurdish nationalist leader who became the President of the short-lived Republic of Mahabad in Iranian Kurdistan. He was born into a religious family and received his early education in Islamic studies before pursuing political activities. Qazi Muhammad played a key role in the Kurdish national movement and was known for his advocacy for Kurdish rights and autonomy. He formed the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (KDP-I) and served as its secretary-general. In 1946, Qazi Muhammad led the Kurdish rebellion against the central government in Iran and established the Republic of Mahabad. However, the Iranian army crushed the new state and Qazi Muhammad was captured, tried, and executed for treason in 1947. Despite his short tenure as President of the Republic of Mahabad, Qazi Muhammad is revered by many Kurds as a hero and a symbol of their struggle for autonomy and self-determination.</p><p>Qazi Muhammad's legacy continues to influence Kurdish nationalist movements in Iran and beyond. He is remembered for his commitment to Kurdish rights and his efforts to create a free and independent Kurdistan. In fact, many Kurdish political parties and organizations continue to follow the ideology and principles of the KDP-I that he founded. Additionally, Qazi Muhammad's leadership and role in the movement have been the subject of numerous books and articles, including memoirs written by those who knew him personally. Today, he is celebrated annually in Mahabad with a ceremony commemorating his life and his contributions to the Kurdish people.</p><p></p><p>
