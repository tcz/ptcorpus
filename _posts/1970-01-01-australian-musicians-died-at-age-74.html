(October 14, 1879		Talbingo-September 19, 1954			Drummoyne)


was
an Australian
novelist and writer.


					</p><p>Her best-known work is the novel "My Brilliant Career," which was published in 1901 and tells the story of a young woman named Sybylla Melvyn who dreams of becoming a writer despite the societal pressures placed upon her to marry and have children. </p><p>Franklin left Australia for America and Europe in 1906, and during her time abroad, she worked as a nurse, a governess, and a housemaid, among other jobs. She returned to Australia in 1915 and became involved in political activism, including the women's suffrage movement and campaigns for Indigenous rights. </p><p>Throughout her life, Franklin wrote more than a dozen novels and several non-fiction works, including her autobiographical trilogy "My Career Goes Bung," "Cockatoos," and "Prelude to Waking." In recognition of her contributions to literature and activism, the Miles Franklin Literary Award was established in Australia in 1957, and it is still one of the country's most prestigious literary prizes.</p><p>Franklin was born Stella Maria Sarah Miles Franklin, but later changed her name to Miles Franklin. Her family struggled financially, and she left school at the age of 16 to work as a governess. She began writing at a young age, and her first published work was a poem that she wrote when she was just 12 years old. She continued to write throughout her life and was known for her strong female characters and social commentary. In addition to her writing and activism, Franklin also worked as a literary agent, helping to promote the works of other Australian authors. Franklin never married nor had children, and she lived much of her adult life with her longtime companion, the artist and feminist Anne Isabella "Brent" Paterson.</p><p>Franklin was a trailblazer for women's rights and Indigenous activism. She was passionate about ensuring that women's voices were heard and that they had equal opportunities in society. Her writing often focused on the experiences of women and the struggles they faced in a male-dominated world. She also championed Indigenous rights, and her work was instrumental in bringing attention to the government's mistreatment of Indigenous people in Australia. Her activism did not go unnoticed, and in 1937, she was awarded the King's Medal for Service in the Cause of Australian Literature and the Queen's Coronation Medal in 1953. Today, she is remembered as a pioneering figure in Australian literature and a fierce advocate for social justice.</p><p>In addition to her literary and activism work, Miles Franklin also had a passion for the environment. She was a firm believer in conservation and sustainable practices, and her love for the Australian landscape can be seen in her writing. She even left a bequest in her will for the establishment of the Miles Franklin Nature Reserve, which is located near her childhood home. The reserve was officially opened in 1955, one year after her death, and it stands as a testament to her commitment to preserving Australia's natural beauty.</p><p>Furthermore, Franklin was a strong advocate for education, especially for girls. She believed that education was the key to social progress and that girls should have the same opportunities to learn as boys. Her own lack of formal education motivated her to champion the cause of education, and she supported several initiatives aimed at providing schooling for girls in rural areas.</p><p>Today, Miles Franklin's legacy lives on through the Miles Franklin Literary Award, which has been awarded to many of Australia's most prominent writers, including Patrick White, Tim Winton, and Michelle de Kretser. Her pioneering spirit and commitment to social justice continue to inspire generations of Australians, and her contribution to literature and activism has earned her a permanent place in the country's cultural landscape.</p><p>Despite struggling financially throughout her life, Franklin was a generous philanthropist. She donated money to various causes, including the Australian Red Cross and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. She also established a trust to provide financial assistance to struggling writers. In her later years, she suffered from depression and anxiety, which affected her ability to write. She spent her final years in a nursing home in Sydney, where she died in 1954 at the age of 74. Today, she is remembered as a trailblazing writer and social activist who fought for the rights of women, Indigenous peoples, and the environment. Her legacy continues to inspire Australians to work towards a more just and equitable society.</p><p>In 1957, H. C. "Nugget" Coombs, a former governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, established the Miles Franklin Literary Award in honor of Franklin's contributions to Australian literature. The award recognizes the best novel or play written by an Australian author that portrays Australian life in any of its phases. The first recipient of the award was Patrick White for his novel "Voss." The award has since become one of the most prestigious literary prizes in Australia, and winners have included luminaries such as Peter Carey, David Malouf, and Richard Flanagan.</p><p>Franklin's lasting impact on Australian literature and culture was recognized in 1979, when the Australian government added her portrait to the Australian $10 note. Additionally, in 2008, she was posthumously inducted into the NSW Women's Hall of Fame for her contributions to literature and social justice. Today, she is celebrated as one of Australia's most significant literary figures, and her works continue to be studied and admired both in Australia and around the world.</p><p></p><p>
