							André the Giant was known for his enormous size, standing at over 7 feet tall and weighing over 500 pounds. He began his wrestling career in France and eventually became a worldwide superstar in the sport, competing in promotions such as WWF (now WWE) and NWA. He is perhaps best known for his role in the 1987 film "The Princess Bride," in which he played the character Fezzik. Despite his intimidating size, André was known for his kind personality and was beloved by many who knew him. He suffered from acromegaly, a condition caused by excess growth hormone, which contributed to his enormous size and eventual health issues. He passed away in his sleep at the age of 46 due to heart failure. André the Giant's legacy as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time continues to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=2575" title="Wikipedia article about André the Giant">André the Giant on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/bulgarian-actors-died-at-age-47.html' title='Bulgarian actors died at age 47'><strong>Bulgarian actors died at age 47</strong> List of the top 1 Bulgarian actors who died when they were 47</a></li><li><a href='/egyptian-actors-born-in-1930.html' title='Egyptian actors born in 1930'><strong>Egyptian actors born in 1930</strong> List of the top 6 Egyptian actors who were born in 1930</a></li><li><a href='/german-actors-born-in-1912.html' title='German actors born in 1912'><strong>German actors born in 1912</strong> List of the top 7 German actors who were born in 1912</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actresses-died-in-bowel-obstruction.html' title='American actresses died in Bowel obstruction'><strong>American actresses died in Bowel obstruction</strong> List of the top 2 American actresses who died in Bowel obstruction</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-actors-died-in-2008.html' title='Canadian actors died in 2008'><strong>Canadian actors died in 2008</strong> List of the top 6 Canadian actors who died in 2008</a></li><li><a href='/french-actors-died-at-age-60.html' title='French actors died at age 60'><strong>French actors died at age 60</strong> List of the top 17 French actors who died when they were 60</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
