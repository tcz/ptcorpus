		Anita Bose Pfaff.

						</p><p>Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. He is known for establishing the Indian National Army (INA) with the help of Japan during World War II. Bose was deeply influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda, and he went on to become an ardent nationalist with a deep commitment to freeing India from colonial rule. He was twice elected as the president of the Indian National Congress. During his second term, he resigned from the post and formed the Forward Bloc, a political party that aimed to unite all nationalist forces in India. Bose was determined to use force to overthrow British rule, and he sought the help of the Axis powers during World War II. He made a daring escape from house arrest in Calcutta in 1941 and traveled to Germany to seek support from Adolf Hitler. Bose also visited Japan and was instrumental in organizing the INA, a force comprised of Indian soldiers who fought alongside Japanese troops in Burma and Northeast India. Bose died in a plane crash in Taihoku Prefecture, Taiwan, in 1945, under mysterious circumstances. His death continues to be a topic of debate and speculation.</p><p>Subhas Chandra Bose was born into a wealthy and educated family in Cuttack, Odisha, India. He studied at the University of Calcutta and later went to England to pursue higher education. However, he was expelled from the University of Calcutta and was unable to complete his education in England due to his involvement in nationalist activities.</p><p>Bose was deeply influenced by the non-violent approach of Mahatma Gandhi initially, but later became convinced that India would need to use force to expel the British from its shores. He formed alliances with various groups and leaders around the world in his efforts to free India.</p><p>Despite his controversial methods, Bose is considered a hero by many Indians, and his contributions to the Indian independence movement are widely recognized. The Indian National Army he established helped pave the way for Indian independence from British rule in 1947. Today, he is remembered on his birth anniversary as 'Parakram Diwas' (Day of Valour).</p><p>Subhas Chandra Bose's death has been a topic of controversy, with many theories surrounding it. Some speculate that his plane crash in 1945 was staged, and that Bose actually lived the rest of his life in secret. Others believe that Bose died in the crash, but was killed as part of a larger conspiracy.</p><p>In recent years, there have been calls to declassify files related to Bose's death in order to unravel the truth about his demise. The Indian government formed a committee in 2015 to investigate the mystery surrounding his death, but the findings have yet to be made public.</p><p>Despite the mystery surrounding his death, Subhas Chandra Bose remains a central figure in Indian history and a symbol of bravery and determination in the fight for independence. His legacy continues to inspire future generations of Indian leaders, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in modern Indian history.</p><p>Subhas Chandra Bose's ideologies and political beliefs continue to influence Indian politics to this day. He believed in socialism, secularism, and a strong central government. He envisioned a modern India that was industrialized, proud, and self-reliant. Bose had a charismatic personality and was known for his oratory skills, which helped him gather support and inspire his followers.</p><p>Bose's legacy and contributions to the Indian independence movement have been recognized by various governments and organizations. In 1992, the Indian government declared his birthday, January 23, as "Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Jayanti" to honor his memory. The airport in Kolkata was also renamed in his honor as the "Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport."</p><p>Bose's daughter, Anita Bose Pfaff, has also carried on his legacy and has been active in promoting her father's ideas and principles. She has been a vocal advocate for the declassification of the files related to her father's death and has worked tirelessly to preserve his legacy.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding Bose's death, his contributions to Indian history are undisputed. He remains a national hero and his legacy continues to inspire generations of Indians to fight for their rights and their country's independence.</p><p>Subhas Chandra Bose's death by burn remains a mystery to this day. According to official reports, he died in a plane crash on August 18, 1945, while en route to the Japanese-held island of Taipei. However, there have been several theories that suggest otherwise. Some assert that Bose survived the crash, faked his death, and lived out his life in secrecy. Others believe that he was killed in the crash but that foul play was involved.</p><p>In recent years, there have been renewed efforts to investigate the circumstances surrounding Bose's death. In 2016, a report by the Indian government's Justice Mukherjee Commission concluded that Bose did not die in the plane crash and instead passed away in 1985 in India. However, this theory has been disputed by some.</p><p>Despite the controversy, Subhas Chandra Bose's legacy continues to inspire political leaders and thinkers in India and around the world. His commitment to national liberation and his tireless efforts to secure India's freedom from colonial rule has earned him a place in Indian history as one of the country's greatest patriots.</p><p></p><p>
