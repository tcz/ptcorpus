(August 7, 1901		Munich-June 18, 1966			New York City)


was
a German
journalist.


					</p><p>He is well-known for his critical reporting on the rise of the Nazi party and his attempts to warn the world about the dangers of Hitler's regime. Heiden's book "Der Fuehrer: Hitler's Rise to Power," published in 1944, is considered one of the most important works on the subject. He was forced to flee Germany in 1937 after his life was threatened by the Nazis, and he spent the rest of his life in exile in various countries, including Switzerland and the United States. In addition to his work as a journalist, Heiden was also a historian and political theorist.</p><p>Heiden grew up in a wealthy family in Munich and was educated at the University of Munich. He began his journalistic career as a freelance writer in the 1920s, and was soon hired by the Frankfurter Zeitung, one of Europe's most respected newspapers at the time. He became the paper's correspondent in Berlin in 1927, and it was in this role that he witnessed and reported on the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party.</p><p>Heiden's reporting was initially met with skepticism by many in Germany, as Hitler and his followers worked to control the media and shape public opinion. However, as the Nazi regime grew more oppressive, Heiden's warnings were increasingly heeded by those who opposed Hitler.</p><p>After fleeing Germany, Heiden continued to write and lecture extensively on the dangers of fascism and authoritarianism. He taught at several universities in the United States, including Columbia and UCLA, and was a frequent speaker at events and gatherings devoted to promoting democracy and human rights.</p><p>Despite his contributions to scholarship and journalism, Heiden never quite achieved the level of recognition he deserved during his lifetime. However, his books and articles remain important resources for anyone seeking to understand the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party, and the dangers of authoritarianism and fascism more generally.</p><p>Heiden's work and legacy were also impacted by his personal life. He was openly gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Germany, and his experiences as a gay man in a hostile society shaped his worldview and his approach to political analysis. He also struggled with alcoholism throughout his life, which at times affected his work and relationships.In addition to "Der Fuehrer," Heiden wrote several other books on the Nazi regime and the history of Germany, including "From Democracy to Nazism" and "A History of National Socialism." He was also a contributor to a number of newspapers and magazines in Europe and the United States.Heiden died in New York City in 1966, at the age of 64. Though he never lived to see the full scope of his impact on history, his writings and teachings continue to inspire and inform scholars and activists around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(May 21, 1817		Bautzen-July 1, 1881			Berlin)


was
a German
philosopher.


					</p><p>He was known for his work in developing a concept of reality as a complex of interacting spiritual forces. Lotze studied medicine before turning to philosophy, and his background in science heavily influenced his work. He was a professor at the University of Göttingen from 1848 to 1868, where he served as the chair of philosophy. His most famous work is the three-volume "Microcosmus," in which he outlined his philosophical system. Lotze's ideas had a significant impact on other philosophers of his time, including William James and Josiah Royce.</p><p>One of Lotze's notable contributions is his rejection of materialism and the idea of the universe as a mechanical system, which was widely accepted in the 19th century. Instead, he developed a theory of teleology, which emphasized the purposeful nature of reality. According to Lotze, reality is not predetermined, but rather subject to the influence of different spiritual forces, such as intellect and morality.</p><p>Lotze was also interested in aesthetics and the philosophy of art. He believed that the beauty of art stems from the way it reveals the fundamental spiritual nature of reality. In addition, Lotze made significant contributions to the field of logic, particularly in the areas of formal logic and the theory of propositions.</p><p>In the later years of his life, Lotze shifted his focus to the study of psychology and the philosophy of religion. He was a proponent of the idea that religion is an essential aspect of human nature and that it provides valuable insights into the nature of reality. His later works include "Outlines of the Philosophy of Religion" and "System of Philosophy as a Whole." </p><p>Today, Lotze is considered one of the most important philosophers of the 19th century and a major figure in the development of German idealism. His work continues to be studied and debated by philosophers and scholars around the world.</p><p>Lotze's philosophical system also included a concept of the soul, which he viewed as a spiritual substance that is united with the body. He rejected the notion of the soul as a separate entity that governs the body, but also rejected materialism's view that the soul is a mere product of physical processes. Instead, he emphasized the interaction between the two and viewed the soul as the source of our thoughts and emotions.Lotze was a prolific writer, and his works cover a wide range of topics in philosophy, including metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology. His philosophical approach was highly influential and had a significant impact on the development of philosophical thought in the 20th century. Lotze's ideas also had an impact on other fields, including physics, psychology, and theology. Despite his significant contributions to philosophy, Lotze's work is not widely known outside of academic circles. However, his legacy continues to be felt, and his ideas continue to inspire and challenge scholars and intellectuals around the world.</p><p></p><p>

Today, he is remembered as a pioneering figure in the field of entomology and a key contributor to our understanding of the natural world.</p><p>Herbst's interest in natural history began early in his life. As a child, he collected insects and other specimens and would spend hours studying them.

His financial situation was also precarious, and he struggled to support his growing family on a professor's salary.</p><p>Nevertheless, Herbst's legacy lives on today, and he is remembered as one of the most important naturalists of his time. His meticulous observations and detailed descriptions of insects and crustaceans continue to inspire scientists and scholars around the world, and his contributions have helped shape our understanding of the natural world.</p><p></p><p>

(February 11, 1860		Ziębice-December 22, 1924			Ziębice)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Karl Denke was a notorious serial killer and cannibal who targeted homeless people in the early 20th century. He was known for luring his victims to his home with the promise of work or food, before killing them and dismembering their bodies. Denke was eventually caught when a man discovered human remains in a bag he had purchased from him. Upon searching Denke's home, police found evidence connecting him to multiple murders. Despite his suicide, he was considered mentally fit to stand trial for his crimes. His case sparked widespread fear and outrage, leading some to call for stricter measures to protect the homeless population.</p><p>After Denke's death, shocking discoveries were made in his home. Among the gruesome findings were human skulls, bones, and flesh, some of which were pickled in jars. It is estimated that he had murdered and dismembered as many as 31 people, with many of his victims being homeless men and boys who were looking for work or a place to stay. </p><p>Denke's early life was fairly uneventful. He worked as a weaver and a farm laborer before becoming a woodcutter. However, he was known to be reclusive and had few friends. Neighbors recalled smelling strange odors coming from his home, but they dismissed it as the smell of rotting animal carcasses.</p><p>Today, Karl Denke remains one of the most infamous serial killers in German history. His crimes have been the subject of numerous books, films, and television shows. Some theories suggest that he may have been involved in a wider network of murderers in the region, but these remain unproven.</p><p>Despite his gruesome crimes, little is known about Karl Denke's psychological profile. Some psychologists speculate that Denke's desire to kill and eat his victims may have stemmed from a pathological need for power and control. Others believe that he may have been driven by a deep-seated sense of resentment towards society and the homeless people he targeted. Nonetheless, there is little doubt that Denke was a deeply disturbed individual who caused untold suffering to those who crossed his path.</p><p>In the years since Denke's death, there have been several attempts to understand and explain his actions. Some have pointed to his impoverished childhood and difficult upbringing as possible contributing factors. Others have attributed his crimes to a lack of empathy and a distorted sense of morality.</p><p>Regardless of the root causes of his behavior, Karl Denke remains a chilling reminder of the darkest aspects of human nature. His legacy continues to fascinate criminologists and true crime enthusiasts around the world, and his story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked violence and brutality.</p><p></p><p>

was
a German
film director, screenwriter, actor, writer and film producer.


					
			
		His children
		are
		called
		Thomas Harlan, Maria Körber and Susanne Körber.

						</p><p>Veit Harlan is best known for his controversial Nazi propaganda films, including "Jud Süß" and "Kolberg", which were produced during the Third Reich and served as tools for the Nazi propaganda machine. After World War II, Harlan was tried for war crimes but was eventually acquitted due to lack of evidence. Despite this, his legacy remains tainted by his association with the Nazi regime. After the war, Harlan continued his career in filmmaking and wrote and directed several films. He was married to actress Kristina Söderbaum for many years and worked with her on several films. Harlan's life and work have been the subject of numerous books, documentaries, and debates about the role of art and propaganda in times of war.</p><p>In his early years, Veit Harlan studied acting and directing at the Max Reinhardt School of Drama in Berlin. He made his debut as a film actor in the silent movie "Der fremde Vogel" in 1927, and later appeared in films such as "Faust" and "The Blue Angel". Harlan then transitioned to directing and writing his own films, with his first feature film "Der Durchgänger" released in 1932.</p><p>During the Nazi era, Harlan's films were highly praised by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and he became known as Hitler's favorite director. "Jud Süß", in particular, was seen as a highly antisemitic film and was used to fuel hatred towards Jews in Germany. Despite claims of coercion and pressure from the Nazi regime, Harlan continued to make propaganda films and was accused of being a willing and enthusiastic participant in the Nazi propaganda machine.</p><p>After the war, Harlan was arrested and tried for war crimes in the Nuremberg Trials, but was eventually acquitted due to lack of evidence. His acquittal caused controversy and criticism, with many arguing that he should have been held accountable for his role in promoting Nazi ideology. After the war, Harlan continued to make films, but struggled to regain his status in the film industry. </p><p>Throughout his career, Harlan collaborated frequently with his wife Kristina Söderbaum. However, their working and personal relationship was strained, and Söderbaum later spoke publicly about the difficulties she faced working with Harlan and living under the Nazi regime. </p><p>Today, Harlan's films remain controversial and are rarely screened in public. Nonetheless, his legacy as a filmmaker and propagandist in Nazi Germany continues to fascinate those interested in the intersection of art and politics.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his Nazi propaganda films, Veit Harlan was a talented filmmaker and had a successful career in the German film industry. He directed over 30 films during his lifetime and won several awards, including the National Film Prize in 1958. Some of his post-war films include "Des Teufels General" and "Die Schwarze Galeere".</p><p>Harlan's family also became known for their contributions to the arts. His son Thomas Harlan was a filmmaker and writer who produced several documentaries about the Nazi era, while his daughter Susanne Körber was an actress who appeared in several of her father's films. Harlan's granddaughter, Jan Harlan, also made a career in the film industry as a producer and worked on several iconic films directed by Stanley Kubrick.</p><p>In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Veit Harlan's life and work, with several documentaries and academic studies exploring his legacy and the cultural impact of his propaganda films. While his association with the Nazi regime continues to cast a shadow over his career, it is clear that Harlan was a complex figure whose artistic talents were shaped and distorted by the events of his time.</p><p></p><p>
