(April 23, 1866		Lac-Beauport, Quebec-May 15, 1928			Lac-Beauport, Quebec)


was
a Canadian
entrepreneur and businessperson.


					</p><p>Lannin was best known for his involvement in the sports industry, particularly baseball. He was the owner of the Boston Red Sox from 1914 to 1916, during which time the team won two World Series titles. Lannin was also involved in minor league baseball, owning and managing teams in various cities. </p><p>In addition to his sports ventures, Lannin was a successful businessman in the lumber and paper industries. He owned multiple mills in Canada and the United States. </p><p>Lannin was known for his philanthropy, and donated to various causes throughout his life. He was also involved in politics, serving as Mayor of Lac-Beauport for a time. </p><p>Joseph Lannin passed away in 1928 at the age of 62 in Lac-Beauport, Quebec.</p><p>Lannin's journey to success started as a young boy when he began working at his father's sawmill in Quebec. He eventually moved to the United States and worked in the timber and paper industries in Massachusetts, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In 1914, Lannin purchased the Boston Red Sox for $400,000, a team that had not won a championship in its 12-year existence. Lannin's leadership and financial investments in the team quickly turned the Red Sox into a championship team, with players such as Babe Ruth and Tris Speaker. Despite their success, Lannin sold the team two years later due to conflicts with other team owners. </p><p>Lannin's involvement in minor league baseball began in 1907 when he purchased the Toronto Maple Leafs, and he later owned and managed teams in locations such as Springfield, Massachusetts, and Providence, Rhode Island. He was known for his hands-on management style, often traveling with the team and handling day-to-day operations. </p><p>Apart from his business ventures, Lannin was also involved in various charities, including the Red Cross during World War I, and he provided financial assistance to his hometown of Lac-Beauport. Lannin was also an accomplished equestrian and owned a horse ranch in Massachusetts.</p><p>Today, Lannin's legacy is remembered in the Joseph Lannin Memorial Scholarship Fund in Quebec, which provides financial aid to local students pursuing post-secondary education.</p><p></p><p>

(March 9, 1928		North Bay-March 22, 1990			Brussels)


was
a Canadian
scientist and engineer.


					</p><p>Throughout his career, Bull made significant contributions in the field of ballistics and artillery. He received his PhD in aerodynamics from the University of Toronto and later worked on a number of high-profile projects, including developing artillery for the South African and Iraqi militaries. He was also known for his work on the "supergun," a massive artillery piece capable of firing shells into space. Despite his success in the field, Bull's involvement with controversial weapons projects and his disregard for political sensitivities ultimately led to his assassination in Brussels in 1990.</p><p>After completing his PhD, Bull worked for the Canadian Armament Research and Development Establishment before moving to the United States to work for the Space Research Corporation. While at the SRC, he developed the high-altitude research program which included the Martlet sounding rocket. He went on to found his own company, Space Research Corporation, where he worked on developing long-range artillery for various countries.</p><p>However, Bull's work with Iraq's military led to his downfall. He became involved in developing a supergun for Iraq, a massive artillery piece that could theoretically launch satellites or munitions into space. The project was ultimately abandoned, and Bull was arrested for violating U.S. arms export regulations. Following his release from prison, he continued to work on similar projects in Europe, where he was eventually assassinated in 1990.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in assassination.

In addition, Sifton established a system of direct taxation, introducing both income and land taxes, which helped to fund his reformist agenda.</p><p>Despite his achievements, Sifton faced significant criticism during his premiership, particularly from conservative groups, who opposed his progressive policies. He was also criticized by some labor groups, who felt that his reforms did not go far enough in addressing the needs of workers.</p><p>After leaving politics, Sifton returned to his law practice, where he continued to be a strong advocate for social justice and reform. He was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada shortly before his death in 1921, but unfortunately, he died before he could take up the position.</p><p></p><p>
