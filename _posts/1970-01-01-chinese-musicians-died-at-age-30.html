(February 28, 1119-January 9, 1150)

	
		also known as Wányán Dǎn or Wányán Hélá

	
was
a Chinese
personality.


					</p><p>Emperor Xizong of Jin was the eighth emperor of the Jin Dynasty in China. He ascended the throne at the age of three, following the death of his father. Because of his young age, his mother and grandmother served as regents until he came of age.</p><p>During his reign, he faced numerous challenges, including invasions by neighboring tribes and rebellions by his own officials. Despite this, he managed to stabilize the empire and maintain control over its territories.</p><p>Tragically, Emperor Xizong met an untimely end when he was murdered at the age of 31. The circumstances surrounding his death remain unclear, with some historians suggesting that he was assassinated by his own officials, while others believe that he was killed by members of a rival tribe. Regardless of the cause of his death, Emperor Xizong's legacy as a capable and respected ruler has continued to endure throughout the centuries.</p><p>Emperor Xizong's reign was marked by military conflicts, particularly with the powerful Jurchen tribes, who emerged as a major threat to the Jin Dynasty's northern borders. In 1135, Emperor Xizong personally led an army in a campaign against the Jurchens, which resulted in a significant victory for the Jin Dynasty. However, broader conflicts with the Jurchens continued throughout his reign, and would ultimately contribute to his downfall.</p><p>Emperor Xizong is also credited with promoting culture and education during his reign. He established the Imperial Academy in 1145, which served as a center for learning and scholarship. Under his patronage, many great works of literature and art were produced, contributing to a flourishing cultural scene in the Jin Dynasty.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Emperor Xizong's legacy was marred by the circumstances of his death. The details of his murder remain unclear, but it is believed that his assassination was the result of political intrigue and power struggles within the Jin court. Nevertheless, his reign is remembered as a period of relative stability and prosperity for the Jin Dynasty, and he is considered to be one of its most important rulers.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in homicide.

(January 16, 1975		China-November 17, 2005			China)


was
a Chinese
personality.


					</p><p>Wang Qiang was a notorious criminal who committed multiple murders and robberies. He was considered one of the most ruthless criminals in Chinese history and was sentenced to death for his crimes. Despite his infamous reputation, not much is known about his personal life or background. Wang Qiang's death was a controversial issue in China, with some people arguing that the punishment was too harsh while others supported the decision. Nevertheless, his legacy remains as a cautionary tale for those who choose to follow a life of crime.</p><p>Born on January 16, 1975, in Zunyi, Guizhou, China, Wang Qiang grew up in poverty and struggled to make ends meet. He dropped out of school at a young age and turned to a life of crime to survive. Wang Qiang was known for his violent methods and lack of regard for human life, and by the age of 28, he had committed more than 15 murders and a number of other serious crimes.</p><p>Despite several close encounters with the police, Wang Qiang managed to evade capture for years. He was finally caught in 2004 and sentenced to death the following year. His trial was one of the most high-profile in Chinese history, with many people following the case closely.</p><p>Wang Qiang's case is often cited as an example of the need for criminal justice reform in China. Many argue that the death penalty is disproportionately applied to those who are poor and disadvantaged, and that it does not effectively deter crime. Nevertheless, Wang Qiang's legacy lives on as a reminder of the consequences of a life of crime.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in capital punishment.
