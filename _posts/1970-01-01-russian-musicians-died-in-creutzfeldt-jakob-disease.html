					</p><p>Balanchine is considered one of the most influential choreographers of the 20th century and is known for his neoclassical style of ballet. He began his career as a dancer in the Imperial Russian Ballet before emigrating to the United States in 1933. In America, he co-founded the School of American Ballet and later the New York City Ballet, where he served as the ballet master and principal choreographer for several decades. He created more than 400 works throughout his career, including some of the most iconic and beloved ballets, such as "Serenade," "The Four Temperaments," and "Symphony in C." Balanchine also had a profound influence on modern dance and other art forms beyond ballet. In 1983, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States.</p><p>Throughout his life, Balanchine worked with many famous dancers, including Suzanne Farrell, Maria Tallchief, and Jacques d'Amboise. He was known for his innovative and experimental approach to ballet, often blending classical technique with modern movements and music. He also collaborated with many prominent composers, such as Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev, to create original scores for his ballets. Balanchine's influence on the dance world and popular culture is still felt today, with countless ballet companies performing his works and his style shaping many contemporary dance performances. His legacy continues through the George Balanchine Foundation, a non-profit organization that preserves and promotes his choreography.</p><p>Balanchine grew up in a musical family, with his mother being a pianist and his father a composer. He began studying ballet at a young age and quickly became known for his talent, eventually joining the prestigious Mariinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg. In 1924, he was appointed as choreographer for the Soviet State Opera and Ballet, where he created several innovative works. However, Balanchine clashed with Soviet authorities over artistic freedom, and he eventually left the country in 1924 to tour Europe and the United States.</p><p>After his arrival in the United States, Balanchine began working on Broadway, choreographing musicals and assisting various opera companies. In 1933, he co-founded the School of American Ballet, which became one of the most respected ballet schools in the world. Along with Lincoln Kirstein, Balanchine also founded the New York City Ballet in 1948, which became one of the most influential dance companies of the 20th century.</p><p>Balanchine's choreography was known for its precision, speed, and musicality, and he was renowned for his ability to bring out the best in his dancers. He was also known for his high standards and often pushed his performers to their limits. Balanchine's influence on dance extended beyond the United States, as he traveled around the world to create works and teach master classes.</p><p>Balanchine was married four times and had several relationships with prominent dancers. He remained dedicated to his work until his death in 1983 from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Today, Balanchine is considered one of the greatest choreographers of all time and his legacy continues to inspire generations of dancers and choreographers.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to the dance world, Balanchine was also heavily involved in the film industry. He worked as a choreographer for several Hollywood films, including "On Your Toes" (1939) and "The Goldwyn Follies" (1938). He also collaborated with legendary filmmakers such as Stanley Kubrick on "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968), where he helped create the iconic "Blue Danube" waltz scene.Outside of his work in ballet and film, Balanchine was known for his love of food and wine. He enjoyed cooking and often hosted elaborate dinner parties for his friends and colleagues. Balanchine's love of food also inspired him to create several ballets with culinary themes, including "Vienna Waltzes" and "The Nutcracker," which features a memorable "Land of Sweets" sequence.In recognition of his many contributions to the arts, Balanchine was posthumously awarded a Kennedy Center Honors award in 1983. His influence on the world of dance continues to be celebrated, with several dance companies dedicated to continuing his legacy and choreographers drawing inspiration from his groundbreaking style.</p><p>Balanchine's impact on the dance world was not limited to his pioneering choreography. He also played a crucial role in shaping the training and development of dancers. His philosophy emphasized the importance of a strong technical foundation, with an emphasis on proper posture, alignment, and musicality. He also believed in creating a positive and supportive environment for dancers, enabling them to achieve their full potential.</p><p>Under Balanchine's leadership, the School of American Ballet became a powerhouse for training young dancers, as well as a hub for innovation and experimentation. Balanchine would work closely with his dancers, often adapting his choreography to their specific strengths and abilities. His close collaboration with composer Igor Stravinsky was also critical in ensuring that the music and movement were tightly integrated, creating a cohesive and powerful artistic vision.</p><p>Balanchine was also known for his dedication to the art of ballet itself, rather than individual dancers or star performances. He saw dance as a way of expressing complex ideas and emotions, and his choreography often explored themes such as love, death, and the human condition. His works were also deeply influenced by his own life experiences, including his upbringing in Russia, his immigration to the United States, and his relationships with various lovers and collaborators.</p><p>Today, Balanchine's influence can be seen in countless dance companies and productions around the world. His style continues to inspire, challenge, and delight audiences and dancers alike, and his legacy remains one of the great achievements of 20th century art.</p><p></p><p>
