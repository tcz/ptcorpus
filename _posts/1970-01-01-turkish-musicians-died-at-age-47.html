(April 1, 1937		Yenice, Karataş-September 9, 1984			Paris)

	
		otherwise known as Yılmaz Pütün, Çirkin Kral, Ugly King, Yilmaz Güney, Yilmaz Pütün, Yilmaz Guney or Guney Yilmaz

	
was
a Turkish
film director, actor, screenwriter, film producer and novelist.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Elif Güney and Yılmaz Güney.

						</p><p>He is considered one of Turkey's most influential filmmakers, having directed and acted in over 100 films throughout his career. Güney's films often depicted the struggles of poor and working-class people, shining a light on the social and economic issues facing Turkey at the time. He received numerous awards for his work, both in Turkey and internationally, including the Palme d'Or at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival for his film "Yol". However, Güney's outspoken political beliefs and activism led to his imprisonment and later exile from Turkey. He continued to make films from his base in France until his death in 1984. Today, Güney is remembered not only for his contributions to Turkish cinema but also for his political convictions and dedication to social justice.</p><p>During his lifetime, Yılmaz Güney became a major figure in Turkish and international cinema. Born into a working-class family in Yenice, Karataş, Güney grew up experiencing the poverty and social injustices that would shape his worldview and artistic vision. He dropped out of school at the age of 14 and became a novice miner, but soon discovered his passion for storytelling and began pursuing a career in acting and filmmaking.</p><p>Güney quickly made a name for himself as a talented actor, starring in popular films such as "Dry Summer" (1964) and "Hope" (1970), both of which were directed by Metin Erksan. However, it was as a director and screenwriter that Güney truly made his mark, with films such as "The Herd" (1978) and "The Road" (1982) earning critical acclaim and attracting large audiences in Turkey and beyond.</p><p>Güney's work often dealt with themes of poverty, inequality, and oppression, drawing on his own experiences and the struggles of ordinary people. He was particularly vocal about the plight of Turkey's Kurdish population, and his film "Yol" (1982) was banned in Turkey for its depiction of Kurdish life and customs. Despite this, the film went on to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, solidifying Güney's reputation as a major filmmaker on the international stage.</p><p>In addition to his film work, Güney was also a prolific writer and political activist, advocating for social justice and condemning the Turkish government's treatment of marginalized communities. His activism ultimately led to his imprisonment in 1974, and he spent several years in jail before escaping and fleeing to France. He continued to make films from exile, but his health deteriorated rapidly, and he died of cancer in Paris in 1984.</p><p>Today, Yılmaz Güney is remembered as a pioneering filmmaker and a champion of social justice, a man who used his art to shed light on the struggles of the oppressed and marginalized. His films continue to inspire and provoke audiences around the world, and his legacy lives on as a beacon of hope and resistance in challenging times.</p><p>In addition to his filmmaking and activism, Yılmaz Güney was also a prolific writer, publishing several novels during his lifetime including "The Ugly King," which drew on his experiences growing up in poverty. The novel was later adapted into a film which Güney directed and starred in. Güney was also a talented musician, playing the bağlama, a traditional Turkish stringed instrument, and incorporating music into his films. His contributions to Turkish cinema were recognized in 2014 with the establishment of the Yılmaz Güney Award, which honors filmmakers who promote social justice and human rights through their work. Güney's life and work continue to inspire filmmakers and activists around the world.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Sait Faik or Sait Faik Abasiyanik

	
was
a Turkish
writer, novelist and poet.


					</p><p>He is considered as one of the most prominent figures in the Turkish literature of the 20th century. Sait Faik was born in Adapazarı and spent most of his life in Istanbul where he worked as a civil servant. His literary works create an intense and vivid picture of Turkish life in the mid-20th century, reflecting a deep understanding of the country's traditions, customs and social issues.

However, the family lost their fortune during the First World War and the subsequent Turkish War of Independence. These experiences deeply affected Sait Faik's worldview and contributed to the social and political themes in his writing. He attended a French high school in Istanbul and later studied law at Istanbul University. After graduating, he worked in various government positions, including the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture. Despite his successful career, Sait Faik struggled with alcoholism and experienced several personal tragedies throughout his life.

Sait Faik's influence can be seen in the works of many contemporary Turkish writers, and he is celebrated both in Turkey and abroad.</p><p>Sait Faik was known for his love of cats, and he often included them as characters in his stories. He was also a passionate and skilled sailor, and spent much of his free time on the sea. In fact, he wrote his first short story, "Alemdağ'da Var Bir Yılan" (There is a Snake in Alemdağ), during a sailing trip in the Bosphorus. Sait Faik was deeply influenced by European literature, and translated several works by authors such as Chekhov and Gorky into Turkish. He was also involved in leftist political movements during his youth, and his writing reflects his concern for the issues of class struggle and social inequality. Despite his premature death, Sait Faik's legacy remains strong, and he continues to inspire new generations of writers in Turkey and beyond.</p><p></p><p>

(December 21, 1840		Tekirdağ-December 2, 1888			Chios)


was
a Turkish
journalist.


					
			
		His children
		are
		called
		Feride Kemal, Ulviye Kemal and Ali Ekrem Kemal.

						</p><p>Namık Kemal was also a well-known playwright, novelist, and poet during the late Ottoman period. He was one of the pioneers of the Turkish nationalist movement and is considered to be a founding member of Turkish literature. Namık Kemal played a key role in the establishment of the Ottoman Theatre and was an advocate for the use of the Turkish language in literature and education, as opposed to the traditional use of Arabic and Persian. He spent several years in exile in Europe due to his political beliefs and was known for his fierce criticism of the Ottoman government. He passed away in Chios at the age of 47. Namık Kemal's work continues to be celebrated and studied in Turkey today.</p><p>Namık Kemal was born into a family of government officials and received his education in Istanbul. In 1867, he became the editor of a newspaper called "İbret" and used his platform to voice his opinions about the need for reform in the Ottoman Empire. This led to his exile to Europe, where he spent several years studying and writing plays and novels. </p><p>During his time in Europe, Namık Kemal became friends with other prominent Turkish intellectuals, such as Ziya Pasha and Mustafa Fazıl Pasha. He also attended the Pan-Slavic Congress in Moscow in 1873, where he spoke out against the oppression of minorities in the Ottoman Empire. </p><p>Upon his return to Turkey in 1877, Namık Kemal continued to advocate for reform and greater rights for Turkish citizens. He wrote plays that addressed social issues, such as women's rights, and encouraged the use of the Turkish language in education and literature. </p><p>Namık Kemal's legacy continues to be felt in Turkey today, where he is considered one of the nation's most important literary figures. His work helped pave the way for Turkey's transition to a more secular and Western-oriented society in the twentieth century.</p><p>Namık Kemal's most notable plays include "Vatan Yahut Silistre" (Fatherland or Silistra), which tells the story of a group of soldiers fighting to defend their country against foreign invasion, and "İntibah" (Awakening), which explores the tensions between traditional Ottoman society and the growing influence of western culture. In his poetry, Namık Kemal often used nature and the beauty of the Turkish landscape to express his love for his country and his nationalist beliefs. His novel, "Cezmi," is considered one of the earliest examples of the Turkish novel and is based on the historical figure Cezmi, a famous Ottoman wrestler. Namık Kemal's contribution to Turkish literature was so significant that he was honored with a commemorative postage stamp in 1940. Today, his plays are still staged and his poetry is taught in schools across Turkey.</p><p></p><p>
