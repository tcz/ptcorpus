					</p><p>He was a poet and the author of "Odes on Several Descriptive and Allegoric Subjects" as well as other poems. Collins grew up in Chichester and attended Oxford University. His poetry was often melancholic with themes of lost love and the passing of time. Despite his talent, Collins struggled throughout his life with mental illness and financial difficulties.
