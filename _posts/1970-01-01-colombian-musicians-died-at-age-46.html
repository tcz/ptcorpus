He studied at the Universidad Del Norte, where he developed a passion for literature and journalism. In the 1950s, he became one of the most important writers of the Barranquilla Group, a literary movement that aimed to break away from the traditional academic style and explore new ways of writing, using the so-called "magic realism" elements.</p><p>Apart from La Casa Grande, which has been translated into several languages and is considered a key work of Colombian literature, Cepeda published two more novels, Perder es cuestión de método (1956) and Pájaro de ojos amarillos (1960). The latter was awarded the Biblioteca Breve prize, a prestigious literary award in Spain.</p><p>Cepeda's journalism work was characterized by his incisive and critical writing style, which often addressed social and political issues of his time. He was also an important translator, bringing to the Colombian public works by authors such as Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, and Jean-Paul Sartre.</p><p>Cepeda's premature death at the age of 46 occurred due to a heart attack while he was travelling in Europe. He left a legacy as one of the most important writers and intellectuals of 20th century Colombia.</p><p>Cepeda's impact on Colombian literature and the Latin American literary scene was significant, with his work being praised for its exploration of Colombian and Latin American identity, politics, and culture.

La Casa Grande remains a seminal work of Latin American literature, and his contributions to Colombian journalism and translation also continue to be recognized.</p><p>Cepeda's legacy has been recognized through various forms of tribute, including the Álvaro Cepeda Samudio National Short Story Award, which was established in 2016 in honor of his literary work. The award aims to promote the development of short story writing in Colombia and to encourage emerging writers.

He was also a prolific writer of short stories, some of which are considered among the best examples of the genre in Latin American literature. Cepeda's literary contributions and political activism earned him a reputation as a cultural icon in Colombia, and he remains an important figure in the country's literary and intellectual history.
