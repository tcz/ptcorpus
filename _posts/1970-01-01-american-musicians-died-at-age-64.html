(August 27, 1908		Stonewall-January 22, 1973			Stonewall)

	
		also known as President Lyndon B. Johnson, Lyndon Johnson, LBJ, Lyndon Baines Johnson, Lyndon B Johnson, Johnson, Lyndon B., Lindon B. Johnson, President Lyndon Johnson, Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, L.B.J., Landslide Lyndon or Johnson, Light Bulb

	
was
an American
teacher and politician.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Lynda Bird Johnson Robb and Luci Baines Johnson.

						</p><p>Lyndon B. Johnson was the 36th President of the United States and served from 1963 to 1969. Prior to his presidency, he was the Vice President under John F. Kennedy. During his presidency, Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discrimination based on race and ethnicity. He also passed Medicare and Medicaid, which provided healthcare to millions of Americans. Johnson's presidency was also marked by the escalation of the Vietnam War, which drew criticism and protests from the American public. Johnson decided not to seek re-election in 1968 and retired to his ranch in Texas. Johnson is widely regarded as one of the most effective legislators in American history.</p><p>Despite being remembered for his domestic achievements, Johnson's presidency was largely defined by his foreign policy decisions concerning the Vietnam War. He escalated the US military presence in Vietnam, sending hundreds of thousands of troops to fight against communist forces, which ultimately resulted in the loss of thousands of American lives. Johnson's handling of the war led to widespread anti-war protests and criticism, causing his approval ratings to plummet. In 1968, he shocked the nation by announcing he would not seek a second term as president. After leaving the White House, Johnson returned to Texas and remained active in politics, continuing to promote his vision of a Great Society that would benefit all Americans. Today, his legacy is remembered both for his critical role in advancing civil rights, healthcare, and education, as well as for his controversial policies during the Vietnam War.</p><p>Lyndon B. Johnson was born in Stonewall, Texas, and grew up in a small farmhouse without electricity or indoor plumbing. He graduated from Southwest Texas State Teachers College (now Texas State University) and taught school in Cotulla, Texas, before embarking on a political career. Johnson was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937 and served six terms before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1948. As a senator, he was known for his efforts to improve living conditions in rural America and expand the nation's infrastructure.</p><p>In 1960, Johnson ran for the Democratic presidential nomination but lost to John F. Kennedy, who went on to win the presidency. Kennedy then chose Johnson as his running mate, and Johnson was inaugurated as vice president on January 20, 1961. On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, and Johnson was sworn in as president aboard Air Force One later that day.</p><p>As president, Johnson declared a "war on poverty" and launched a series of domestic programs known as the Great Society. He also signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished national origin quotas and opened up legal immigration to millions of people from Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p><p>However, Johnson's presidency was also defined by the Vietnam War, which escalated under his leadership. Johnson used the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1964 to justify the beginning of American military involvement in Vietnam. He sent hundreds of thousands of troops to Vietnam and escalated bombing of North Vietnam, which ultimately led to widespread protests and criticism. Johnson's decision not to seek re-election in 1968 was largely attributed to the unpopularity of the war.</p><p>Johnson died of a heart attack on January 22, 1973, at his ranch in Texas, just four days after the Vietnam peace agreement was signed. He was remembered as a complex figure who achieved significant domestic accomplishments but also faced criticism for his handling of the Vietnam War.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of myocardial infarction.

(November 23, 1804		Hillsborough-October 8, 1869			Concord)


was
an American
lawyer and politician.


					
			
		He had
		three
		children,
		Benjamin Pierce, Franklin Pierce, Jr. and Franklin Robert Pierce.

						</p><p>Pierce served as the 14th President of the United States from 1853-1857. He was a member of the Democratic Party and served in several political offices including the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. During his presidency, he pursued expansionist policies such as the Gadsden Purchase and the Ostend Manifesto. However, his handling of the escalating tensions between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions further divided the nation and contributed to the outbreak of the Civil War. Despite his efforts to bring unity, Pierce was widely criticized for his lack of leadership skills and was not nominated for re-election.</p><p>Franklin Pierce was born in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, to a prominent family, and grew up in relative privilege. He attended Bowdoin College in Maine, where he made friends with author Nathaniel Hawthorne, who would write a campaign biography for Pierce years later. Pierce served in the Mexican-American War, where he was promoted to brigadier general, and it was during this time that his views on expansionism became more pronounced. After serving in the Senate and the House, Pierce won the Democratic nomination for president in 1852, largely due to his status as a compromise candidate. During his presidency, Pierce refused to take a stance on issues such as the controversial Kansas-Nebraska Act and the growing tensions between North and South over slavery, which further damaged his popularity. After his presidency, Pierce became increasingly depressed, especially after the death of his son in a train accident, and turned to alcohol for comfort, which is believed to have contributed to his death from cirrhosis.</p><p>Despite his controversial presidency, Pierce was known for his strong sense of duty and loyalty, as well as his charm and charisma. He was also a skilled orator and was able to connect with people from all walks of life. Despite his lack of success as president, Pierce was well-respected as a lawyer and continued to practice law in his later years. He also remained active in politics and was a vocal critic of Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. Today, Pierce is often considered one of the least successful presidents in U.S. history, but his presidency remains an important chapter in the story of the United States' path toward civil war.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in cirrhosis.

						</p><p>William Faulkner is considered one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century. He is known for his experimental writing style and use of stream-of-consciousness narrative. Faulkner wrote numerous iconic novels such as "The Sound and the Fury," "As I Lay Dying," "Light in August," and "Absalom, Absalom!" His works often explore themes of race, class, and the decline of the American South. Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949 for his contribution to the literary world. In addition to his writing, Faulkner also served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War I and was a Hollywood screenwriter in the 1930s and 1940s.</p><p>Faulkner grew up in Mississippi and spent most of his life in the state. He attended the University of Mississippi but left before graduating to pursue a writing career. Despite little initial success, he continued to write and eventually gained critical acclaim. Faulkner's work has had a lasting impact on American literature and has been the subject of much study and analysis. He was known for his often complex and nonlinear storytelling, as well as his creation of the fictional Yoknapatawpha County, which served as the setting for many of his works. Faulkner's personal life was also marked by struggles, including alcoholism and financial difficulties. Despite these challenges, he continued to write and left behind a legacy that continues to inspire readers and writers alike.</p><p>Faulkner's writing style was heavily influenced by his Southern upbringing and his experiences in the post-Civil War South. He often addressed the legacy of slavery and racism in his works and was known for his complex and nuanced portrayal of Black characters, which was rare for writers of his time. Faulkner was also known for his use of multiple perspectives and non-linear storytelling, which was a departure from the more traditional narrative style of his contemporaries.</p><p>Faulkner was married to his wife Estelle Oldham for more than 30 years, though their relationship was tumultuous at times. Faulkner had a close relationship with his daughter Jill, who he often called his "little pal." In addition to his writing career, Faulkner was also a farmer and owned a small bookstore in Oxford, Mississippi.</p><p>Faulkner's impact on American literature cannot be overstated. His works continue to be studied and celebrated today and have influenced countless writers, both in the United States and around the world. Faulkner's legacy as one of the most important writers of the 20th century is secure, and his works remain a testament to the power of literature to explore the complexities of the human experience.</p><p></p><p>
