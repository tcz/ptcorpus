Fritsch also worked extensively with experimental and live electronic music, and collaborated with artists in other fields such as dance, theatre and film. He passed away in Bonn at the age of 68.</p><p>Fritsch's compositions varied widely in style and technique, ranging from traditional classical music to avant-garde and experimental soundscapes. He was known for his innovative use of electronic music and often incorporated live electronics into his performances. Fritsch was also a prolific writer on the subject of music, publishing numerous articles and essays on composition, electronic music, and improvisation.

In 2002, Fritsch was awarded the German Music Publishers Society's Golden Medal of Merit for his contributions to contemporary music. His legacy continues to inspire and influence the next generation of composers and musicians.</p><p>One of Fritsch's most notable compositions is his piece "Schleusen", which is a three-part work for violin, cello and piano. It's known for its complex and intricate interplay between the three instruments, as well as for its use of extended techniques such as harmonics and glissandos. Another significant work is his "Eleven Instrumental Verses", which is a collection of short pieces that explore the sonic possibilities of different instrument combinations.

His music continues to be performed and recorded by ensembles around the world, and his impact on the field of contemporary music remains significant.</p><p>Fritsch's interest in spatial music stemmed from his fascination with the way sound interacts with physical space and how it can create a unique sensory experience for the listener. He created several groundbreaking pieces that experimented with spatial sound, including his works for the Feedback Studio and the Electronic Studio, as well as pieces for large ensembles and orchestra. Fritsch also collaborated with architect Peter Zumthor on a number of projects that explored the relationship between sound and architecture, such as the "Bruder Klaus Field Chapel", a modernist chapel in Switzerland that incorporates Fritsch's spatial music into the design.</p><p>Fritsch's legacy continues to influence contemporary music and experimental sound art, both in Germany and worldwide. He is remembered as a composer who pushed the boundaries of traditional music and sound art and explored the possibilities of electronic and live music.
