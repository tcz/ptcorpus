						Manuel was best known as a member of the rock band, The Band, which he co-founded along with Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, Rick Danko, and Garth Hudson in 1968. He contributed his soulful voice and intricate piano playing to some of the band's greatest hits, including "The Weight", "Chest Fever", and "I Shall Be Released". Manuel's struggles with substance abuse eventually led to the Band's dissolution in 1976, after which he continued to perform as a solo artist and with other musicians. He tragically committed suicide in 1986 at the age of 42. Despite his shortened career, Manuel's impact on music has been significant, and his songs and collaborations with The Band continue to be celebrated by music fans worldwide.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=664492" title="Wikipedia article about Richard Manuel">Richard Manuel on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/hungarian-musicians-born-in-1976.html' title='Hungarian musicians born in 1976'><strong>Hungarian musicians born in 1976</strong> List of the top 7 Hungarian  music stars who died in who were born in 1976</a></li><li><a href='/english-musicians-died-at-age-42.html' title='English musicians died at age 42'><strong>English musicians died at age 42</strong> List of the top 6 English music stars who died when they were 42</a></li><li><a href='/british-musicians-died-at-age-63.html' title='British musicians died at age 63'><strong>British musicians died at age 63</strong> List of the top 17 British music stars who died when they were 63</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/belarusian-musicians-died-at-age-39.html' title='Belarusian musicians died at age 39'><strong>Belarusian musicians died at age 39</strong> List of the top 1 Belarusian music stars who died when they were 39</a></li><li><a href='/iranian-actresses-died-in-brain-tumor.html' title='Iranian actresses died in Brain tumor'><strong>Iranian actresses died in Brain tumor</strong> List of the top 1 Iranian actresses who died in Brain tumor</a></li><li><a href='/german-actresses-died-at-age-64.html' title='German actresses died at age 64'><strong>German actresses died at age 64</strong> List of the top 3 German actresses who died when they were 64</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
