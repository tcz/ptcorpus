						</p><p>Niall of the Nine Hostages is believed to have lived during the 4th or 5th century, and was the founder of the powerful Uí Néill dynasty in Ireland. He earned his nickname "of the Nine Hostages" because of his habit of taking hostages from rival Irish kingdoms in order to maintain power and control over his region. </p><p>Legend has it that Niall also ventured overseas to establish himself as a powerful warrior and leader. He is said to have raided the coastlines of Scotland, England, and France, and even took St. Patrick (who later became the patron saint of Ireland) as a hostage for a time.</p><p>Despite his violent conquests, Niall is also remembered for facilitating the spread of Christianity throughout Ireland, allowing for the creation of a united Irish identity that has persisted to this day.

According to one myth, when he was born, a wise druid predicted that he would go on to become a great king, but that he would also bring destruction to many people.

His descendants continue to hold a place of prominence in Irish society, and many Irish people today claim to be descended from Niall of the Nine Hostages.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 2015		Ballygar-April 5, 2015)


was
an Irish
personality.


					</p><p>While it may seem strange that Mattie McDonagh only lived for one day, his life and death have a significant impact on Irish society. McDonagh was one of the "Tuam babies," a group of nearly 800 infants who died at a Catholic institution in Tuam, Ireland between 1925 and 1961. These babies were often the children of unwed mothers who were ostracized from society and forced to give birth in secret. The babies were then taken from their mothers and sent to these institutions, where many of them died from neglect and malnutrition. McDonagh's short life symbolizes the tragedy of these "Tuam babies" and the need to acknowledge and remember their existence. In 2019, a significant step towards recognition and justice was made when a mass grave containing the bodies of 796 infants was discovered in Tuam. The discovery sparked renewed public interest and debate about the treatment of unwed mothers and their babies in 20th-century Ireland.</p><p>Despite his short life, Mattie McDonagh and the other "Tuam babies" have left a lasting impact on Ireland's cultural and social history. The discovery of the mass grave brought attention to the cruel treatment of these mothers and their children, and sparked calls for justice and reconciliation. This event has shed light on the systemic oppression of women and children in Ireland's past, and has sparked a national conversation about how to move forward and heal from this dark history.</p><p>Today, memorials have been erected in honor of the "Tuam babies," and efforts are being made to identify and bury their remains properly. Mattie McDonagh's life may have been brief, but his legacy will continue to shape Irish society for years to come as a symbol of the country's ongoing struggle for social justice and human rights.</p><p></p><p>

Mac Murrough allied with the Normans, who he invited into Ireland to help him regain his position as King of Leinster.</p><p>Despite his initial success in securing his own position, Mac Murrough ultimately failed to maintain his power and died in obscurity. However, his legacy lives on in the form of the Norman influence he helped introduce to Ireland, which would shape Irish history for centuries to come.</p><p>Mac Murrough was also known for his controversial reputation, particularly for the abduction of Dervorgilla, wife of Tiernan O'Rourke, which led to an ongoing feud between the two Irish leaders. This event also contributed to the invitation to the Normans, who were seen as a means of gaining an advantage in the conflict. </p><p>Mac Murrough's alliance with the Normans had far-reaching consequences for the country. The invasion that he initiated caused significant changes in the political landscape of Ireland, with Norman feudal lords being granted land and influence over much of the island. The consequences of this would remain a point of contention in Irish history for centuries.</p><p>Despite his actions, Mac Murrough is remembered as a complex figure, with historians and authors continuing to debate his character and legacy. Many in Ireland still see him as a symbol of the country's complicated relationship with foreign influences and its medieval past.</p><p></p><p>
