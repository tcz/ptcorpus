							</p><p>Born to a wealthy family, Roger Wolfe Kahn started playing the piano at a young age and was trained by several renowned tutors. His father, Otto Kahn, was a prominent banker and philanthropist, who was a patron of the arts. Roger initially pursued a career in law but gave it up to pursue his love for music. He formed his first band, the Roger Wolfe Kahn Orchestra, in the late 1920s and became immensely popular in the New York City music scene. </p><p>Kahn was known for incorporating both jazz and classical elements into his music, and his band was credited with popularizing the foxtrot dance. His band's most popular hit was "Crazy Rhythm" which was released in 1928. The song became an instant classic and was covered numerous times by other musicians. </p><p>Kahn's career as a bandleader was cut short due to the Great Depression, which caused many orchestras to disband. He then turned to composing music for films and worked on the score for a number of Hollywood movies. Eventually, Kahn returned to New York and formed another orchestra, but this time, his popularity was not as high as it used to be. </p><p>Kahn continued to play music until his death from a heart attack in 1962. His legacy as one of the pioneering figures of early jazz and swing music endures to this day.</p><p>Throughout his career, Roger Wolfe Kahn composed and arranged music for a variety of other artists and bands, including Benny Goodman and Fletcher Henderson. He also worked on several Broadway productions, including "The Band Wagon" and "Flying Colors". On top of his significant contributions to the music world, Kahn was also an advocate for animal rights and even owned a pet lion named Cubs. In his later years, he became increasingly involved in the civil rights movement and was an avid supporter of Martin Luther King Jr. and his causes. Today, Kahn is remembered as a talented musician and composer who left an indelible mark on the development of modern jazz and popular music.</p><p>In addition to his musical pursuits and advocacy work, Roger Wolfe Kahn had a reputation as a playboy and socialite. He was known for throwing lavish parties and dating high-profile actresses and socialites, including Gloria Vanderbilt and Barbara Hutton. He also had a love for aviation and was a licensed pilot, frequently flying his own plane to performances and events. Despite his wealth and success, Kahn faced personal struggles with addiction and mental health issues throughout his life. In the years following his death, his music has experienced a resurgence in popularity, with new generations discovering and appreciating his contributions to early jazz and swing music.</p><p>In 2010, a collection of 13 rare recordings by Roger Wolfe Kahn and his orchestra were rediscovered and released on CD. The recordings were thought to have been lost for decades and showcased the band's unique combination of classical and jazz music. Numerous jazz historians have praised Kahn's skills as a pianist and bandleader, with some even hailing him as one of the most innovative and talented musicians of his time. Despite facing numerous setbacks and obstacles throughout his career, Kahn remained dedicated to his passion for music and continued to push the boundaries of what was possible in jazz and swing music. Today, his contributions to the genre are recognized as instrumental in shaping the sound of modern popular music.</p><p></p><p>

(February 21, 1907		York-September 29, 1973			Vienna)

	
		otherwise known as W.H. Auden, Wystan Hugh Auden or Auden, W.H.

	
was
an American
librettist, poet, screenwriter, author, composer, writer, playwright and essayist.


						</p><p>He was born in York, England and later became an American citizen in 1946. Auden is regarded as one of the greatest poets of the 20th century and his works were known for their technical virtuosity and depth of engagement with politics, social issues and psychology. He initially gained fame with his 1930 collection of poems titled "Poems", followed by several other collections including "The Orators" and "The Double Man". </p><p>Auden's poems often deal with universal themes such as love, death, and the quest for meaning in a chaotic world. He was also known for his collaborations with other artists, including composer Benjamin Britten and playwright Christopher Isherwood. Auden was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1948 and his poems continue to be studied and celebrated by scholars and readers around the world.</p><p>In addition to his poetry, W. H. Auden also wrote several essays and critical works, including "The Enchafèd Flood" and "The Dyer's Hand". He was known for his witty and insightful commentary on literature and culture. Auden also worked as a screenwriter and wrote several plays, including "The Dance of Death" and "The Dog Beneath the Skin". He moved to the United States in 1939 and taught at various universities, including the University of Michigan and the University of Oxford. Auden was also an active member of the political left and advocated for social change throughout his career. He died of a heart attack while on vacation in Vienna in 1973, leaving behind a rich legacy of works that continue to inspire and influence generations of writers and artists.</p><p>During his time in America, W. H. Auden became a prominent figure in literary circles and a spokesperson for the liberal political movement. He was known for his leftist political views and his strong opposition to fascism and totalitarianism. Auden's experiences during the Spanish Civil War and World War II heavily influenced his work, and many of his poems of this period reflect his belief that poetry must be politically engaged. </p><p>Auden was openly gay and his sexuality is a recurring theme in his works. He had several romantic relationships throughout his life, including a long-term partnership with American poet Chester Kallman. Auden's poems often explore themes of love and same-sex desire, and he was a pioneer of queer literature in the mid-20th century. </p><p>In addition to his Pulitzer Prize, W. H. Auden received numerous awards and honors throughout his lifetime, including the National Book Award, the Bollingen Prize, and the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry. He remains one of the most influential and widely read poets of the modern era, and his works continue to inspire new generations of readers and writers.</p><p>Auden was also known for his interest in psychology and his exploration of the human psyche in his poetry. He was particularly influenced by the work of Sigmund Freud, and his poems often deal with themes of anxiety, guilt, and the unconscious mind. Auden's interest in psychology is evident in his most famous poem, "September 1, 1939", which explores the psychological impact of the outbreak of World War II.</p><p>Throughout his career, Auden was deeply engaged with the world around him and was known for his social and political activism. He was a strong advocate for civil rights, nuclear disarmament, and the rights of refugees and migrants. Auden was also a keen observer of popular culture and was known for his satirical commentary on consumerism, mass media, and the commodification of art.</p><p>Despite his success, Auden was known for his self-deprecating sense of humor and his rejection of the idea of the "great poet". He often referred to himself as a "minor poet" and was critical of the cult of personality that surrounded many of his contemporaries. Today, Auden's poetry continues to be widely read and celebrated for its technical mastery, intellectual depth, and engagement with the major social and political issues of his time.</p><p></p><p>

(November 26, 1907		Sumner-September 1, 1941)


was
an American
, .


						</p><p>Frank Melrose was an American jazz and blues pianist, guitarist, and composer. He was known for his distinctive style which combined elements of ragtime, blues, and boogie-woogie. Melrose began playing piano at a young age and quickly gained a reputation as a talented musician. He performed with many of the top jazz and blues musicians of his time and recorded numerous solo and group sessions. Melrose was also a prolific songwriter, composing many popular tunes such as "Messin' Around" and "Chicago Stomp". Despite his success, he struggled with alcoholism and financial troubles for much of his career. Melrose tragically died by suicide at the age of 33. He left behind a legacy as an influential musician whose style paved the way for many future jazz and blues artists.</p><p>Melrose was born in Sumner, Illinois, but grew up in Chicago where he first began to hone his musical skills. He was self-taught and began playing in clubs and speakeasies in the city's South Side during the 1920s. He played often with other notable musicians such as Big Bill Broonzy and Blind Blake. In 1929, he recorded with Tampa Red and Georgia Tom for Vocalion Records, where he played piano and guitar on some of the label's most notable blues recordings.</p><p>In addition to his work as a musician, Melrose was also a talented artist and created many of his own album designs and advertising posters. He was also known for his wild antics on stage, often incorporating comedy and theatrics into his performances.</p><p>Despite his short career, Melrose's influence can be heard in the music of many later jazz and blues artists. His innovative use of syncopation and improvisation helped pave the way for the development of jazz and blues piano styles in the decades to come.</p><p>Melrose's legacy also extends beyond his music. He was one of the few white musicians to fully immerse himself in the African-American music scene during a time of racial segregation. He gained respect and admiration from his black peers and was welcomed into their community, which was a rare occurrence at the time.</p><p>Melrose's life was surrounded by tragedy and hardship, from his struggles with alcoholism and financial instability to the untimely end of his life. However, his influence on jazz and blues music cannot be denied. His unique style and musical innovations continue to inspire musicians and listeners alike to this day.</p><p>Melrose's music was especially popular in Europe, where he toured extensively during the 1930s. He performed in England, France, and Germany, among other countries, and was received with great acclaim by audiences and critics alike. During his European tours, Melrose recorded several sessions for the British Decca label, including some of his most famous tunes such as "Bluesiana" and "Rhythm Room Blues". Melrose's popularity in Europe helped to popularize jazz and blues music outside of the United States, contributing to their global spread and influence.</p><p>Despite his success in Europe, Melrose's career in the United States was hampered by the Great Depression and the decline of the recording industry. He continued to perform in clubs and theaters throughout the country, but struggled to make a living and support his family. Melrose's personal life was also marked by tragedy, including the death of his infant daughter and the dissolution of his marriage.</p><p>Melrose's final years were plagued by worsening alcoholism and financial difficulties. He attempted to revive his career with a new record label and a series of solo piano recordings, but these efforts proved unsuccessful. On September 1, 1941, Melrose died by suicide in Chicago. He was buried in an unmarked grave until 1997, when a group of musicians and fans raised funds to purchase a headstone for his resting place.</p><p>Today, Melrose is remembered as a pioneering figure in jazz and blues music, whose innovative style and contributions helped to shape the course of American music in the 20th century. His influence can be heard in the work of countless musicians across generations and genres, cementing his legacy as one of the most important figures in American musical history.</p><p></p><p>
