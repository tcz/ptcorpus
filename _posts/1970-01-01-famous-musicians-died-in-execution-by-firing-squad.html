(October 7, 1879		Gävle-November 19, 1915			Utah)


was
an American
songwriter.


					</p><p>He was born in Sweden as Joel Emmanuel Hägglund and immigrated to the United States in 1902. Hill was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, also known as the "Wobblies," and used his music to spread socialist and labor union messages. He is best known for songs like "The Preacher and the Slave" and "There is Power in a Union." Hill was also an active organizer and participated in strikes, which led to his arrest and eventual execution by firing squad for a murder he may not have committed. Hill continues to be a symbol of labor activism and protest in American history.</p><p>Before becoming a labor activist, Joe Hill worked at a variety of jobs including as a miner, dockworker, and lumberjack. His experiences in these jobs helped shape his views on the importance of worker solidarity and rights. He often traveled the country, using his music to support striking workers and raise awareness about labor issues. </p><p>Hill's trial and execution are still controversial today, and many believe he was wrongfully convicted due to his labor activism and socialist beliefs. His famous quote, "Don't mourn, organize!" has become a rallying cry for labor movements and political activists worldwide. His songs continue to inspire musicians and activists to this day, and his legacy has been celebrated in films, books, and plays. Hill's life and legacy are a testament to the power of music as a tool for social change.</p><p></p><p>

(May 24, 1893		Tbilisi-October 27, 1938			Baku)

	
		a.k.a. Khadija Osman bey qizi Gayibova or Khadija Muftizadeh

	
was
an Azerbaijani
pianist and teacher.


					</p><p>Khadija Gayibova was born into a family of musicians and developed her passion for music at a young age. She studied at the Tbilisi Conservatoire and later at the Moscow Conservatory, where she studied under some of the most renowned pianists of her time. After completing her studies, she returned to Azerbaijan and began teaching at the Baku Conservatory.</p><p>Aside from her teaching career, Gayibova was also a celebrated pianist and gave numerous concerts both in Azerbaijan and abroad. Her playing was characterized by a unique style that combined elements of Azerbaijani traditional music with Western classical music. In addition to her solo career, she also played in a duo with the violinist Zaki Mammadov.</p><p>Despite her success as a musician and teacher, Gayibova fell victim to the purges of the Stalinist regime and was arrested in 1937 on false charges of espionage. She was sentenced to death and executed in 1938. However, her legacy as a pioneering Azerbaijani pianist and teacher lives on, and she is still remembered as one of the most talented and influential musicians of her time.</p><p>Gayibova's contributions to Azerbaijani music also extend beyond her career as a pianist and a teacher. She was one of the founders of the Azerbaijan State Symphony Orchestra and served as its first deputy artistic director. She also played an important role in the development of Azerbaijani ballet, working closely with the composer Gara Garayev to create the country's first ballet, "Leyli and Majnun." </p><p>Gayibova's legacy was largely silenced during the Soviet era, but she was posthumously rehabilitated in 1955, with the authorities acknowledging the wrongful nature of her arrest and execution. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Gayibova's life and work, with concerts and performances dedicated to her memory. In 2018, the Azerbaijan State Symphony Orchestra performed a concert in honor of Gayibova, featuring her own compositions alongside works by her contemporaries.</p><p></p><p>
