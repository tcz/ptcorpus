					</p><p>He rose to fame as a member of the influential 1980s rock band, Loverboy, and played on many of the band's biggest hits, including "Working for the Weekend" and "Turn Me Loose." Smith also played bass for other famous bands such as Bryan Adams, Sheriffs, and the Payolas. He left Loverboy to pursue a solo career in 1988 and released his only album, "12", which was commercially unsuccessful. In 2000, Smith unfortunately passed away in a drowning accident while on vacation in California. His contributions to the music industry have been widely recognized, and he is remembered as a talented and respected musician.</p><p>Smith was born and raised in Winnipeg, Canada, and began playing bass in his teenage years. He moved to Vancouver in the late 1970s and became a sought-after session musician, playing on numerous albums by Canadian artists. His work with Loverboy propelled him to international stardom, and he toured extensively with the band throughout the 1980s. Despite his success, Smith was known for his humble and down-to-earth personality.</p><p>In addition to his music career, Smith was also an avid outdoorsman and environmentalist.

In his later years, he split his time between touring and spending time at his cabin in northern British Columbia.</p><p>Since his passing, Smith has been posthumously inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the British Columbia Entertainment Hall of Fame. His legacy continues to influence musicians around the world, and he is remembered as a kind and talented individual who left a lasting impact on the music industry.</p><p>Smith's influence on the music industry can be seen in the way he approached playing the bass. He was known for his unique style, which combined melodic playing with driving rhythms. His innovative approach to the bass was particularly notable in his work with Loverboy, where he added a distinctive edge to the band's sound. Smith's work with the band helped to define the arena rock sound of the 1980s, and his influence can still be heard in the music of many contemporary rock bands.</p><p>Despite his success with Loverboy and other bands, Smith remained dedicated to his craft and continued to work on new music throughout his life. He was known for his perfectionism in the studio and was constantly seeking to improve his playing and songwriting abilities.</p><p>Smith's tragic passing in 2000 was a shock to the music world and left many fans and fellow musicians reeling. In the wake of his death, there was an outpouring of tributes from his peers, who praised him for his talent, kindness, and dedication to the music he loved.</p><p>In addition to his induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the British Columbia Entertainment Hall of Fame, Smith's legacy continues to be celebrated through an annual music festival in his honor. The Scott Smith Scholarship Fund, which supports aspiring musicians, was also established in his memory.</p><p></p><p>
