									</h1><p>Here are 13 famous musicians from Italy died at 65:</p><h2>Marsilio Ficino</h2><p><strong>Marsilio Ficino</strong>
(October 19, 1433		Figline Valdarno-October 1, 1499			Villa Medici at Careggi)


was
an Italian
astrologer and philosopher.


					</p><p>He was a leading scholar of the Florentine Renaissance who revived and popularized Platonism. Ficino's translations of Plato's works into Latin and his commentaries on them helped spread knowledge of Neoplatonism throughout Europe. He was also a key figure in the development of humanism, which emphasized the value of human beings and their achievements. Ficino was a member of the influential Medici family's inner circle and was supported by them in his work. He founded the Florentine Academy, which became a center of learning and discussion for Renaissance humanists. In addition to his work in philosophy and astrology, Ficino was also an accomplished musician and composer.</p><p>Ficino was born into a family of physicians and was expected to follow in their footsteps. However, his interests lay in philosophy and the arts, and he pursued these subjects with great passion. He studied under several notable humanists, including Lorenzo Valla and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. Ficino was also deeply influenced by his knowledge of ancient Greek philosophy, which he believed held the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe.</p><p>Ficino's most famous work is his "Platonic Theology," a summary of the ideas found in the works of Plato and other Greek philosophers. In this work, Ficino argued that there was a fundamental unity to all knowledge and that the study of philosophy could lead to a greater understanding of God and the universe. He also believed that music and mathematics could be used to understand the underlying structure of the universe.</p><p>In addition to his work on philosophy, Ficino was also an important figure in the field of astrology. He believed that the movements of the planets and stars could be used to interpret human behavior and predicted that the alignment of planets in 1484 would mark the beginning of a new era of peace and prosperity. While this prediction did not come to fruition, Ficino's work in astrology laid the groundwork for future developments in the field.</p><p>Ficino's contributions to the Renaissance have had a lasting impact on the world of philosophy and the humanities. His emphasis on humanism and the study of ancient Greek philosophy helped pave the way for the Enlightenment and the modern era of scientific inquiry. His work also had a profound influence on the art and literature of the Renaissance, inspiring artists and writers to seek out new forms of expression and explore new ideas.</p><p>Ficino's influence also extended to the world of medicine. As a physician himself, he believed in treating not just the physical symptoms of an illness, but also a person's mental and spiritual well-being. He advocated for a holistic approach to medicine that took into account a patient's emotional and psychological state, as well as their physical health. Ficino also believed that music had therapeutic properties and could be used to help heal the body and mind.</p><p>Ficino's legacy can be seen in the many works of art and literature that were inspired by his ideas. Several of Shakespeare's plays, such as "The Tempest" and "Romeo and Juliet," were influenced by Ficino's philosophy of Neoplatonism. The art of the Italian Renaissance, with its focus on harmony and proportion, can also be traced back to Ficino's ideas about the underlying structure of the universe. Even today, his ideas continue to inform our understanding of the world and our place in it.</p><p></p><p>

was
an Italian
writer.

Basile was also a courtier and government official, serving in various positions throughout his life, including as a judge and diplomat. Additionally, he wrote poetry, plays, and other works in both Italian and Neapolitan dialect. Despite his significant contributions to literature, Basile's work was not widely recognized during his lifetime and he died in relative obscurity. It was not until the 20th century that his work gained greater recognition and acclaim.</p><p>Basile was born in Naples, Italy to a noble family. His father, a civil servant, encouraged his son's education and love of literature. Basile himself pursued a career in law and government, serving in various positions throughout his life. His work as a judge and diplomat exposed him to the diverse cultures and folklore of the regions he visited, which likely influenced his fairy tale collection.</p><p>Basile's "Lo cunto de li cunti" is arranged as a series of stories told by ten different storytellers, each providing their own take on traditional folk tales. The collection is notable for its use of dialect, including Neapolitan and Sicilian, as well as Basile's inclusion of bawdy and humorous elements. This departure from the more refined and moralistic fairy tales of the time may have contributed to the collection's initial lack of recognition.</p><p>In addition to his literary contributions, Basile also had a turbulent personal life. He married twice and had several children, but his marriage to his second wife was reportedly unhappy, leading to rumors of infidelity and even murder. These rumors may have contributed to his reputation for scandal and led to his relative obscurity in later years.</p><p>Despite this, Basile's legacy lives on through his influential fairy tale collection and the continued popularity of his work. His contributions to Italian literature and fairy tales have earned him a place in literary history.</p><p>Basile's literary style was marked by his use of vivid descriptions and lively dialogue, which appealed to both the aristocracy and the common people. His work as a civil servant also allowed him to explore the political, social, and cultural climate of Italy during his time. This perspective is also evident in his literary works, particularly in his use of satire and wit in his poetry and plays.</p><p>In addition, Basile was a polyglot and had a love for languages. He was fluent in several languages, including Greek, Latin, French, and Spanish, and he was known to incorporate phrases and expressions from these languages into his writing. This love for language also led him to write a treatise on linguistic theory, which explored the origins, structure, and evolution of language.</p><p>Despite his relative obscurity in his lifetime, Basile's contributions to literary and linguistic history have gained him recognition in modern times. His work has been translated into numerous languages and has inspired countless adaptations and retellings. His influence on the fairy tale genre and Italian literature as a whole is still celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>

He was known for his skillful use of light and shadow, dynamic composition, and vivid color palette. In addition to his painting, Lanfranco was also a skilled draftsman and architect, contributing to the design of several churches in Rome. He played a significant role in the development of Baroque art and his works continue to be appreciated for their beauty and creativity.</p><p>Lanfranco was born in Parma, Italy, and trained in the workshop of Agostino Carracci before moving to Rome in 1602. He quickly made a name for himself in the art world, and his works were sought after by many prominent patrons, including Cardinal Scipione Borghese and the Barberini family. Lanfranco was often commissioned to create large-scale frescoes in churches and palaces, and his religious art was particularly admired for its emotional intensity.</p><p>One of Lanfranco's most famous works is the "Glorification of the Barberini Family" in the Barberini Palace in Rome. This monumental ceiling fresco depicts the Barberini family ascending to heaven, surrounded by angels and other celestial beings.

(May 8, 1920		Patti-March 22, 1986			Voghera)


was
an Italian
banker, mafioso and lawyer.


					</p><p>Sindona began his career as a lawyer after graduating from the University of Messina in 1942. In the 1950s, he transitioned into banking and became a prominent figure in Italian finance. However, his involvement with the Mafia led to legal troubles, including convictions for fraud and other crimes. </p><p>In the 1970s, Sindona moved to the United States, where he continued his financial activities and became involved in political and diplomatic circles. However, his criminal activities caught up with him and he was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to 25 years in prison in 1980.</p><p>While behind bars, Sindona attempted to arrange the murder of a witness against him and was suspected of involvement in the deaths of several other individuals. On March 22, 1986, he himself was poisoned with cyanide while in prison and died soon after. The circumstances surrounding his death remain a mystery to this day.</p><p>Sindona's rise to power in Italy during the 1950s and 60s was fueled by his aggressive approach to banking, which involved acquiring numerous small banks and consolidating them into larger, more profitable institutions. This strategy earned him a great deal of wealth and influence, but also attracted the attention of the Mafia, with whom Sindona developed close ties.</p><p>After moving to the US in the late 1970s, Sindona's financial empire began to crumble. He had invested heavily in real estate and other ventures that failed, leaving him deeply in debt. In an effort to avoid prosecution and secure his financial future, he began to cooperate with the US government and provide information on the Mafia and other criminal organizations. However, his attempts to strike a deal with federal prosecutors were unsuccessful, and he was ultimately convicted of a number of crimes, including fraud, perjury, and obstruction of justice.</p><p>Despite his criminal activities, Sindona was a respected figure in political and diplomatic circles, and he was known to have close ties to several high-ranking officials in both Italy and the US. His death by cyanide poisoning while in prison was widely believed to be the result of his involvement in various criminal activities, although the exact circumstances of his death remain unknown. Overall, Sindona's life and career were a testament to the interconnectedness of finance, crime, and politics during the postwar period in Italy and the US.</p><p>Sindona's criminal activities extended beyond his ties to the Mafia and his financial fraud convictions. He was also implicated in the murder of Italian journalist Mino Pecorelli, who was known for his investigative reporting on political corruption in Italy. Pecorelli was shot dead in Rome in 1979, and Sindona was suspected of involvement due to his connections to politicians and powerful business figures in the country. In addition, Sindona was linked to the Banco Ambrosiano scandal, which involved the collapse of Italy's largest private bank in 1982 after it was discovered that the bank had been involved in illegal financial transactions, including money laundering for the Mafia. Sindona was found to have been involved in the scandal and was suspected of having a role in the murder of the bank's chairman, Roberto Calvi, although he was not charged with the crime. Sindona's complex web of criminal activities and connections made him a notorious figure in Italian and American history.</p><p></p><p>
