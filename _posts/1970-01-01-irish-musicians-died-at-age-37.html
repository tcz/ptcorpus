(April 5, 1772		Dublin-March 24, 1810			County Wicklow)


was
an Irish
writer and poet.


					</p><p>Mary Tighe is best known for her only published work, a long narrative poem titled "Psyche; or, The Legend of Love," which was published posthumously in 1811. The poem, which is written in Spenserian stanzas, recounts the story of the Greek mythological figure Psyche and her love affair with Cupid. </p><p>Tighe was a member of the Anglo-Irish gentry and grew up in a wealthy family. She was well-educated and fluent in several languages. She married a fellow Protestant, Henry Tighe, in 1793, and the couple had five children. </p><p>Aside from her literary pursuits, Tighe was also known for her philanthropic work. She was an active member of charitable organizations in her community, particularly those focused on education and poverty relief. </p><p>Despite her relatively short life and limited literary output, Tighe's work was well-received and praised by her contemporaries. Today, she is considered an important figure in the literary history of Ireland and is remembered for her contributions to the Romantic movement.</p><p>In addition to being a gifted writer and philanthropist, Mary Tighe was also known for her musical talents. She was an accomplished musician and composer, and often entertained guests with her performances. Her husband also had a passion for music, and together they hosted musical salons in their home. Despite her privileged upbringing, Tighe was not immune to tragedy. She lost several family members, including her sister and two of her children, to illness. Tighe's own health began to deteriorate in the early 1800s, and she eventually succumbed to tuberculosis in 1810 at the age of 37. Her legacy lives on through her poetry, which continues to be studied and enjoyed by readers today.</p><p>After Mary Tighe's death, her husband Henry Tighe worked to preserve and publish her literary works. He struggled with the decision of whether to release them as he believed it could negatively affect their place in high society. However, he eventually published "Psyche; or, The Legend of Love" in 1811, a year after her death. The poem received critical acclaim, with many praising Tighe's use of language and her ability to convey emotion. Her work was particularly influential in the development of the Romantic movement in Ireland.</p><p>Mary Tighe's life has been the subject of several biographies and literary studies. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in her work, with scholars analyzing her poetry in the context of Romanticism and the literary traditions of her time. Several of her letters and journals have also been discovered, shedding light on her personal life and experiences. Despite her relatively short career as a writer, Mary Tighe left a significant mark on Irish literature and remains an important figure in the country's cultural history.</p><p></p><p>
