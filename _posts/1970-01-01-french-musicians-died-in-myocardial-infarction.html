						</p><p>Jacques Pills was not just an actor but also a popular French singer in the 1930s and 1940s. He began his career as a cabaret singer before transitioning to film and theater. He often collaborated with his famous wife, French singer and actress Lucienne Boyer, on music and performances. Pills was known for his charming persona and his smooth baritone voice that enchanted audiences. He appeared in over 20 films and many stage productions throughout his career. Jacques Pills passed away in Paris in 1970 at the age of 64.</p><p>Pills was born in Tulle, France, in 1906, and grew up in Bordeaux. He began singing professionally in his 20s and quickly gained popularity. His breakout hit, "Chanson pour ma brune," became a classic of French chanson music.</p><p>Pills performed in many popular venues of the era, including Moulin Rouge, Casino de Paris, and Olympia. He also starred in a number of French films, including the comedy "Tout va très bien madame la marquise" and the drama "Les Amants de Montparnasse."</p><p>Pills met Lucienne Boyer, who was already a famous singer at the time, in the early 1930s. The two fell in love and began to perform together on stage and in films. They became known as the "Golden Couple" of French entertainment and were a beloved duo throughout their career.</p><p>After World War II, Pills continued to perform both as a solo artist and with Boyer. He was a versatile performer, equally at home singing romantic ballads or performing comedic skits. His death in 1970 was a great loss to the French entertainment industry, but his legacy as one of the greats of French chanson music lives on.</p><p></p><p>
