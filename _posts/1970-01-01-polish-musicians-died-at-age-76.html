(August 23, 1776		Wolsztyn-August 9, 1853			Paris)

	
		also known as Jozef Maria Hoene-Wronski

	
was
a Polish
mathematician and philosopher.


					</p><p>Hoene-Wroński was born into a noble family and received a Jesuit education. He initially studied law and administration, but he later became interested in mathematics and philosophy. He worked as a mathematics teacher and held a number of academic positions, including at the University of Vilnius.</p><p>Hoene-Wroński's philosophical ideas centered on the concept of "absolute knowledge," which he believed could be obtained through mathematics. He argued that mathematics was not just a tool for practical applications, but a discipline that could provide insight into the ultimate nature of reality.</p><p>In addition to his mathematical and philosophical work, Hoene-Wroński was also involved in politics. He was a supporter of Polish independence and was involved in the unsuccessful November Uprising of 1830-31. After the uprising was defeated, he lived in France for the rest of his life and continued to write on mathematics and philosophy.</p><p>Hoene-Wroński's ideas had a significant impact on later philosophers and mathematicians, including Bertrand Russell and Georg Cantor. However, his work was largely ignored in his own time, and he lived in poverty for much of his life.</p><p>Despite facing financial hardships, Hoene-Wroński continued to pursue his academic and philosophical interests with great dedication. He wrote extensively on a wide range of topics, from algebra and geometry to theology and metaphysics. One of his major achievements was the development of a new system of algebraic notation, which he called "algebra of thought." This system aimed to unify mathematical and philosophical language and overcome the limitations of traditional algebraic notation.</p><p>Hoene-Wroński's legacy continued to be recognized in the decades following his death. In the early 20th century, his work was rediscovered by a group of French mathematicians and philosophers known as the "Bourbaki group." This led to a renewed interest in his ideas and the publication of several of his previously unpublished works.</p><p>Today, Hoene-Wroński is widely regarded as one of the most original and innovative thinkers of his time. His work had a profound impact on the development of mathematics, philosophy, and other fields, and his ideas continue to inspire new generations of scholars and thinkers.</p><p></p><p>
