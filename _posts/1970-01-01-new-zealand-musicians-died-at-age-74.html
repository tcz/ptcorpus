(July 12, 1821		London-August 3, 1895			Wellington)


was
a New Zealand
lawyer.


					</p><p>Richmond was a key figure in the early years of New Zealand's political and legal systems. He was the first New Zealand-born lawyer to be admitted to the Bar, and later became the first barrister appointed to the Legislative Council. </p><p>Throughout his career, Richmond was a vocal advocate for the rights of Maori people, and worked to bridge the cultural divide between Maori and European settlers. He played a key role in the establishment of the Native Land Court, which helped to resolve land disputes between Maori tribes and European settlers.</p><p>Beyond his legal work, Richmond was also involved in politics, serving as a member of the Wellington Provincial Council and the Legislative Council. He was known for his liberal views and his support for social reform, and worked throughout his life to promote the well-being of all New Zealanders. Today, he is remembered as one of New Zealand's most important legal and political figures.</p><p>Richmond was born into a prominent family - his father was a Member of Parliament and his grandfather was a bishop in the Anglican Church. He was educated at Christ's College in London before returning to New Zealand to study law. After being admitted to the Bar in 1847, Richmond began his legal career in Wellington, where he quickly established a reputation as a skilled litigator.</p><p>Richmond's legal work often brought him into contact with Maori chiefs, and he developed a deep respect for their culture and traditions. He was fluent in te reo Maori and often acted as an interpreter in court proceedings. Richmond believed that the British legal system had much to learn from the Maori system of justice, and he worked to integrate some aspects of Maori customary law into the British legal framework.</p><p>In addition to his legal and political work, Richmond was also a patron of the arts. He was a talented watercolorist and a collector of Maori art and artifacts, and his collection formed the basis of the Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Richmond's life was not without tragedy. He lost his wife, Emma, and their five children to a series of illnesses and accidents over the years. Despite these setbacks, he remained committed to his work and continued to advocate for justice and equality for all New Zealanders until his death in 1895.</p><p>Richmond's legacy continues to be felt in New Zealand today. The Native Land Court, which he helped to establish, is still in operation and serves as an important forum for resolving disputes over land ownership. His advocacy for Maori rights and his efforts to bridge the cultural divide between Maori and European settlers helped to lay the groundwork for the Treaty of Waitangi, a founding document of New Zealand's modern-day constitutional arrangements.In recognition of his many achievements, Richmond was knighted in 1882. A statue of him stands in Wellington, where he spent much of his life, and a scholarship in his name is awarded annually to students of Maori descent who are studying law. Richmond remains an inspiration to generations of New Zealanders who have followed in his footsteps, and his contribution to his country's history and culture is widely celebrated.</p><p>Richmond's interest in the arts extended beyond collecting Maori artifacts and watercolor painting. He was also a supporter of the theatre and was involved in the establishment of the Shakespeare Society of New Zealand. In addition, he was a founding member of the Wellington Club, a gentleman's social club that provided a place for members of Wellington's elite to socialize and network. Richmond's involvement in the club reflected his position as a member of Wellington's social and political elite. His social connections helped him to advance his career and advocate for social reform in New Zealand. Despite his privileged position, Richmond remained committed to the cause of justice and equality, and his contributions to New Zealand's legal and political systems have had a lasting impact.</p><p></p><p>
