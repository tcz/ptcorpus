							Igo Sym began his career as an actor in the 1920s, performing in various German and Austrian theaters. He also appeared in several films throughout the 1930s, including starring roles in "Unter Geschwistern" and "Der Tiger von Eschnapur". </p><p>During World War II, Sym was conscripted into the German Army and served on the Eastern Front. After being wounded in battle, he was released from service and returned to acting. However, his patriotic and pro-German leanings led him to become a propagandist for the Nazis, performing in front of troops and making radio broadcasts.</p><p>On March 7, 1941, Sym was assassinated in Warsaw by a member of the Polish resistance. His death has been the subject of much debate and speculation, with some arguing that he was specifically targeted for his propaganda work, while others believe he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Regardless of the circumstances, his tragic end remains a testament to the complex political and cultural landscape of wartime Europe.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=13216849" title="Wikipedia article about Igo Sym">Igo Sym on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-lupus-erythematosus.html' title='Famous actors died in Lupus erythematosus'><strong>Famous actors died in Lupus erythematosus</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actors who died in Lupus erythematosus</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actors-died-in-1969.html' title='Indian actors died in 1969'><strong>Indian actors died in 1969</strong> List of the top 2 Indian actors who died in 1969</a></li><li><a href='/singaporean-musicians-died-at-age-34.html' title='Singaporean musicians died at age 34'><strong>Singaporean musicians died at age 34</strong> List of the top 2 Singaporean music stars who died when they were 34</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/french-actors-died-in-1977.html' title='French actors died in 1977'><strong>French actors died in 1977</strong> List of the top 9 French actors who died in 1977</a></li><li><a href='/french-actresses-died-at-age-20.html' title='French actresses died at age 20'><strong>French actresses died at age 20</strong> List of the top 1 French actresses who died when they were 20</a></li><li><a href='/bangladeshi-musicians-died-at-age-41.html' title='Bangladeshi musicians died at age 41'><strong>Bangladeshi musicians died at age 41</strong> List of the top 3 Bangladeshi music stars who died when they were 41</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
