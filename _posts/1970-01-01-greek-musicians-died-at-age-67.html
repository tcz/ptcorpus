poet and playwright.

						</p><p>Sikelianos is considered one of the most talented and influential poets of modern Greek literature. He was heavily influenced by ancient Greek mythology and culture and his works often reflected this fascination. Sikelianos was a member of the movement known as the "Generation of the 30s", a group of Greek poets who emerged in the 1930s and were known for their surrealism and use of free verse.</p><p>In addition to his literary work, Sikelianos was also an important figure in the cultural life of Greece. He organized the Delphic Festivals, a series of cultural events held in Delphi from 1927 to 1930, which attracted artists and intellectuals from all over the world. Sikelianos believed that these festivals would help to revive the spirit of ancient Greece and promote peace and unity among nations.</p><p>Despite his contributions to Greek culture, Sikelianos was not a popular figure during his lifetime. His works were often misunderstood and criticized for their complexity and lack of adherence to traditional poetic form. It was not until after his death that his legacy as a pioneering figure in modern Greek literature was fully recognized.</p><p></p><p>
