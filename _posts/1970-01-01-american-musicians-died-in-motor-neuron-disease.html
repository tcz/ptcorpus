(June 19, 1903		Yorkville-June 2, 1941			Riverdale)

	
		also known as The Iron Horse, Henry Louis Gehrig, Lou, Buster, Ludwig Heinrich Gehrig, Larrupin&#039; Lou, Biscuit Pants, Henry Louis &quot;Lou&quot; Gehrig or Henry Louis &quot;Buster&quot; Gehrig

	
was
an American
baseball player and actor.


					</p><p>He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman for the New York Yankees from 1923 until 1939, during which time he became one of the most beloved and celebrated players in the sport's history. Gehrig was a prodigious hitter and a superb fielder, winning the American League Most Valuable Player Award twice and leading the Yankees to six World Series titles. He famously gave his "Luckiest Man on the Face of the Earth" farewell speech at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939, after being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which has since been referred to as "Lou Gehrig's disease" in his honor. Despite his short life, Gehrig left an enduring legacy as one of the greatest baseball players of all time and as a model of humility, grace, and courage in the face of adversity.</p><p>Off the field, Gehrig was known for his quiet and humble demeanor, earning him the nickname "The Iron Horse." He was born in New York City and grew up in the Bronx, where he excelled in baseball and football at Columbia University. After joining the Yankees in 1923, Gehrig quickly established himself as one of the team's most valuable players, batting .295 with 23 home runs and 97 runs batted in during his rookie season.</p><p>Over the course of his career, Gehrig set numerous records and milestones, including a streak of 2,130 consecutive games played that stood for more than 50 years until it was broken by Cal Ripken Jr. in 1995. He also became the first baseball player to have his uniform number, 4, retired by a team.</p><p>Following his retirement from baseball, Gehrig pursued a career in acting and appeared in several films, including Rawhide (1938) and A Man to Remember (1938). However, his promising career was cut short when he was diagnosed with ALS in 1939, which forced him to retire from acting as well as baseball. He died just two years later at the age of 37.</p><p>Gehrig's legacy lives on, not just in his incredible feats on the field but in the countless lives he has inspired with his courage and grace in the face of adversity. The Lou Gehrig Memorial Award is still given annually to the player who best exemplifies Gehrig's character both on and off the field.</p><p></p><p>
