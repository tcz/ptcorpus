(May 9, 1923		Gdańsk-March 1, 1997)


was
a German
conductor.


						</p><p>Caridis was born in Gdańsk, Poland and raised in Germany. He studied at the Berlin Conservatory and later won a conducting competition in 1948, which launched his career as a conductor. Caridis served as principal conductor for the Duisburg and Essen opera houses in Germany, and conducted all over the world including in North America, South America, and Japan. He was known for his interpretations of modern composers such as Stravinsky and Schoenberg, but also for his interpretations of the classics. Caridis was highly respected in the music community and is remembered as an important figure in the history of conducting.</p><p>Caridis was widely known for his dynamic style, meticulous attention to detail, and commitment to bringing out the best in the musicians he worked with. One of his most notable achievements was his complete cycle of Beethoven's symphonies with the Duisburg Philharmonic Orchestra, which was praised for its emotional depth and technical precision. Caridis often collaborated with some of the most renowned soloists of his time, such as the pianist Martha Argerich and the violinist Yehudi Menuhin. In addition to his conducting work, Caridis taught at several music institutions, including the Hochschule für Musik in Munich and the Juilliard School in New York. He was a beloved mentor to many young conductors and musicians, and his legacy continues to inspire generations of performers around the world.</p><p>Despite his success as a conductor, Miltiades Caridis was also known for his activism and commitment to social justice causes. He was a vocal opponent of the Nazi regime during World War II and was forced to go into hiding in order to avoid being drafted into the German army. After the war, he worked to promote peace and reconciliation between Germany and Poland, and was an active participant in efforts to rebuild cultural ties between the two nations. Caridis also took a strong stance against apartheid in South Africa, refusing to perform there until the country had abolished the discriminatory policy. He was a supporter of the anti-war and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 70s, and used his platform as a famous conductor to raise awareness about these issues. Caridis' commitment to social justice was considered rare among classical musicians of his time, and he is remembered not only for his musical achievements, but for his activism and dedication to promoting a better world through music.</p><p>Caridis was also known for his extensive repertoire, which included works from a wide range of composers and styles. He was particularly interested in exploring the music of lesser-known composers and championing their works, often conducting pieces that had never been performed in public before. He was also deeply committed to contemporary music and regularly commissioned new works from emerging composers.</p><p>In addition to his conducting work, Caridis was an accomplished pianist and composer. He wrote several pieces for orchestra, chamber ensembles, and solo piano, which were performed in concert halls around the world. His compositions were heavily influenced by the music of his Greek heritage, as well as by the modernist and avant-garde movements of the 20th century.</p><p>Throughout his career, Caridis received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to music and culture. He was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1978 for his services to music, and was made an Honorary Citizen of Duisburg in recognition of his work as principal conductor of the city's opera house. In 1996, he was awarded the prestigious Goethe Prize by the City of Frankfurt for his outstanding contributions to German culture.</p><p>Miltiades Caridis passed away in Munich on March 1, 1997, at the age of 73.

He believed that music was an ever-evolving art form, and that it was the job of the artist to constantly explore and experiment with new styles and techniques.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Kehrer remained humble and gracious throughout his life. He was deeply committed to his family and friends, and was known for his generosity and kindness toward others. He believed that music was a gift that should be shared with as many people as possible, and he devoted himself to spreading the joy and beauty of music throughout his long and illustrious career.</p><p>Today, Rudolf Kehrer's legacy lives on through the countless musicians and students he inspired, and through his recordings and performances, which continue to captivate and move listeners around the world.
