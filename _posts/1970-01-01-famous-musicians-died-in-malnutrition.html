					</p><p>Lovecraft is best known for his works of horror fiction, particularly his creation of the fictional universe known as the Cthulhu Mythos. His writing style was marked by dense and ornate language, and he often used archaic language and invented words in his stories. Lovecraft's work has influenced many writers in the horror and science fiction genres, and has become a cult classic. Despite his popularity today, during his lifetime Lovecraft was largely unknown and struggled financially. He died at the age of 46 from complications of intestinal cancer.</p><p>Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, and spent most of his life in New England. He was homeschooled by his mother and later attended a few years of public school, but never completed high school. He was an avid reader from a young age and was particularly interested in science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Lovecraft's early writing was heavily influenced by the works of Edgar Allan Poe and Lord Dunsany.</p><p>In 1917, Lovecraft began publishing his own stories in pulp magazines, such as Weird Tales and Astounding Stories. His work was met with mixed reviews, but over time, his unique style and mythos began to gain a following. Lovecraft corresponded with many other writers and fans in his lifetime, including Robert E. Howard (creator of Conan the Barbarian) and Clark Ashton Smith.</p><p>Lovecraft's most famous works include "The Call of Cthulhu," "At the Mountains of Madness," and "The Shadow Over Innsmouth." His stories often dealt with themes of cosmic horror, insanity, and the fragility of human existence in the face of the unknown. Lovecraft's influence can be seen in the works of modern horror writers such as Stephen King and Neil Gaiman.</p><p>Despite his impact on the horror genre, Lovecraft struggled financially throughout his life and never achieved significant commercial success. He lived in poverty for much of his adult life and relied on the support of family and friends. Lovecraft never married and had no children. He died at the age of 46, leaving a legacy that has continued to grow in popularity and influence.</p><p></p><p>

(September 21, 1952		Leiblfing-July 1, 1976			Klingenberg am Main)


was
a German
, .


					</p><p>woman who underwent Catholic exorcism rites during the year before her death. She was diagnosed with epileptic psychosis, and the priest Ernst Alt, who reported that he had witnessed paranormal activity during the exorcism, was later tried and convicted of negligent homicide. The case attracted media and public attention and inspired the 2005 film The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Michel is survived by her parents and three sisters, and her grave became a pilgrimage site for believers in demonic possession and exorcism.</p><p>Anneliese Michel was born into a devoutly Catholic family and attended a school run by nuns. She suffered a seizure at the age of 16 and was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. In the years that followed, despite medical treatment, Michel's condition worsened and she began experiencing hallucinations and hearing voices. She became convinced that she was possessed by demons and sought help from the Catholic Church.</p><p>After unsuccessful attempts to cure Michel with medical treatment and psychiatric care, the Church granted permission for exorcism rites to be performed. The exorcisms were carried out over a period of several months in 1975-76, and during this time Michel's health deteriorated rapidly. She stopped eating, became emaciated and weak, and finally died of starvation and dehydration.</p><p>The subsequent trial of the Catholic priest who conducted the exorcisms, along with Michel's parents, attracted widespread attention and raised questions about the role of the Church in cases of mental illness. Michel's story has since been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries. Despite the controversy surrounding the case, her family and many believers continue to see her as a martyr and a symbol of faith.</p><p></p><p>
