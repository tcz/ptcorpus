(February 14, 1764-November 16, 1797)


was
an Irish
politician.

						</p><p>Beresford was born into a wealthy and influential family in County Tyrone, Ireland. He received his education at Eton College and later at Christ Church, Oxford. After completing his studies, he entered politics and was elected to the Irish House of Commons in 1783. Beresford quickly established himself as a brilliant orator and a staunch supporter of the British government.</p><p>In 1790, he was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, a position that he held until his death in 1797. During his time as Chief Secretary, Beresford was instrumental in the passage of several important pieces of legislation, including the Union with Ireland Act of 1800, which united Ireland with Great Britain.</p><p>Beresford was also a talented musician and composer. He was a skilled player of the flute, and his compositions, which included musical settings of poems by William Shenstone and Thomas Gray, were well-regarded in his day.</p><p>Sadly, Beresford's life was cut short by illness. He died in November 1797 at the age of 33. Even so, his legacy continued through his son, William Beresford, who went on to become a distinguished military commander and eventually a peer of the United Kingdom.</p><p>Marcus Beresford was an active philanthropist, often donating large sums of money to those in need. He was particularly generous in his support of education, and he helped found the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, one of the leading grammar schools in Northern Ireland. Beresford's interest in education was no doubt inspired by his own experiences at Eton and Oxford. He believed that education was the key to unlocking opportunity and advancement, and he worked tirelessly to ensure that as many people as possible had access to it. Besides his political and philanthropic pursuits, Beresford was also an avid horse racing enthusiast. He owned and trained several horses, and was known to attend races throughout the British Isles.

Despite his demanding political career and various other interests, Beresford made time for his family and was a loving and attentive husband and father. In fact, he was known to be a devoted family man until the end of his life. Beresford's premature death was a great loss to his family and to the wider political and social community in Ireland. Nevertheless, his many achievements and contributions have continued to inspire others and his legacy remains an important part of Irish and British history.</p><p>One of Beresford's greatest accomplishments as a politician was his work towards helping to improve living conditions for the poor. He was responsible for the passage of several laws that aimed to reduce poverty, including measures that increased taxation on absentee landlords and provided financial assistance for those in need. He also advocated for the establishment of more workhouses and hospitals to provide relief for the poor.Beresford's dedication to serving the people of Ireland was widely recognized and respected, both during his lifetime and after his death. He was known for his fierce determination, his sharp intellect, and his unwavering commitment to his principles, even in the face of opposition and adversity.

(January 24, 1832		County Wexford-December 27, 1865			Westminster)


was
an Irish
sailor.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work in developing marine chronometers, which were key in solving the problem of accurately determining longitude while at sea. One of his most famous creations was the H4, a portable chronometer that was smaller and more reliable than previous models. This invention won him a substantial reward from the British government, but he faced significant opposition from members of the scientific community who were resistant to change. Despite the challenges, Harrison's work had a profound impact on navigation and earned him a lasting legacy as a pioneer in the field of timekeeping.</p><p>Harrison was born into a seafaring family with a long tradition of excellence in sailing. He spent much of his early life at sea, working on various ships and developing a deep understanding of the challenges of navigation. His interest in marine chronometers began in his early twenties, when he encountered the problem of accurately determining longitude while on a long sea voyage. </p><p>After several years of experimentation and tinkering, Harrison successfully developed the H4, which was a breakthrough in chronometer design. The H4 was highly accurate and reliable, even in the harsh conditions of the open ocean. The British government recognized the value of the invention and awarded Harrison a prize of £20,000 in 1773, which was a staggering sum of money at the time.</p><p>Despite his success, Harrison faced significant opposition from the scientific establishment. Many prominent scientists and mathematicians believed that the problem of longitude could only be solved through astronomical observations, rather than mechanical timekeeping. Harrison spent many years defending his work and attempting to persuade skeptics of the value of his method. </p><p>Today, Harrison is widely regarded as a genius of mechanical engineering and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of timekeeping. His work paved the way for the development of accurate marine navigation, which was crucial to the success of trade and exploration in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p><p>Harrison continued to innovate in the field of chronometers and designed several more models after the H4, each one more precise and reliable than the last. He also worked on other inventions, including a marine barometer and a mechanism for preventing ships from rolling in heavy seas. However, he faced continued criticism and opposition from those who held to traditional methods of navigation. </p><p>In his later years, Harrison suffered from poor health and financial difficulties. He sought additional recognition and support for his work from the British government, but was largely unsuccessful. Despite these challenges, Harrison's contributions to science and navigation were widely recognized during his lifetime, and his name remains synonymous with precision timekeeping. His story has inspired numerous books, films, and even an opera, and his legacy lives on in modern marine navigation technology.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions, the British government awarded Harrison a series of pensions over the years, but he struggled financially for much of his life. Harrison died in 1776 at the age of 83, and he was buried in Hampstead. Despite the challenges and obstacles he faced, Harrison's legacy has endured. His inventions revolutionized navigation, contributing to the success of trade, exploration, and military expeditions. His work also had a profound impact on scientific understanding of time and measurement, paving the way for advances in astronomy, physics, and engineering. Today, Harrison is celebrated as one of the most important inventors in history, honored in museums, festivals, and academic institutions around the world. The story of his life and work is a testament to the power of ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance in pursuit of knowledge and progress.</p><p>In addition to his work on chronometers, John Harrison was also known for his advocacy for higher standards in shipbuilding and the treatment of sailors. He believed that many shipbuilders were cutting corners and using inferior materials, which put the lives of sailors at risk. He also argued that sailors deserved better pay and living conditions. Harrison's outspokenness on these issues made him a controversial figure in his time, but his ideas helped to bring about positive changes in the maritime industry.</p><p>Harrison's legacy has been celebrated in numerous ways since his death. In 2014, a memorial statue of Harrison was unveiled in his hometown of Barrow-in-Furness, England. The statue depicts Harrison with his chronometer and is inscribed with the words "The man who found the longitude". In 2018, the Royal Navy named a new ocean research vessel after Harrison, the RRS Sir David Attenborough. The ship's mission is to explore the world's oceans and study the effects of climate change. Harrison's name was chosen in recognition of his contributions to navigation and scientific discovery.</p><p>Overall, John Harrison's life and work have had a lasting impact on science, engineering, and navigation. His innovations helped to shape the modern world and continue to inspire new generations of inventors and explorers.</p><p></p><p>
