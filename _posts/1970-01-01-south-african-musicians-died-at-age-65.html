He was also involved in various cricketing organizations including the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the International Cricket Council (ICC). </p><p>Barlow remained involved in cricket until his untimely death at the age of 65.

(July 14, 1893		Cape Colony-August 24, 1958			Cape Town)

	
		also known as JG Strydom, Hans Strydom, Lion of the North or Johannes Strijdom

	
was
a South African
personality.


					</p><p>He was a political leader and served as the Prime Minister of South Africa from 1954 until his death in 1958. Strijdom was a prominent figure in the National Party, which was responsible for instituting apartheid and promoting white supremacy in South Africa. He was known for his staunch support of the discriminatory policies of apartheid, which included the forced removal of black Africans from their homes and the establishment of segregated living areas. Strijdom's leadership was marked by his efforts to strengthen apartheid policies, further entrenching the divide between white and black South Africans. His tenure as Prime Minister was cut short by his death due to a heart attack in 1958. Despite his controversial legacy, Strijdom remains a controversial figure in South African history.</p><p>During his time as Prime Minister, Strijdom also played a significant role in South Africa's foreign policy. He believed in the idea of "South African Exceptionalism", which argued that South Africa was a unique country with its own set of values and should not be subject to outside influence or interference. As a result, Strijdom supported the idea of South Africa becoming a republic and breaking away from the British Empire, which happened in 1961 after his death. </p><p>Strijdom was born in the Cape Colony in 1893, but his family moved to the Transvaal during the Second Boer War. After completing his education, he became a farmer and was involved in various political and social organizations. In 1929, he was elected to the parliament of the Union of South Africa, representing the National Party.</p><p>Strijdom was known for his hardline stance on apartheid and frequently clashed with more moderate members of his own party. He was opposed to any form of integration between whites and blacks and believed that black Africans should be given limited rights and opportunities. His policies were criticized both nationally and internationally, with many calling for boycotts and sanctions against South Africa.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, Strijdom remains a significant figure in South African history and is still celebrated by some for his contributions to the establishment of Apartheid.</p><p>During his time as Prime Minister, Strijdom also oversaw several significant developments in South Africa. He initiated the construction of the Vaal Dam, which still provides water to Johannesburg and the surrounding areas. He also introduced several economic policies aimed at promoting white economic dominance, including the establishment of a minimum wage for white workers. However, these policies further marginalized black South Africans and perpetuated the country's vast socioeconomic disparities.</p><p>Strijdom's legacy is heavily debated in contemporary South Africa, with many regarding him as a key architect of apartheid and a proponent of white supremacy. Despite this, some far-right groups in South Africa continue to lionize him and see him as a hero of sorts. Whatever one's perspective on Strijdom may be, his tenure as Prime Minister of South Africa represents a dark chapter in the country's history and reminds us of the devastating human cost of institutionalized racism and discrimination.</p><p>During his time as Prime Minister, Strijdom also played a crucial role in expanding South Africa's nuclear capabilities. He was a strong proponent of the country's nuclear program and believed that South Africa needed to establish itself as a nuclear power to protect against potential threats from other countries on the continent. Strijdom worked closely with South African nuclear physicist Cornelius Johannes van der Bijl to develop the country's nuclear program, which eventually led to the creation of a nuclear weapon in the 1970s. This nuclear program was carried out in secret and was only revealed to the international community in the early 1990s, after the fall of apartheid. Strijdom's support of the nuclear program has been criticized as reckless and dangerous, and it is widely believed that the program helped to escalate the tensions and conflicts in the region during the latter half of the 20th century.</p><p></p><p>
