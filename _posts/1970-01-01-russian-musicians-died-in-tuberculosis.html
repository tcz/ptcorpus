						Although Kalinnikov's life was short, he made significant contributions to the world of classical music during the late 19th century. Born into a peasant family in the village of Voin in Russia, Kalinnikov demonstrated an early passion for music and was largely self-taught. He moved to Moscow in 1884 to pursue his musical education and studied at the Moscow Conservatory with renowned composers such as Tchaikovsky and Taneyev.</p><p>As a composer, Kalinnikov's work is characterized by rich harmonies, soaring melodies, and a distinctive Russian style. His Symphony No. 1, which premiered in 1897, was well-received and is considered to be one of his most notable works. Kalinnikov also worked as a conductor, leading orchestras in Moscow and Kiev.</p><p>Unfortunately, Kalinnikov's career was cut short by illness. He contracted tuberculosis in his early 30s and passed away just two days before his 35th birthday. Despite his short life, Kalinnikov left a lasting legacy in the world of classical music, and his work continues to be performed and celebrated by musicians today.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=430225" title="Wikipedia article about Vasily Kalinnikov">Vasily Kalinnikov on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/jamaican-musicians-died-at-age-18.html' title='Jamaican musicians died at age 18'><strong>Jamaican musicians died at age 18</strong> List of the top 1 Jamaican music stars who died when they were 18</a></li><li><a href='/chinese-musicians-died-at-age-48.html' title='Chinese musicians died at age 48'><strong>Chinese musicians died at age 48</strong> List of the top 7 Chinese music stars who died when they were 48</a></li><li><a href='/indian-musicians-died-in-diabetes-mellitus.html' title='Indian musicians died in Diabetes mellitus'><strong>Indian musicians died in Diabetes mellitus</strong> List of the top 1 Indian music stars who died in Diabetes mellitus</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/greek-musicians-died-before-turning-18.html' title='Greek musicians died before turning 18'><strong>Greek musicians died before turning 18</strong> List of the top 82 Greek music stars who died before 18</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-musicians-died-at-age-24.html' title='Austrian musicians died at age 24'><strong>Austrian musicians died at age 24</strong> List of the top 5 Austrian music stars who died when they were 24</a></li><li><a href='/german-actresses-died-before-turning-18.html' title='German actresses died before turning 18'><strong>German actresses died before turning 18</strong> List of the top 2 German actresses who died before they turned 18</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
