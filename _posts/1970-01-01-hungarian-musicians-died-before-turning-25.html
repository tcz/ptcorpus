personality.


					</p><p>She was the daughter of Louis the Great, King of Hungary, and his second wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia. Mary was married to Sigismund of Luxembourg, who later became Holy Roman Emperor, in 1385 at the age of 14. </p><p>As Queen of Hungary, Mary was known for her patronage of the arts and education. She was also a devout Catholic and is said to have supported the building of several churches and monasteries. </p><p>Mary and Sigismund had no children together, and after her death at the age of 24, Sigismund remarried and went on to have several children.

In 1387, she played a crucial role in negotiating a peace treaty between her father and the Ottoman Empire, which temporarily halted the Ottoman expansion into Europe. She also worked towards strengthening Hungary's alliances with neighboring countries, including Poland and Austria. </p><p>Mary's marriage to Sigismund of Luxembourg was not always a happy one, as the couple faced several challenges and controversies throughout their relationship. In 1392, Sigismund was accused of plotting against Mary's brother, King Ladislaus, and was briefly imprisoned by him. It is also said that Sigismund was unfaithful to Mary, possibly even fathering a child with one of her ladies-in-waiting. </p><p>Despite these challenges, Mary remains a notable figure in Hungarian history, and is often portrayed as a symbol of the country's cultural and artistic achievements during the Late Middle Ages. Her patronage of the arts and education helped to establish several institutions that continued to thrive long after her death, leaving a lasting legacy on Hungary's cultural heritage.</p><p></p><p>
