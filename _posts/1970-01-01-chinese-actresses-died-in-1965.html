							Beryl Measor, also known by her Chinese name, Mei Lanfang (梅兰芳), was a highly acclaimed Peking opera performer, known for her exceptional skill in male roles. Born in Shanghai to a British father and a Chinese mother, Measor started training in Peking opera at a young age under the guidance of her mother's uncle, a famous Peking opera master. She made her professional debut at the age of 18 and quickly rose to fame, becoming one of the leading performers of her time. Measor's performances were characterized by her grace, elegance, and mastery of the art of "female impersonation" in male roles, which made her a cultural icon in China. In 1935, Measor toured Europe and North America, performing to sold-out audiences and earning rave reviews from critics. She eventually settled in London and continued to perform and teach Peking opera until her death in 1965. Measor is widely regarded as one of the greatest Peking opera performers of all time, and her legacy continues to inspire generations of Chinese opera enthusiasts.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=42247213" title="Wikipedia article about Beryl Measor">Beryl Measor on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/dutch-musicians-died-at-age-66.html' title='Dutch musicians died at age 66'><strong>Dutch musicians died at age 66</strong> List of the top 19 Dutch music stars who died when they were 66</a></li><li><a href='/norwegian-actresses-died-in-1969.html' title='Norwegian actresses died in 1969'><strong>Norwegian actresses died in 1969</strong> List of the top 3 Norwegian actresses who died in 1969</a></li><li><a href='/czechoslovakian-musicians-died-at-age-79.html' title='Czechoslovakian musicians died at age 79'><strong>Czechoslovakian musicians died at age 79</strong> List of the top 5 Czechoslovakian music stars who died when they were 79</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swiss-actresses-died-in-1995.html' title='Swiss actresses died in 1995'><strong>Swiss actresses died in 1995</strong> List of the top 1 Swiss actresses who died in 1995</a></li><li><a href='/german-actors-died-in-1965.html' title='German actors died in 1965'><strong>German actors died in 1965</strong> List of the top 9 German actors who died in 1965</a></li><li><a href='/serbian-actors-died-in-1997.html' title='Serbian actors died in 1997'><strong>Serbian actors died in 1997</strong> List of the top 1 Serbian actors who died in 1997</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
