soldier, writer and poet.


					</p><p>He was one of the leading poets of the First World War and his works often depict the harsh realities of trench warfare and the physical and emotional toll it had on the soldiers. Owen served as a lieutenant in the war and was awarded the Military Cross for his bravery. However, he was killed in action one week before the Armistice was signed, and his parents received the telegram informing them of his death on November 11, 1918 - the same day the war officially ended. Despite his short life, Owen's poetry has had a significant impact on English literature and is still studied and celebrated today.</p><p>Owen began writing poetry at a young age and was heavily influenced by the Romantic poets, such as Keats and Shelley. He attended the University of London but had to leave due to financial difficulties. At the outbreak of the First World War, he enlisted in the Artists' Rifles and was sent to France in 1917. It was during his time in the trenches that he developed his unique poetic style, marked by its vivid imagery and use of pararhyme. </p><p>Owen's poetry is now considered a powerful commentary on the futility of war and the tragic loss of life that it causes. Many of his most famous works, such as "Dulce et Decorum Est" and "Anthem for Doomed Youth," were written during his time on the Western Front. After his death, his mother Susan Owen worked tirelessly to promote his poetry and ensure that it was published. His collected works were finally published in 1920, with an introduction by Siegfried Sassoon, another famous war poet. </p><p>Today, Owen is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential poets of the 20th century. His work has been translated into dozens of languages and has inspired countless writers, artists, and musicians. In 1985, he was posthumously awarded the Sassoon Prize for Poetry, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of readers and poets.</p><p>Owen's poetry was not always well-received during his lifetime, and it was only after his death that his work gained widespread recognition. This was due in part to the efforts of his friend and fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon, who worked to promote his work and ensure that it was published. Sassoon recognized the power of Owen's poetry to convey the experiences of soldiers and the horrors of war in a way that was both visceral and emotionally resonant.</p><p>In addition to his poetry, Owen was also a talented letter writer, and his correspondence with his family and friends provides valuable insights into his experiences during the war. He was deeply affected by the suffering he saw around him and struggled with feelings of guilt over his own survival. He also struggled with his sexuality and wrote candidly about his attraction to men, a taboo subject at the time.</p><p>Despite his early death, Owen left a lasting legacy through his poetry, which has continued to resonate with readers and audiences around the world. His work stands as a powerful reminder of the human cost of war and the need for compassion and empathy in the face of suffering.</p><p>In 1918, Owen met another famous war poet, Robert Graves, in Edinburgh. Graves helped Owen edit and revise his poems, and introduced him to literary figures such as H.G. Wells and Arnold Bennett. Owen's poetry began to receive more recognition, and he was invited to give readings of his work at various venues.The end of the war was not far off, but Owen continued to serve on the front lines. In October 1918, he was awarded the Military Cross for his bravery during the Battle of the Sambre, but just one week later, he was killed in action near the Sambre–Oise Canal. His mother received the telegram informing her of his death on November 11, 1918 - the same day the Armistice was signed.Owen's death at such a young age, and the powerful themes of his poetry, have cemented his place in the literary canon as one of the greatest war poets of all time. His legacy continues to inspire readers and writers to this day, and his poems are still studied and analyzed in schools and universities around the world.</p><p>Despite his short life and his early death, Wilfred Owen is considered as one of the most influential poets of the First World War. His poetry reveals the horrors of war from a soldier's perspective and bears witness to the atrocities of trench warfare. One of the defining features of Owen's poetry is its raw intensity, marked by graphic imagery and vivid descriptions of the trauma and violence of war. For instance, his famous poem "Dulce et Decorum Est" describes a gas attack, and its haunting final lines urge the reader to "watch the white eyes writhing in his face" of the soldier who succumbs to it. </p><p>Owen's poetry also touches on broader themes of sacrifice, duty, and patriotism, and often challenges the traditional glorification of war as noble and heroic. In "Anthem for Doomed Youth," for example, he laments the senseless loss of life in the war, and asks "What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?" Owen's poetry has been praised for its honesty, compassion, and emotional depth, and is considered one of the most powerful and moving accounts of the First World War.</p><p>In recent years, Owen's poetry has undergone a revival in popularity, thanks in part to the many adaptations and references to his work in popular culture. His poem "Strange Meeting," for example, has been used in films, books, and music to illustrate the devastating impact of war on soldiers and civilians alike. In 2018, on the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War, Owen's poetry once again took center stage as part of the national commemorations in the UK. His legacy as a poet of war continues to inspire new generations of readers and writers, and his work remains an important reminder of the sacrifices made by soldiers in times of conflict.</p><p></p><p>
