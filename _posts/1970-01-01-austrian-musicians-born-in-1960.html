an Austrian
, .


						</p><p>composer, performer, improviser, and computer musician known for his work in electronic and contemporary classical music. He studied composition with Friedrich Cerha and participated in masterclasses with György Ligeti, Morton Feldman, and Iannis Xenakis. In addition to his work as a composer, Essl has also written extensively on music theory and computer music. He has been awarded numerous prizes and honors for his contributions to the field, including the Vienna Composition Prize, the Austrian State Prize for Composition, and the Prix Ars Electronica. Today, he continues to perform and compose music while also teaching at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna.</p><p>Essl's music is often characterized by innovative approaches to the use of technology in music composition and performance. He has described his compositions as "algorithmic compositions," which are created using a variety of computer programs that he has developed himself. These programs allow him to create complex soundscapes that can be altered and manipulated in real-time during performances. </p><p>In addition to his work in electronic music, Essl has also written for traditional instruments and ensembles, such as his work for string quartet entitled "Sequitur III." He is also well-known for his improvisation skills, which he has showcased in performances with musicians such as the American jazz saxophonist Steve Lacy. </p><p>In the realm of music theory, Essl has published several books and articles on topics such as algorithmic composition, microtonality, and the use of technology in music education. He has also been involved in the development of computer programs for teaching music, such as "EarMaster," which is used by musicians around the world to develop their ear training skills. </p><p>Essl's contributions to contemporary music have been widely recognized with performances of his work taking place at international festivals such as the Salzburg Festival, the Donaueschingen Festival, and the Gaudeamus Music Week. He has also been a visiting professor at several prestigious universities around the world, such as Stanford University, the California Institute of the Arts, and the University of Music and Performing Arts in Graz, Austria.</p><p>Essl's interest in music began at a young age when he started taking piano lessons. As a teenager, he started exploring the avant-garde and electronic music, which eventually led him to study composition with Friedrich Cerha at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna. After completing his studies, he began experimenting with computer music, creating his own software applications and programming languages to generate new sounds and compositions.</p><p>In addition to his work as a composer and music theorist, Essl has also been an advocate for open-source software and the democratization of music technology. He has given lectures and workshops around the world, promoting the use of free software and open-source technology in music education and composition. Essl has also been involved in the creation of several online platforms for collaborative music-making, such as the "Online Ensemble" project, which allows musicians from around the world to create music together in real-time over the Internet.</p><p>Despite his success and accolades, Essl remains grounded and committed to experimentation and collaboration. He sees his work as part of a larger creative process that involves a dialogue between artists, technology, and audiences. "Music is not just about notes and sounds," he has said, "it's about communication and interaction, about bringing people together and creating something new and unexpected."</p><p></p><p>
