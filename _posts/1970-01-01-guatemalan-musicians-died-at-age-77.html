(December 11, 1903		Guatemala City-April 4, 1981			Livingston)

	
		a.k.a. Alfred Jensen or Alfred Julio Jensen

	
was
a Guatemalan
personality.


					</p><p>He was an abstract painter known for his complex, mathematically-inspired compositions. Jensen studied at the San Francisco Art Institute and the California School of Fine Arts before going on to exhibit extensively throughout Europe and the United States. His work often featured dense, overlapping patterns and vibrant colors, reflecting his interest in the interplay between science, mythology, and spirituality. Jensen was also a proponent of the concept of harmony in art, often working in suites that explored different color combinations and geometric motifs. Today, his works can be found in numerous public and private collections, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.</p><p>Jensen was born to Danish and Mexican parents, and spent his childhood years in Guatemala. Later, he moved to San Francisco and settled there. While initially he practiced as a commercial artist, he soon realized his passion for abstract painting. Jensen's painting process was meticulous, and he often spent years working on a single piece. In addition to painting, he also authored several books on art theory, including "Notes on Color" and "The Structure of Color." </p><p>Jensen's interest in science, mathematics, and mythology led him to develop a unique artistic language that incorporated these diverse influences. He believed that color and form could be used to communicate complex philosophical concepts and spiritual ideas. Although his work was not widely recognized during his lifetime, it has since become highly regarded by art historians and collectors. Jensen's legacy continues to influence contemporary artists who share his fascination with the intersection of art and science.</p><p>In the 1960s, Jensen became associated with the Op Art movement, which was characterized by optical illusions and geometric patterns. However, unlike many Op artists who used machines to create their works, Jensen meticulously painted each element by hand. His works during this period featured repeating geometric motifs and explored the relationship between colors and their interaction with one another. </p><p>Jensen was also known for his interest in numerology and the Kaballah, which he incorporated into his art. His compositions often featured symbols and numbers which he assigned specific meanings to. He also believed in the importance of the viewer's experience with his art, and encouraged viewers to spend time observing and contemplating his works in order to fully appreciate their complexity.</p><p>Despite his growing reputation within the art world, Jensen struggled with poverty for much of his life. He often relied on the support of friends and family, and frequently bartered his paintings for food and other necessities. Despite these difficulties, Jensen continued to paint until his death in 1981 at the age of 77. Today, his works are highly sought after by collectors and can fetch upwards of six figures at auction.</p><p></p><p>
