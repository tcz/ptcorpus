							Nara Leão was a prominent figure in the Bossa Nova music movement in Brazil during the 1960s. She began her singing career in 1963 and quickly gained popularity with her distinctive voice and interpretation of songs by composers such as Tom Jobim, Vinicius de Moraes, and João Gilberto. Her first album, "Nara" (1964), was a huge success and cemented her status as one of the leading voices of the Bossa Nova genre. </p><p>As her career progressed, Nara Leão became increasingly involved in the political movements of her time, particularly the student protests against Brazil's military dictatorship. She was a close friend of fellow musician and political activist Chico Buarque, and many of her later recordings featured songs that addressed social issues and criticized the government. </p><p>In addition to her music career, Nara Leão also appeared in several films, including "Garrincha: Hero of the Jungle" (1963) and "The Guns" (1964). She continued to perform and record music until her death in 1989 at the age of 47. Despite her relatively short career, she left an indelible mark on Brazilian music and remains a beloved figure to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=7787367" title="Wikipedia article about Nara Leão">Nara Leão on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/german-actresses-died-in-breast-cancer.html' title='German actresses died in Breast cancer'><strong>German actresses died in Breast cancer</strong> List of the top 2 German actresses who died in Breast cancer</a></li><li><a href='/bulgarian-musicians-died-at-age-68.html' title='Bulgarian musicians died at age 68'><strong>Bulgarian musicians died at age 68</strong> List of the top 5 Bulgarian music stars who died when they were 68</a></li><li><a href='/brazilian-actresses-died-before-turning-35.html' title='Brazilian actresses died before turning 35'><strong>Brazilian actresses died before turning 35</strong> List of the top 3 Brazilian actresses who died before they turned 35</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-subdural-hematoma.html' title='Famous musicians died in Subdural hematoma'><strong>Famous musicians died in Subdural hematoma</strong> List of the top 1 Famous music stars who died in Subdural hematoma</a></li><li><a href='/eritrean-actors-died-in-2013.html' title='Eritrean actors died in 2013'><strong>Eritrean actors died in 2013</strong> List of the top 1 Eritrean actors who died in 2013</a></li><li><a href='/greek-musicians-died-before-turning-18.html' title='Greek musicians died before turning 18'><strong>Greek musicians died before turning 18</strong> List of the top 82 Greek music stars who died before 18</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
