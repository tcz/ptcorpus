(March 6, 1716		Ångermanland-November 16, 1779			Turku)

	
		a.k.a. Peter Kalm or Pietari Kalm

	
was
a Finnish
scientist and botanist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work exploring the natural history of North America, particularly the plants and wildlife of the area. Kalm traveled extensively through North America from 1748 to 1751, journeying as far north as Quebec and as far south as Philadelphia. During his travels, he collected numerous specimens of plants and animals, many of which were previously unknown to science. Kalm also kept detailed journals of his experiences, providing valuable insights into the social, economic, and cultural aspects of colonial America. In addition to his work as a naturalist, Kalm was also a professor of economics and a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.</p><p>Kalm was born in a small village in the northern part of Sweden but spent most of his life in Finland, where he studied natural sciences and theology. His interest in botany was sparked by his mentor, the renowned Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus. Kalm became one of Linnaeus's most dedicated students and was eventually sent to North America on a scientific mission. </p><p>Kalm's journey through North America was not without its challenges. He faced harsh weather, dangerous animals, and language barriers, but he persevered and managed to make a significant contribution to the scientific knowledge of the continent. Kalm's account of his travels, titled "Travels into North America," was published in Sweden and is still considered a classic work of natural history. </p><p>After returning to Europe, Kalm continued to study and write about botany, publishing several works on the subject. He also held teaching positions in Finland, where he worked to promote scientific education and research. Today, Kalm is remembered as one of the most important naturalists of the 18th century and a pioneer of early American science.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to natural history, Pehr Kalm also played an important role in promoting the cultivation of new crops in Finland. He introduced several North American plant species to Finland, including the potato, whose cultivation Kalm championed. His efforts helped to expand agricultural production and improve food security in Finland.</p><p>Despite his significant contributions to science, Kalm's legacy was overshadowed by political turmoil in Finland during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was not until the mid-20th century that his work began to be recognized and celebrated. Today, Kalm is honored with several institutions and landmarks named after him, including the Kalm Garden in Turku, Finland and Pehr Kalm Island in Lake Superior, Ontario, Canada. His contributions to botany and natural history continue to inspire scientists and researchers around the world.</p><p></p><p>
