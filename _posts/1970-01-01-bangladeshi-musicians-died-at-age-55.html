He served twice as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, first from 1972 to 1975 and then again briefly in 1975. </p><p>Rahman was known for his strong leadership and charisma, which helped galvanize the Bengali nationalist movement. He led the Awami League political party and played a key role in negotiating with the Pakistani government for the recognition of Bangladesh as an independent nation. </p><p>After Bangladesh gained independence, Rahman faced many challenges, including rebuilding the war-torn country and establishing a functioning government.
