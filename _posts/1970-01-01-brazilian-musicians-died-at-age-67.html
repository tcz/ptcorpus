a Brazilian
personality.

She received her art training at the National School of Fine Arts in Rio de Janeiro, and later studied with artists including Fernand Léger and Arpad Szenes in Paris.</p><p>Clark's works were notable for their interaction with the viewer, often involving physical and sensorial engagement. She created a range of provocative works, from wearable sculptures that could be manipulated by the wearer to larger installations that required participation from the audience.</p><p>Later in her career, Clark became increasingly interested in therapeutic art practices and developed a series of exercises aimed at promoting self-awareness and well-being. She was a major influence on the development of contemporary Brazilian art, as well as on the global art world more broadly.</p><p>Her works have been exhibited internationally, including at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Venice Biennale. Despite her success, she withdrew from the art world in the 1970s and shifted her focus to therapy and helping others through art.

Clark's work was particularly influential in this movement, as she explored the ways in which art could be interactive and engage the body.In addition to her artistic pursuits, Clark was a committed political activist and was involved with left-wing movements throughout her life. She drew connections between her art and social justice issues, creating works that challenged dominant power structures and offered new possibilities for individual and collective agency.Clark's legacy as an artist and thinker continues to influence contemporary art and psychotherapy practices today. Her innovative approaches to art-making and therapy have inspired a generation of artists and practitioners who continue to explore the intersections between creativity, embodiment, and social justice issues.</p><p></p><p>
