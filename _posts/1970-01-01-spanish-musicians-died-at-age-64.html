		also known as St. Ignatius of Loyola, Ignatius Loyola, Saint Ignatius of Loyola or Íñigo López de Loyola

	
was
a Spanish
hermit, priest, theologian and soldier.


					</p><p>He is best known as the founder of the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits, one of the most influential religious orders in the Catholic Church. Ignatius was born into a noble family and had a military career before he underwent a spiritual conversion, during which he wrote his famous Spiritual Exercises, which are still widely used by Catholics today. He founded the Jesuits in 1540, and they quickly gained a reputation for their missionary work, education, and strong allegiance to the pope. Ignatius was beatified in 1609 and canonized in 1622, and his feast day is celebrated on July 31.</p><p>Despite being born to a noble family, Ignatius' early life was marked by gambling, brawling and womanizing. It was during his recovery from a battle injury that he started reading religious texts, which eventually led to his conversion. After founding the Jesuits, Ignatius sent missionaries to various parts of the world, including India, China, Japan and the Americas. He also played a key role in the counter-reformation, combating Protestantism and promoting Catholicism. Ignatius' writings and teachings had a significant impact on the spiritual and intellectual development of the Catholic Church, and his legacy continues to influence religious and secular organizations alike. The Jesuits he founded have been involved in various fields such as science, education, human rights, social justice, and interfaith dialogue.</p><p>As part of his military career, Ignatius was injured by a cannonball at the Battle of Pamplona in 1521, which forced him to undergo several surgeries and left him with a permanent limp. During his recovery, he experienced a profound spiritual awakening and decided to devote his life to God. He traveled to various parts of Europe, studying theology and working with the disadvantaged, before eventually settling in Rome and founding the Society of Jesus.</p><p>Ignatius' Spiritual Exercises, a set of meditations and prayers designed to help individuals deepen their relationship with God, became a cornerstone of the Jesuit tradition and remain widely used today. Another important aspect of Ignatius' legacy is his emphasis on education and intellectual inquiry. He believed that education was essential for the growth and development of individuals and societies, and the Jesuits have been involved in education for centuries, founding numerous schools and universities around the world.</p><p>In addition to his missionary work and role in the counter-reformation, Ignatius was also a prolific writer, penning numerous letters, treatises, and other works. He was known for his humility, compassion, and commitment to social justice, and his teachings continue to inspire many people today.</p><p>Ignatius' influence extends beyond the Catholic Church, with his teachings and methods inspiring movements such as Ignatian spirituality and Jesuit education. He is also regarded as a pioneer in the field of psychology, particularly in the area of psychotherapy, with his Spiritual Exercises considered a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Some of his other key works include his Autobiography, which offers insights into his personal journey of faith, and his Constitutions, which outline the structure and principles of the Jesuit order.</p><p>During his lifetime, Ignatius faced numerous challenges and opposition, including from the Inquisition, but he remained steadfast in his commitment to his faith and his work. His enduring legacy as a compassionate, innovative and visionary leader has made him one of the most revered figures in the history of the Catholic Church and beyond.</p><p></p><p>

artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the leading artists of the Spanish Baroque period and is best known for his exquisitely rendered religious paintings that often depicted children in a naturalistic and charming way. Murillo began his artistic training as a teenager in Seville, where he was born and raised, and his early works were heavily influenced by the dramatic chiaroscuro style of Caravaggio.</p><p>Throughout his career, Murillo received numerous commissions from churches and wealthy patrons, both in Spain and abroad. His most famous works include "The Immaculate Conception of El Escorial," "The Birth of the Virgin," and "The Charity of Saint Thomas of Villanueva," all of which emphasize the artist's exceptional talent for capturing emotionally resonant scenes with exquisite skill.</p><p>Murillo was also known for his innovative use of color and light, his ability to create a sense of depth and three-dimensionality, and his emphasis on realistic detail. Despite his success, Murillo was known to have a gentle and humble personality, and he was widely respected as a talented and dedicated artist. He died in Seville at the age of 64, leaving behind an impressive legacy that continues to inspire and captivate viewers all around the world to this day.</p><p>Murillo's work had a significant impact beyond his time, as he influenced many artists throughout Europe and the Americas, and his style became a defining characteristic of Spanish Baroque painting. His works have been exhibited in prestigious museums and galleries, including the Louvre in Paris and the National Gallery in London, and his legacy can be seen in the works of many artists, including Francisco de Goya and Pablo Picasso. Despite the acclaim he received during his lifetime, Murillo's reputation waned in the 18th and 19th centuries, as the tastes of art patrons shifted towards the more ornate and grandiose styles of Rococo and Neoclassicism. However, in recent years, there has been a renewed appreciation for Murillo's works, and he is recognized once again as one of the most important artists in Spanish history.</p><p>Murillo was born into a large family and was the youngest of fourteen children. His father was a barber and a surgeon, and his mother was originally from Portugal. Despite his humble origins, Murillo showed a natural talent for art from a young age, and he began his artistic apprenticeship at the age of eleven. </p><p>Murillo's early work reflected the influence of Caravaggio and the Italian Baroque style, but he soon developed his own unique style that focused on religious and domestic scenes. He became known for his ability to capture the emotion and humanity of his subjects, particularly children. </p><p>In addition to his paintings, Murillo was also known for his charitable work. He was a member of the Seville Brotherhood of Charity and worked to help the poor and disadvantaged through his art. He founded a free school for poor children and encouraged other artists to contribute to the project. </p><p>Despite his success, Murillo faced several challenges in his personal life. He lost his first wife and their five children to illness, and he struggled financially at various times throughout his career. However, he continued to produce exceptional works of art until his death in 1682. </p><p>Today, Murillo is celebrated as a master of Spanish Baroque art and an important figure in the history of Western art. His paintings are admired for their beauty, emotional intensity, and technical skill, and his influence can be felt in the works of countless artists who followed in his footsteps.</p><p>Murillo's impact on religious art cannot be overstated. He broke away from the traditional style of depicting holy figures as otherworldly and divine, instead bringing them closer to human nature. His use of light and color was groundbreaking, with his subjects often drenched in warm hues and natural light. Murillo was also a master of depicting textures, from the softness of a child's hair to the roughness of a beggar's clothing. He was able to convey a range of emotions in his paintings, from joy to sorrow, mercy to poverty. </p><p>Murillo's contributions to art were not just limited to his paintings. He was also a successful entrepreneur, establishing a workshop that produced works for both local and international clients. His workshop was known for producing high-quality reproductions of his paintings, allowing the masses to enjoy his works even if they couldn't afford the originals. </p><p>Today, Murillo continues to be revered by artists and art enthusiasts alike. His paintings are still studied and admired, and his influence can be seen in contemporary art. Despite his fame and success, Murillo never lost his humility or his dedication to his craft, which only adds to his reputation as one of the greatest artists of all time.</p><p></p><p>
