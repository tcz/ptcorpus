(October 1, 1729-December 23, 1777			Salzburg)


was
a German
, .


					</p><p>composer and musician who worked in Salzburg during the classical era. He was a student of Leopold Mozart, the father of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and became a close friend of the Mozart family. Adlgasser served as a court musician for Prince-Archbishop Schrattenbach and later for Archbishop Hieronymus von Colloredo. He composed a number of works for the Salzburg court, including operas, sacred music, and symphonies. Adlgasser is perhaps best known for his collaboration with Mozart on the composition of the opera "Ascanio in Alba" in 1771. Despite his relatively short life, Adlgasser left behind a significant body of work that contributed to the musical legacy of Salzburg during the 18th century.</p><p>In addition to his work as a court musician and composer, Anton Cajetan Adlgasser was also an accomplished singer and choir director. He served as the choir director for several Salzburg churches, including the Church of St. Michael and the Salzburg Cathedral. Adlgasser's music was well-regarded in his time and he was known for his skillful use of counterpoint and his melodic inventiveness. His compositions were widely performed in Salzburg and other parts of Europe during the late 18th century. Although Adlgasser's works were somewhat overshadowed by the music of Mozart and other famous composers of the era, his contributions to the musical landscape of Salzburg remain significant to this day.</p><p>One of Adlgasser's most notable works was his collaboration with Michael Haydn, brother of Joseph Haydn and friend of the Mozart family, on the composition of the oratorio "The Seven Words of Christ on the Cross". Adlgasser also wrote a number of operas, including "La Sparizione" and "Il sogno di Scipione", as well as several masses and other pieces of sacred music. He was praised for his ability to integrate traditional liturgical styles with the emerging classical style of his time. Adlgasser also mentored several young composers, including Johann Nepomuk Hummel, who would go on to become a famous composer in his own right. After Adlgasser's death at the age of 48, his music fell into obscurity, but has been rediscovered and recorded in recent years, helping to cement his place in the history of classical music.</p><p>In addition to his musical talents, Anton Cajetan Adlgasser was also known for his proficiency in languages. He mastered several languages, including Latin, Italian, French, and English, which aided him in setting liturgical texts and creating librettos for his operas. Adlgasser's dedication to his craft was evident in his meticulous approach to composition; he was known for revising his works extensively and seeking feedback from his peers in order to improve his compositions. Adlgasser's legacy lives on through his contributions to the development of classical music, and his influence on the Mozart family remains a testament to his skill and talent as a musician and composer.</p><p>Despite his close association with the Mozart family and his own accomplishments, Adlgasser's life and work have been somewhat overshadowed by those of his more famous contemporaries. However, he is now recognized as an important figure in the development of classical music in Salzburg and beyond. In addition to his musical career, Adlgasser was also a devoted family man, and he and his wife had seven children together. Adlgasser's descendants include several notable musicians, including the composer and conductor Franz Xaver Süßmayr, who completed Mozart's unfinished Requiem. Today, Adlgasser is remembered as a talented composer and musician who made significant contributions to the musical culture of Salzburg during the 18th century, and whose influence can still be felt in the works of later composers.</p><p></p><p>
