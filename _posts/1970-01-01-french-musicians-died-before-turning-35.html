(August 6, 1715		Aix-en-Provence-May 28, 1747			Paris)


was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues was a French essayist, moralist, and aphorist. Born in Aix-en-Provence to a noble family, Vauvenargues began his military career at a young age, but was forced to leave due to an injury. He turned to writing and became known for his insightful observations on human nature and his philosophical views.</p><p>Vauvenargues is perhaps best known for his work "Reflections and Maxims," a collection of philosophical aphorisms that touch on topics such as friendship, morality, and the human condition. This work was highly admired by some of the great thinkers of his time, including Voltaire and Montesquieu.</p><p>Despite his short life, Vauvenargues made a significant impact on French literature and philosophy. His writing style, which was both concise and profound, influenced many later writers and thinkers. Vauvenargues' ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars and philosophers today.</p><p>After leaving the military, Vauvenargues quickly gained a reputation as a man of letters and associated with some of the leading writers of his time, including Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He also formed a close friendship with the philosopher and mathematician, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, who later edited and published Vauvenargues' works after his death. In addition to his philosophical writings, Vauvenargues also wrote a play called "The Marquis of Pontcalé," which was performed at the Comédie-Française in 1745. Unfortunately, Vauvenargues' health was never robust, and he died at the young age of 31 from tuberculosis. Despite his relatively short career as a writer, Vauvenargues remains a significant figure in French literary and philosophical history.</p><p>Vauvenargues was known for his introspective and reflective nature, and his writing often delved into the complexities of the human psyche. His observations on the nature of human beings and their motivations were insightful and continue to be relevant today. Vauvenargues' work also reflected his political beliefs, which were rooted in a belief in individual liberty and reason. </p><p>One of Vauvenargues' most famous quotes is "The greatest achievement of genius is simplicity." This idea speaks to his belief in the power of concise and direct language, and his belief that ideas should be expressed in a clear and straightforward manner. </p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Vauvenargues' impact on French literature and philosophy was significant. His work inspired many later writers and thinkers, and his ideas continue to be studied and debated today. With his unique insights into the human psyche and his emphasis on simplicity and clarity in writing, Vauvenargues made a lasting contribution to the intellectual heritage of France.</p><p></p><p>

(December 2, 1859		Paris-March 29, 1891			Paris)

	
		a.k.a. Georges Seurat or Georges-Pierre Seurat

	
was
a French
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering work in the field of Neo-Impressionism, which sought to guide art towards a more scientific, objective approach. Seurat is renowned for his meticulous technique of pointillism, in which he created images consisting of tiny, individual dots of color that combine to form coherent visual works. Seurat's most famous painting, "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte," is a testament to his mastery of pointillism and his ability to capture the essence of modern life. In addition to painting, Seurat was also a talented draftsman and printmaker, and he created a number of works in these mediums during his short career. Despite his early death at the age of 31, Seurat left a lasting legacy on the world of art, inspiring subsequent generations of artists and influencing the development of modern art in the 20th century.</p><p>Born into a well-to-do family, Seurat displayed a love for art from a young age. He attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he studied under renowned painter Henri Lehmann. However, Seurat was dissatisfied with the traditional techniques of his instructors and began developing his own style, incorporating elements of Impressionism and Pointillism.</p><p>In 1884, Seurat founded the Société des Artistes Indépendants, a group dedicated to exhibiting the work of emerging artists who were rejected by the official Paris Salon. It was through this organization that Seurat's work gained critical attention, culminating in a solo exhibition in 1888.</p><p>Seurat's work was revolutionary for his time, as he sought to break from tradition and create a new visual language. He applied scientific principles to his art, studying color theory and the psychological effects of color on the human eye. His paintings often depicted everyday life in Paris, with a focus on the working-class and leisure activities. </p><p>Tragically, Seurat died at the young age of 31 from a rare form of meningitis. However, his influence lived on through subsequent generations of artists who were inspired by his techniques and his contributions to the development of modern art.</p><p>One of Seurat's early notable works was the painting "Bathers at Asnières" which was exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 1884. Despite its rejection from the official Paris Salon, the painting received critical acclaim and remains one of Seurat's most recognized works. He continued to produce innovative pieces, such as "The Circus," which displayed his interest in color theory by juxtaposing complementary colors in a single painting.</p><p>Seurat also created a number of technical pieces, including his Conté crayon drawings and lithographs. His fascination with color and light led him to develop a system of color theory that attributed emotional and psychological significance to different hues. This approach influenced other artists, such as Vincent van Gogh and Paul Signac.</p><p>Seurat's legacy continued to affect art movements throughout the 20th century, particularly in the field of abstract art. His use of pointillism and focus on the scientific principles of color theory were influential in the development of Neo-Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and even the Pointillist movement in America. Today, his works can be found in major museums and collections around the world, and his contributions to the evolution of modern art continue to be studied and admired.</p><p></p><p>

(February 3, 1909		Paris-August 24, 1943			Ashford)

	
		also known as Red virgin or The Martian

	
was
a French
philosopher, teacher, political activist and writer.


					</p><p>Simone Weil was born to a Jewish family in Paris and was known for her strong social and political beliefs. She was a teacher of philosophy at various institutions and was actively involved in political activism, particularly in the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II. Weil's writings focus on topics such as suffering, poverty and the human condition, and her most notable works include "Gravity and Grace" and "The Need for Roots." She also had a strong interest in religious and spiritual issues and explored Christianity, as well as other religious traditions, throughout her life. Despite her many accomplishments, Weil struggled with mental health issues and died at the young age of 34 while living in exile in England. Today, she is widely regarded as a leading philosopher of the 20th century and her work continues to influence scholars and activists around the world.</p><p>Weil's political activism began during her time at the École Normale Supérieure, where she became involved in left-wing politics and joined the French Communist Party. However, she soon became disillusioned with the party and left to join the Trotskyist movement. Weil's experiences in the Spanish Civil War only strengthened her convictions and she later joined the French Resistance during World War II, working as a factory laborer and eventually serving as a member of the Free French Air Force.</p><p>Weil's writings were diverse and covered a range of topics. In addition to her philosophical works, she also wrote articles and essays on political and social issues. One notable example was her essay "The Iliad, or the Poem of Force," which explored the relationship between power and violence. Weil was also a prolific letter-writer and her correspondence with various intellectuals, including Albert Camus, has been published.</p><p>Despite her Jewish background, Weil was drawn to Christianity and even considered becoming a Christian mystic. She believed that Christianity offered a unique perspective on suffering and the human condition, and her exploration of Christian theology and mysticism greatly influenced her later writings.</p><p>Today, Weil's work continues to be studied and celebrated by scholars and activists alike. Her ideas on empathy and compassion, as well as her critiques of power and violence, continue to resonate with people around the world.</p><p>Throughout her life, Simone Weil was known for her staunch refusal to compromise on her principles. She lived an ascetic lifestyle, often going without food or sleep so that she could better understand the struggles of the poor and marginalized. She saw her own suffering as a way of connecting with others who were similarly marginalized or oppressed. This deep empathy and compassion for others is a central theme of her work.</p><p>Weil's influence on 20th century philosophy cannot be overstated. Albert Camus, who corresponded with Weil for a time, once said that she "might well be the patron saint of all outsiders." Weil's ideas on the interconnectedness of all living beings and her belief in the importance of empathy and compassion continue to inspire people today. Her work on the relationship between power and violence has been especially influential, with many activists and scholars drawing on her insights to better understand the dynamics of oppression and resistance in modern society.</p><p></p><p>

lawyer, politician and botanist.


					</p><p>Chaumette was a prominent figure in the French Revolution and was known for his radical views. He was a member of the Cordeliers Club, which was known for its extreme left-wing politics. Chaumette became a leading figure in the movement and played a key role in the overthrow of King Louis XVI.</p><p>During the Revolution, Chaumette was appointed as the first mayor of Paris and he played a significant role in establishing the Revolutionary Tribunal. However, as the Reign of Terror gained momentum, Chaumette fell out of favor with the leaders of the Revolution.</p><p>In 1794, he was accused of being involved in a plot to overthrow the government and was arrested. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by guillotine. Chaumette's death was seen as a betrayal by some of his former supporters, who had once viewed him as a hero of the Revolution. Despite this, he remains a controversial figure in French history.</p><p>Chaumette was born into a family of lawyers and was trained in law himself. He had a passion for botany and often spent time studying plants and fossils. He wrote several papers on botany, one of which earned him a prize from the French Academy of Sciences.</p><p>In addition to his political and botanical pursuits, Chaumette was also a skilled orator and writer. He frequently spoke out against the monarchy and the aristocracy, advocating for the rights of common people. He was a proponent of secularism and believed that religion should play no role in government.</p><p>Despite his initial successes during the Revolution, Chaumette's radical views ultimately led to his downfall. He was accused of promoting atheism and was arrested along with other members of the Cordeliers Club. He was tried and found guilty, along with his wife, who was also a prominent figure in the Revolution.</p><p>Chaumette's execution was met with mixed reactions. Some saw him as a traitor to the Revolution, while others viewed him as a martyr for his uncompromising beliefs. Today, he is remembered as a controversial figure in French history who played a significant role in the Revolution.</p><p>In addition to his political and botanical pursuits, Chaumette was also known for his personal life. He had a reputation as a womanizer and had a number of affairs, including with the artist Constance-Marie Charpentier. He was also married twice, and his second wife was the revolutionary and feminist activist Claire Lacombe. Together, Chaumette and Lacombe were instrumental in creating the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, which sought to give greater political rights and protections to women in France.</p><p>Chaumette's radical views and involvement in the Reign of Terror have made him a controversial figure in French history. While some see him as a champion of the Revolution's ideals, others view him as a violent extremist who helped usher in a period of chaos and bloodshed. Regardless of one's perspective, there is no denying that Chaumette played a significant role in shaping France's political landscape during a pivotal period in its history.</p><p></p><p>

a French
lawyer.


					</p><p>Desmoulins was a key figure in the French Revolution and a fervent supporter of the Jacobin movement. He became famous for his fiery oratory and was a close friend of revolutionaries such as Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton. Desmoulins played a significant role in inciting the storming of the Bastille in 1789, which marked the beginning of the revolution. He was also a prolific journalist and writer, contributing to various newspapers and publishing several works on politics and literature. Despite his contributions to the revolution, Desmoulins fell out of favor with Robespierre, who accused him of being a counter-revolutionary.

He was a prolific letter writer and maintained a wide network of correspondents throughout his life. Desmoulins was married to Lucile Duplessis, whom he had met while studying in Paris.

Lucile was also known for her political activism and was executed alongside her husband.Despite his radical views and contributions to the revolution, Desmoulins' legacy has been somewhat controversial over time. Some have criticized his fiery rhetoric and accused him of inciting violence and extremism.

Buzot was a fierce critic of the radical faction led by Maximilien Robespierre and opposed the Reign of Terror.</p><p>In 1793, Buzot was elected to the National Convention, France's first elected legislature. He quickly emerged as a leader of the Girondins and advocated for a federalist system in which the power would be shared between central and local authorities.

For several months, he lived in secret in various locations in France, aided by sympathizers who shared his views.

was
a French
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>Klein was known for his unique style of art which was heavily influenced by his interest in spirituality and mysticism. He placed a great emphasis on the color blue, which he believed symbolized the infinite and the immaterial.

Klein's work has been exhibited around the world and he is considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. He was also a judo master and incorporated elements of martial arts into some of his performances.</p><p>Klein's interest in the concept of immateriality led him to develop a series of works known as "The Void" or "Le Vide," which consisted of empty gallery spaces that were painted entirely in IKB. He believed that this created a space where viewers could experience a sense of the infinite. </p><p>In addition to his work as an artist, Klein was also an influential figure in the development of performance art, and he frequently staged public actions and spectacles. One of his most famous works in this vein is "Anthropometries," in which nude models covered in IKB paint created imprints of their bodies on large sheets of paper, creating a kind of living painting.</p><p>Klein was greatly influenced by the work of the philosopher and mystic G.I. Gurdjieff, and he believed that art had the power to connect individuals with a higher spiritual reality. His work is characterized by a deep sense of spirituality and a desire to transcend the material world.</p><p>Klein's legacy has had a profound impact on the world of contemporary art, and his work continues to inspire and influence artists today. He is widely regarded as a pioneer of post-war European art, and his innovative use of color and form have made him one of the most important artists of the 20th century.</p><p>Klein's family was heavily involved in the art world, with his father being a well-known figurative painter and his grandfather owning a gallery in Nice. Klein was trained as a judo master and even opened his own dojo in Paris, where he trained with other famous artists such as Arman, Jean Tinguely, and Martial Raysse. He also briefly studied at the École Nationale Supérieure de la Photographie in Paris. </p><p>After developing his signature color and style, Klein gained notoriety in the art world with his first solo exhibition in Paris in 1957, titled "Yves: Propositions Monochromes," which featured a series of his works painted solely in IKB. In 1958, he exhibited his work in the United States and later traveled to Japan to further his understanding of Eastern spirituality.</p><p>In addition to his artwork and performance art pieces, Klein also wrote extensively on topics related to art and spirituality. He published two books, "Yves Klein: Le dépassement de la problématique de l'art" and "Les Fondements du Judo," the latter of which explored the philosophical and spiritual principles of the martial art.</p><p>Klein's work has been exhibited in major museums and galleries around the world, including the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Tate Modern in London. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of artists and his unique style and contributions to the world of contemporary art remain highly influential.</p><p></p><p>

a French
philosopher.


					</p><p>La Boétie was a close friend and associate of the famous essayist Michel de Montaigne, and his works had a profound influence on Montaigne's writing. His most famous work, "The Discourse on Voluntary Servitude," explores the concept of political power and the ways in which people become complicit in their own oppression. He was also a prominent magistrate in Bordeaux, serving as a judge and a member of the city's parliament. Despite his short life, La Boétie's ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars around the world.</p><p>In addition to his philosophical and political writings, Étienne de La Boétie was also a talented poet.

La Boétie was a prodigious intellect from a young age, and he excelled in his studies at the University of Orléans. He was a fluent speaker of Latin and Greek, and was well-versed in the classics of both ancient Rome and Greece. Despite his many accomplishments, La Boétie's life was cut tragically short when he died at the age of just 32 from what is believed to have been dysentery. Nevertheless, his legacy as a political thinker, philosopher, and poet continues to inspire and challenge scholars to this day.</p><p>La Boétie was born into a noble family and was educated in law, but he demonstrated a strong affinity for the humanities and the classics. He was also a member of the group of poets and scholars known as the Pléiade, which sought to elevate French literature and make it on par with the great works of ancient Greece and Rome. Despite his privileged background, La Boétie was deeply committed to the principles of freedom and democracy, and he believed that all people were equal and should have the right to govern themselves.</p><p>In addition to his philosophical and literary works, La Boétie was also a devoted friend and mentor to Montaigne. The two men spent endless hours discussing their ideas and debating the most pressing issues of their day. When La Boétie became ill, Montaigne traveled to Bordeaux to be by his side and care for him during his final days. After La Boétie's death, Montaigne honored his friend's memory by including a long essay on him in his "Essays," in which he praised La Boétie's intellect, wit, and bravery.</p><p>Today, La Boétie's ideas remain as relevant as ever, and his writings continue to inspire political thinkers, activists, and scholars around the world. His belief in the power of individuals to resist tyranny and oppression and his call for people to exercise their freedom and assert their rights as citizens continue to resonate with people of all backgrounds and cultures.</p><p></p><p>

(September 26, 1791		Rouen-January 26, 1824			Paris)

	
		otherwise known as Theodore Gericault or Géricault, Théodore

	
was
a French
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is considered one of the pioneers of the Romantic movement in French art and is best known for his series of paintings called "The Raft of the Medusa." Géricault was also known for his portraits and equestrian paintings. Despite dying at a young age of 32, his work had a significant influence on later artists and movements, including the Impressionists. Géricault was also a trained anatomist and often studied anatomy as part of his artistic education, resulting in a heightened realism in his work.</p><p>Géricault was born into an affluent family, his father being a lawyer and his mother a daughter of a wealthy shipowner. Growing up, Géricault developed a passion for horses which he later integrated into his art, often painting them with great detail and accuracy. He studied under the neoclassical painter Carle Vernet and later under Pierre-Narcisse Guérin, where he learned the techniques of oil painting and classical art. Despite his success as an artist, Géricault suffered from mental health issues and often struggled with depression which was reflected in his work. He also had a turbulent personal life and had affairs with married women. Géricault's pioneering approach to art and his tragic life has made him a figure of fascination for art historians, with his works continuing to inspire and captivate audiences to this day.</p><p>Géricault's most famous work, "The Raft of the Medusa," was inspired by a real-life event in which a French ship ran aground off the coast of Africa in 1816, resulting in the deaths of most of the passengers and crew. The painting depicts the survivors of the shipwreck huddled together on a makeshift raft, with some resorting to cannibalism in order to survive. Géricault's powerful portrayal of the human suffering and resilience in the face of adversity made the painting an instant sensation and a symbol of political and social commentary.  </p><p>In addition to his art, Géricault was also interested in other areas such as archaeology and horse racing. He commissioned a life-size plaster model of the famous Borghese Gladiator statue, which he used as a reference for his paintings. He also owned several racehorses, which he trained himself and raced in local competitions.</p><p>Géricault's legacy can be seen in the works of many artists who followed him, including Eugène Delacroix, Edouard Manet, and Vincent van Gogh.

a French
mountain guide and mountaineer.


					</p><p>Louis Lachenal was a renowned mountaineer who is best known for being a part of the first successful ascent of Annapurna, the tenth highest mountain in the world. Along with his partner Maurice Herzog, Lachenal climbed the mountain in 1950, which was a groundbreaking achievement in the mountaineering world at that time. Lachenal was also an accomplished skier, having won the French skiing championship in 1945. However, his life was tragically cut short in 1955 when he died in a skiing accident in Chamonix. Despite his short life, Louis Lachenal's contribution to mountaineering remains significant to this day.</p><p>Lachenal was born in Annecy, France, in 1921, and he developed a love for the mountains from an early age. He began his career as a mountain guide at the young age of 18, and quickly became known for his exceptional climbing abilities. In 1949, Lachenal was recruited to be a part of the French Annapurna expedition, a daunting task given that no one had ever successfully climbed a peak over 8,000 meters. </p><p>Despite numerous setbacks, including severe altitude sickness and frostbite, Lachenal and Herzog reached the summit of Annapurna on June 3, 1950, becoming the first people to ever stand on top of a peak over 8,000 meters. The historic achievement made Lachenal a national hero in France, and he went on to write a best-selling book about the expedition entitled Annapurna: Première 8 000. </p><p>Tragically, Lachenal's life was cut short just five years later in a skiing accident in Chamonix. Despite his untimely death, his contributions to mountaineering are still remembered and celebrated today. In addition to his pioneering ascent of Annapurna, Lachenal also made numerous other notable climbs throughout his career, including the first ascent of the north ridge of Aiguille du Peigne in the French Alps. His legacy lives on as a testament to the courage, determination, and love of the mountains that drove him throughout his life.</p><p>In addition to his mountaineering achievements, Louis Lachenal was also a skilled skier. He began skiing as a child and quickly developed a talent for the sport, winning the French skiing championship in 1945. Lachenal continued to compete in skiing events throughout his life and even considered pursuing a career as a professional skier before turning his attention to mountaineering.</p><p>Lachenal's success on the slopes translated well to his climbing abilities, as he possessed an uncanny sense of balance and unparalleled technique. His unique blend of skills helped him become one of the top climbers of his time, known for his daring ascents and fearless approach to mountaineering.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Lachenal was known for his humility and willingness to help others. He was always willing to share his knowledge and expertise with fellow climbers, becoming a mentor and friend to many within the climbing community. His passion for the mountains and his unwavering dedication to his craft continue to inspire climbers around the world to this day.</p><p></p><p>
