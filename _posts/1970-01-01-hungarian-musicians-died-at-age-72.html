									</h1><p>Here are 19 famous musicians from Hungary died at 72:</p><h2>Roland Wank</h2><p><strong>Roland Wank</strong>
(April 5, 1898-April 5, 1970)


was
a Hungarian
architect.


					</p><p>He is best known for his eclectic style that combined traditional Hungarian folk designs with functionality and modernism. Wank was born in Budapest and studied architecture at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. In the 1920s, he worked for the prominent Hungarian architect Ödön Lechner, who is considered the father of Hungarian Art Nouveau.</p><p>Wank's architectural style was heavily influenced by Lechner's work, as well as by the traditional Hungarian motifs and peasant crafts. He believed that architecture should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also functional and serve the needs of its inhabitants. Wank's designs included private homes, apartment buildings, schools, and public buildings.</p><p>In the 1930s, he became the chief architect of the Hungarian Ministry of Education and Culture, where he designed several schools and cultural centers. During World War II, Wank worked on the reconstruction of Budapest, which was heavily damaged by the bombings. After the war, he continued to work on various architectural projects and played an important role in the post-war reconstruction of Hungary.</p><p>Wank was also a professor of architecture at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics and wrote several books on Hungarian architecture and design. His most famous work, the Budapest Bauhaus, is still considered a masterpiece of Hungarian modernist architecture. Wank died on his 72nd birthday in Budapest, leaving behind an impressive legacy and influencing generations of Hungarian architects.</p><p>In addition to his architectural works, Roland Wank was also a talented painter and graphic designer. He often incorporated his own artwork into his architectural designs, creating a cohesive and artistic space. Wank was also an active member of the Hungarian National Association of Applied Arts and taught courses on art and design. </p><p>Despite his success and influence in Hungarian architecture, Wank's work fell out of favor during the Soviet era, as the government preferred a more utilitarian and Communist style of architecture. However, in recent years, there has been a renewed interest in Wank's work and his designs have been celebrated for their innovative and artistic approach. Today, several of Wank's buildings have been preserved as historic landmarks and are cherished for their unique blend of traditional Hungarian motifs and modernist style.</p><p></p><p>
