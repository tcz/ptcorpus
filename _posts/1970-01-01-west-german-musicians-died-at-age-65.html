		a.k.a. Theodor Friedrich Emil Janenz

	
was
a West German
actor, film producer and film art director.


					</p><p>Emil Jannings was renowned for his versatile acting skills and is considered to be one of the greatest actors of the silent film era. He appeared in over 100 films and worked with renowned directors such as F.W. Murnau and Josef von Sternberg. Jannings won the first-ever Academy Award for Best Actor in 1929 for his role in the films "The Way of All Flesh" and "The Last Command". However, his career was greatly affected by his close association with the Nazi regime and he was shunned by the film industry after World War II. Despite this, Jannings remains a celebrated figure in the history of German cinema.</p><p>Jannings started his acting career as a theater actor before making his film debut in 1914. He quickly became a popular figure in German cinema, playing diverse roles ranging from the heroic to the villainous. He excelled in portraying complex characters, and his performances were praised for their emotional depth and authenticity. </p><p>In addition to his acting, Jannings was also a film producer and art director. He co-founded a film production company, Parufamet, in 1925 and produced several successful films, including "Variety", directed by E.A. Dupont. However, with the rise of the Nazi party, Jannings became an ardent supporter of the regime and made several propaganda films for them. As a result, he was accused of being a Nazi collaborator after the war, and his films were banned in many countries. </p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his personal life, Jannings' contributions to the film industry are widely recognized. His performances in classic films like "The Last Laugh" and "Faust" continue to inspire actors and filmmakers today. Some of his famous co-stars include Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, and Louise Brooks.</p><p></p><p>
