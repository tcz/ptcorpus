						</p><p>Begin was a prominent figure in Israeli politics, serving as the 6th Prime Minister of Israel from 1977 to 1983. He was the founder of the right-wing political party, Likud, and is credited with being a key figure in the development and implementation of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p><p>Prior to his political career, Begin was a leader in the Jewish underground in pre-state Palestine and played a prominent role in the Zionist movement. He was also a survivor of the Holocaust, having spent time in several concentration camps during World War II.</p><p>Begin was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978, along with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, for their efforts to negotiate a peace settlement between Israel and Egypt. However, his legacy continues to be a subject of debate, with some viewing him as a hero for his role in the establishment and defense of Israel, while others criticize him for his hard-line stance on issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p><p>Begin was born in Brest-Litovsk, in what is now Belarus, and grew up in a Polish-Jewish family. He received a law degree from the University of Warsaw and became involved in Zionist activities while still a student. After the outbreak of World War II, he was arrested and imprisoned by Soviet authorities for two years before being released and joining the Polish army in exile. After the war, he emigrated to Palestine and became involved in the militant Zionist movement, eventually rising to become the leader of the Irgun, a paramilitary organization that carried out attacks against British targets in Palestine.</p><p>In 1948, Begin became a member of the Israeli Knesset, or parliament, and later served as a cabinet minister in various governments before being elected prime minister in 1977. One of his most significant achievements as prime minister was the signing of the Camp David Accords with Egypt in 1978, which led to the first peace agreement between Israel and an Arab country.</p><p>Begin resigned as prime minister in 1983 and retired from politics, but remained an influential figure in Israeli society until his death in 1992. Today, he is remembered as a complex and controversial figure who played a central role in shaping the course of Israeli history.</p><p>Despite being awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize, Begin was often criticized for his hard-line stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His policies, including the construction of settlements in disputed territories, were seen by many as an obstacle to peace in the region. However, Begin's supporters viewed him as a hero for his unwavering commitment to Israeli security, and for his efforts to ensure the survival and prosperity of the Jewish state.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Begin was also a prolific author and historian. He wrote several books, including "The Revolt" and "White Nights: The Story of a Prisoner in Russia," which drew on his experiences as a leader in the Jewish underground and as a Holocaust survivor. He was also a vocal advocate for human rights, and spoke out against Soviet repression of dissenters and dissidents during the Cold War.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his legacy, Menachem Begin is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential figures in Israeli history. His leadership helped shape the character and direction of the Jewish state, and his commitment to Israeli security and survival remains an enduring legacy.</p><p></p><p>
