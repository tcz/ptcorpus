						Jonathan Larson was best known for his creation of the rock musical Rent, which won a Pulitzer Prize for Drama and multiple Tony Awards. It was also adapted into a feature film. Before Rent, he wrote and composed many other musicals, but none of them were as well-received as Rent. Tragically, Larson died unexpectedly of an aortic dissection the night before the first preview performance of Rent's off-Broadway debut, never seeing the massive success the show would become. However, his impact on musical theater is still felt to this day, with many considering him to be one of the most influential forces in musical theater of the 20th century.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=296337" title="Wikipedia article about Jonathan Larson">Jonathan Larson on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/mexican-musicians-died-at-age-68.html' title='Mexican musicians died at age 68'><strong>Mexican musicians died at age 68</strong> List of the top 17 Mexican music stars who died when they were 68</a></li><li><a href='/turkish-musicians-died-at-age-46.html' title='Turkish musicians died at age 46'><strong>Turkish musicians died at age 46</strong> List of the top 2 Turkish music stars who died when they were 46</a></li><li><a href='/egyptian-musicians-died-at-age-74.html' title='Egyptian musicians died at age 74'><strong>Egyptian musicians died at age 74</strong> List of the top 7 Egyptian music stars who died when they were 74</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/english-musicians-died-in-liver-failure.html' title='English musicians died in Liver failure'><strong>English musicians died in Liver failure</strong> List of the top 1 English music stars who died in Liver failure</a></li><li><a href='/argentine-musicians-died-at-age-25.html' title='Argentine musicians died at age 25'><strong>Argentine musicians died at age 25</strong> List of the top 1 Argentine music stars who died when they were 25</a></li><li><a href='/american-musicians-died-in-firearm.html' title='American musicians died in Firearm'><strong>American musicians died in Firearm</strong> List of the top 17 American music stars who died in Firearm</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
