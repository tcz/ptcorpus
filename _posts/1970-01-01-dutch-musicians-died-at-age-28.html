In 2007, the foundation merged with the NAC Breda Youth Academy, forming the Nico Rijnders Academy, which has produced several successful players over the years.

In his first season with Feyenoord Rotterdam, Rijnders helped the team win the Eredivisie title in 1971, and he went on to win the KNVB Cup with the team in 1974.</p><p>Off the field, Rijnders was known for his friendly and outgoing personality.

(July 15, 1916		Willemstad-February 9, 1945			Dachau concentration camp)


was
a Dutch
personality.


					</p><p>He is best known for his heroism during World War II as a member of the Dutch resistance. Maduro was an officer in the Dutch army and was captured by the Germans in 1940. He managed to escape from prison and joined the resistance, using his military knowledge to help train other resistance fighters.</p><p>Maduro is also remembered for his role in the Battle of the Hague, where he and a small group of soldiers held off a much larger German force for several days, allowing the Dutch royal family to escape to England. For his bravery, he was awarded the highest Dutch military honor, the Militaire Willems-Orde.</p><p>After the war ended, Maduro's family established the Madurodam miniature park in The Hague as a tribute to him. Today, the park attracts millions of visitors each year and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Netherlands.</p><p>Maduro's heroism and determination to fight against oppression and injustice ultimately led to his arrest by the Gestapo in 1944. He was sent to the Dachau concentration camp where he died at the young age of 28, just a few months before the camp was liberated by the Allies. Maduro remains a symbol of courage and resistance against tyranny for people all over the world.</p><p>In addition to the miniature park, several other memorials have been dedicated to Maduro. In 1952, the Dutch government issued a stamp in his honor, and in 2014, a walking and cycling path in The Hague was named after him. His legacy continues to inspire new generations who seek to honor his memory by standing up for what is right and just.</p><p>Maduro was born in Willemstad, Curaçao, which was at that time a Dutch colony. He was the son of a Jewish mother and a father of Afro-Curaçaoan descent. Maduro's parents were prominent members of Curaçao's small Jewish community, and his mother served as a member of the island's council. Maduro was sent to the Netherlands to attend high school and then went on to study law at the University of Leiden. Eventually, he decided to pursue a military career and enrolled in officer training at the Dutch Military Academy. </p><p>After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, Maduro fought on the front lines with his unit, but they were quickly overwhelmed by the German army. He was taken captive, but he managed to escape from prison and flee to the Netherlands, where he joined the resistance. In addition to training other fighters, Maduro also participated in raids and sabotage missions against the German occupiers. </p><p>Maduro's bravery and willingness to risk his own life to rescue others made him a hero among his fellow resistance fighters. His most famous act of heroism came during the "Battle of the Hague," when he led a group of soldiers in a daring defense of the city against a much larger German force. Despite being vastly outnumbered and outgunned, they held out for several days, causing significant damage to the German army and allowing members of the Dutch royal family to escape to England. </p><p>Tragically, Maduro's heroism came at a great cost. In 1944, he was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Dachau concentration camp. He died there in February 1945, just a few months before the camp was liberated by Allied forces. Despite his untimely death, Maduro's legacy lives on as a symbol of courage and resistance against tyranny.</p><p></p><p>
