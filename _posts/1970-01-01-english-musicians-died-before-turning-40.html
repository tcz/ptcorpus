His daughter Alice went on to marry Edward Montagu, while his younger daughter Margaret married John Segrave, 4th Baron Segrave.

He discovered the basic process of removing phosphorus from iron ore, which was a major breakthrough in the production of high-quality steel. Thomas worked with his cousin Percy Gilchrist to develop the process, which was called the Thomas-Gilchrist process. The process involved the addition of a chemical called calcium carbide to the iron ore, which reacted with the phosphorus to form a solid slag that could be easily removed. </p><p>Thomas also patented an invention called the submerged arc furnace, which was used to produce calcium carbide. The furnace used an electric arc to heat the materials, resulting in a much more efficient and cost-effective production process. </p><p>Thomas was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and his contributions to the steel industry earned him numerous awards and accolades. Unfortunately, he died at a young age from tuberculosis, but his legacy lives on through his innovations and impact on the steel industry.</p><p>Sidney Gilchrist Thomas was born on April 16, 1850, in Canonbury, a district in Islington, London, UK.

Later, he went to study at the Royal School of Mines in London, where he gained a deeper understanding of metallurgy.</p><p>After completing his education, Thomas began his career as a metallurgist, working at various ironworks in the UK. In 1878, Thomas began working with his cousin, Percy Gilchrist, to develop a process for removing phosphorus from iron ore. At that time, the presence of phosphorus in iron ore made it unsuitable for steel production. Thomas and Gilchrist's process involved the addition of a chemical called calcium carbide to the iron ore, which reacted with the phosphorus to form a solid slag that could be easily removed.</p><p>The Thomas-Gilchrist process was a major breakthrough for the steel industry, and it significantly improved the quality of steel produced. The new process quickly became popular, and by the 1890s, it was widely used in the UK, Europe, and the United States. In addition to his work on the Thomas-Gilchrist process, Thomas also patented an invention called the submerged arc furnace. The furnace used an electric arc to heat the materials, resulting in a much more efficient and cost-effective production process.</p><p>Despite his achievements, Thomas's career was cut short by his premature death from tuberculosis in Paris on 1 February 1885, at the age of just thirty-four. He was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Although his life was short, his contributions to the steel industry had a lasting impact on modern technology and manufacturing.

Despite his close proximity to the royal court, Catesby remained committed to the Catholic faith and was known to be a staunch defender of Catholicism.</p><p>Catesby became increasingly frustrated with the persecution of Catholics under the reign of James I, who had issued harsh anti-Catholic laws.
