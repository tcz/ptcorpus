His contribution to Finnish cinema was recognized posthumously with the establishment of the Erkki Karu Prize, which is awarded annually to a prominent Finnish filmmaker.</p><p>Furthermore, Erkki Karu was not only a filmmaker, but also a businessman. He played a key role in the development of the Finnish film distribution network, creating a system of regional theaters that brought movies to audiences across the country.
