(April 5, 2015		Guatemala-April 5, 2015			Santiago de Cuba)


was
a Guatemalan
personality.


					</p><p>Actually, Mariano Paredes (January 7, 1797 - September 7, 1849) was a President of Mexico. Born in Valle de Allende, Chihuahua, he joined the military at a young age and was appointed as President of Mexico on July 4, 1846. His presidency was rather tumultuous, marked by political upheaval and social unrest. He was ousted in 1848 by a popular revolt led by the Mexican liberal faction. Despite his controversial presidency, Paredes remains a significant figure in Mexican history due to his involvement in the Mexican-American War and his attempts to modernize the country's military.</p><p>After being ousted from the presidency, Mariano Paredes went into exile to Cuba, where he spent the rest of his days. He had a military career spanning over three decades and served in various positions within the Mexican Army. Paredes was instrumental in the defeat of Texas during the Texas Revolution and later, in the Mexican-American War, he commanded the Mexican Army's operations in the north. Despite his military successes, his presidency was marred by corruption and authoritarianism, leading to his eventual downfall. Paredes' legacy continues to be debated by historians and political scholars.</p><p>During his time as President of Mexico, Paredes suspended the constitution and dissolved Congress, establishing a dictatorship in the country. He also sought to improve Mexico's economy by increasing taxes and reducing government spending. However, his policies were largely unpopular and contributed to the social and political unrest during his presidency.</p><p>Paredes' military background played a significant role in his political career. He was known as a skilled tactician and strategist, and his military experience gave him the support of many in the armed forces. His attempts to modernize the military, however, were met with resistance from traditionalists who opposed changes to the army's structure and tactics.</p><p>After his exile to Cuba, Paredes remained active in politics, attempting to launch a failed uprising against the Mexican government in 1851. He also worked as a military advisor to the Spanish colonial government in Cuba until his death.</p><p>Overall, Mariano Paredes' legacy in Mexican history remains complex and controversial. While he played a significant role in the country's military history and attempted to implement reforms during his presidency, his authoritarian rule and actions ultimately led to his downfall and tarnished his reputation.</p><p></p><p>
