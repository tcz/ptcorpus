(February 4, 1906		Wrocław-April 9, 1945			Flossenbürg)


was
a German
theologian, pastor and writer.


						</p><p>He is best known for his resistance against the Nazi regime during World War II, which ultimately led to his execution by hanging. Bonhoeffer was part of the Confessing Church, a movement within German Protestantism that opposed Hitler's attempt to centralize control of the church. He was involved in efforts to aid Jews and other oppressed groups, and eventually became involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler. Bonhoeffer's theological writings, which include "The Cost of Discipleship" and "Letters and Papers from Prison," continue to have a profound impact on Christian thought and practice today.</p><p>Bonhoeffer was born into a large family of intellectuals, with his father being a psychiatrist and professor of neurology. He studied theology in Berlin and was ordained as a Lutheran pastor in 1931. The rise of the Nazi party greatly troubled Bonhoeffer, and he quickly became involved in the Confessing Church, which was an underground movement of Christians dedicated to resisting Nazi control over the Church.</p><p>Bonhoeffer travelled to the United States in 1939 to teach at Union Theological Seminary in New York City, but he ultimately made the difficult decision to return to Germany and join the resistance movement against the Nazis. He was arrested in 1943 and imprisoned for two years, during which time he wrote extensively on Christian faith and persecution.</p><p>Bonhoeffer was ultimately executed on April 9, 1945, just weeks before the Allies liberated the camp where he was being held. His legacy lives on as a powerful example of Christian courage and resistance in the face of tyranny, and his theological writings continue to inspire people around the world.</p><p></p><p>

		a.k.a. Lord Haw Haw or Joyce, William

	
was
a German
politician.


						</p><p>William Joyce was not a German politician, he was a traitor to his own country, the United Kingdom. He became a prominent figure in Nazi propaganda during World War II, broadcasting anti-British messages on German radio under the nickname "Lord Haw Haw". Joyce was born in Brooklyn, New York, but moved to Ireland with his family as a child. He became active in far-right political groups in the UK during the 1930s and eventually fled to Germany after being charged with sedition. He was later captured by British forces and executed for treason. Joyce remains a controversial figure in British history, with some considering him a traitor and others arguing he was simply exercising free speech.</p><p>Despite being born in America, William Joyce considered himself to be English and was deeply involved in British politics before defecting to Germany during World War II. He was initially a member of the British Union of Fascists, a far-right political party led by Oswald Mosley. However, Joyce became disillusioned with Mosley and his party and established his own group called the National Socialist League. After fleeing to Germany, Joyce worked for the Nazi propaganda machine, delivering radio broadcasts to British audiences as "Lord Haw Haw." He used these broadcasts to make anti-Semitic and anti-British statements, as well as to spread misinformation about the war. After the war ended, Joyce was apprehended and returned to Britain to face charges of high treason. He was found guilty and hanged in 1946, the last person to be executed for treason in the United Kingdom. Joyce's legacy as a traitor and propagandist remains controversial to this day.</p><p></p><p>
