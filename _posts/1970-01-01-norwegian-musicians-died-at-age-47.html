(May 15, 1750		Risør-June 13, 1797			Akershus Fortress)


was
a Norwegian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a merchant, journalist, and patriot who played a significant role in the Norwegian independence movement in the late 18th century. Lofthuus was a vocal critic of the Danish-Norwegian government and used his newspaper, Norske Intelligenz-Seddeler, to advocate for Norwegian autonomy. He was a key figure in the constitutional assembly of 1786, where he argued for a written constitution to limit the power of the Danish-Norwegian monarchy. However, his political ideas led to his arrest and imprisonment in Akershus Fortress in 1794, where he remained until his death three years later. Despite his short life, Lofthuus left a lasting legacy as a champion of Norwegian independence and a symbol of resistance against foreign rule.</p><p>From a young age, Lofthuus was well-versed in the world of trade and commerce, having grown up in a family of merchants in the bustling coastal town of Risør. As a young adult, he studied commerce in Bergen and later took up residence in Copenhagen, where he became increasingly involved in the burgeoning Norwegian independence movement.</p><p>In addition to his political activities, Lofthuus was an influential journalist and prolific writer. His newspaper, Norske Intelligenz-Seddeler, was among the most widely read publications in Norway at the time and played a vital role in mobilizing public support for the independence movement.</p><p>Despite facing persecution and imprisonment for his beliefs, Lofthuus remained a steadfast advocate for Norwegian autonomy until his untimely death at the age of 47. He is remembered today as one of the foremost leaders of the Norwegian independence movement and a champion of democratic values and individual freedoms.</p><p>Lofthuus’ political activities often put him at odds with the Danish-Norwegian government, which sought to suppress any efforts to promote Norwegian independence. He was repeatedly arrested and charged with treason for his vocal criticism of government policies and his advocacy for greater autonomy. Despite the risks, Lofthuus continued to agitate for change, using his newspaper to call for a more democratic and representative government.</p><p>During his imprisonment in Akershus Fortress, Lofthuus continued to write and correspond with his supporters, earning him the admiration of many Norwegians who saw him as a symbol of resistance against foreign rule. His death in 1797 was mourned by many, and his legacy as a champion of Norwegian independence continued to inspire future generations of patriots.</p><p>Today, Lofthuus is recognized as one of Norway’s most important historical figures, whose contributions to the fight for independence helped pave the way for the country’s eventual separation from Denmark in 1814. His ideas about democracy and civic engagement continue to influence Norwegian politics and society, and his name remains synonymous with the struggle for individual freedoms and national sovereignty.</p><p></p><p>
