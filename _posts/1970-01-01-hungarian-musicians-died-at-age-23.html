In 1944, she and a small group of volunteers were sent on a mission to parachute into Nazi-occupied Hungary to rescue Jews who were being deported to extermination camps. Szenes was captured not long after her arrival and subjected to brutal interrogation and torture by the Gestapo.</p><p>Szenes' diaries, poetry, and letters were later discovered and published posthumously, and her story has been the subject of numerous books, films, and plays.
