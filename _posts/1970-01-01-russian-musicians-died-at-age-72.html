was
a Russian
engineer and physicist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on electrochemistry, particularly for inventing the first practical electric motor in 1834. He also made significant contributions to the development of the theory of galvanic cells and the electrochemical theory of corrosion. Later in his career, he played a key role in the development of Russia's Baltic Fleet and was instrumental in the construction of several fortifications along the Gulf of Finland.

(March 3, 1845		Saint Petersburg-January 6, 1918			Halle)


was
a Russian
mathematician and philosopher.


					</p><p>Cantor is known for his profound contributions to set theory, particularly the creation of transfinite numbers and the diagonal argument. Despite facing significant criticism during his lifetime, Cantor's work laid the foundation for modern mathematics and forever changed our understanding of the infinite. Away from his mathematical pursuits, Cantor was devoted to studying theology and even wrote works on the intersection of mathematics and faith. Towards the end of his life, Cantor suffered from mental health issues and was ultimately institutionalized until his death in 1918. Today, Cantor's pioneering work in set theory has made him one of the most celebrated mathematicians of all time.</p><p>Cantor was born into a family of Danish origin and spent his early years traveling due to his father's job as a successful merchant. From an early age, he showed a precocious talent for mathematics and was self-taught in the subject before receiving formal education at the University of Berlin. During his studies, Cantor was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as Bernhard Riemann and Richard Dedekind, whose theories on infinity inspired many of Cantor's own ideas. </p><p>One of Cantor's greatest contributions to mathematics was his development of a rigorous approach to infinity using set theory, which included the creation of transfinite numbers and the concept of a hierarchy of infinities. He also formulated a number of important theorems, such as the Cantor-Bernstein-Schroeder theorem, which describe the relationship between infinite sets.</p><p>Cantor's work, however, faced significant opposition from many of his contemporaries, who were deeply skeptical of his ideas on infinity and the unboundedness of mathematical objects. In particular, the mathematician Henri Poincaré was a vocal critic of Cantor's work and argued that his theories were contradictory and violated basic mathematical principles. Despite this criticism, Cantor continued to refine and develop his ideas until the end of his life.</p><p>Today, Cantor's legacy is celebrated throughout the mathematical community, and his contributions to set theory continue to influence modern mathematics, logic, and even computer science. Moreover, through his work, Cantor helped to reshape our understanding of the infinite and the nature of mathematical knowledge, leaving a lasting impact on the field for generations to come.</p><p></p><p>
