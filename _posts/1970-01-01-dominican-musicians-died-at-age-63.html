(January 26, 1813		Santo Domingo-July 15, 1876			Caracas)


was
a Dominican
writer, poet, philosopher, actor and soldier.


					</p><p>He is considered to be one of the founding fathers of the Dominican Republic and played a crucial role in its struggle for independence from Haiti. Duarte founded the secret society La Trinitaria, which worked to organize and plan for the overthrow of Haitian rule. He was also heavily involved in various conspiracies and uprisings, and spent much of his life in exile as a result. Despite his political activities, Duarte was also a noted poet and writer, and his works often dealt with themes of national identity, freedom, and justice. His legacy remains an important part of Dominican culture and history, and he is celebrated as a hero and patriot.</p><p>Duarte was born to a wealthy family in Santo Domingo, which was then a part of Haiti. He received his education in Venezuela and later returned to his homeland to work as a teacher. However, he was not content with the conditions under Haitian rule and began to actively work towards the independence of the Dominican Republic.</p><p>Duarte founded La Trinitaria in 1838 as a means of organizing a resistance movement against the Haitian government. The society's three founding members were Duarte, Francisco del Rosario Sánchez, and Matías Ramón Mella. Together, they planned the first uprising against Haitian rule in 1843, which was unsuccessful. However, their efforts eventually led to the declaration of the Dominican Republic's independence in 1844.</p><p>After independence, Duarte served briefly as the country's leader but was eventually exiled due to his radical political beliefs. He spent time in Venezuela, Colombia, and the United States before returning to the Dominican Republic in 1864 to lead another uprising against the government. However, this too was unsuccessful, and Duarte was again forced into exile.</p><p>Despite his many trials and setbacks, Duarte remained committed to the cause of independence and worked tirelessly throughout his life to achieve it. He is remembered as a true hero and patriot in the Dominican Republic, and his legacy continues to inspire the country's people to this day.</p><p>As a writer and poet, Duarte's literary works were greatly influenced by the Romanticism movement, which emphasized individualism, emotions, and nature. His most notable poems include "Mi inspiración" and "Los cien fuegos".</p><p>Aside from his political and literary pursuits, Duarte was also a theater actor and created several plays for his society La Trinitaria. His play, "La Dama Duende", was performed in 1844, just days after the declaration of independence.</p><p>In his final years, Duarte continued to fight for the ideals of democracy and freedom, even while in exile. He died in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1876 and was buried there. It wasn't until 1889 that his remains were brought back to the Dominican Republic, where they were honored with a state funeral and placed in the Altar de la Patria monument. Today, Duarte is remembered and celebrated as a key figure in the history and independence of the Dominican Republic.</p><p></p><p>
