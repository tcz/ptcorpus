							Valenti began his career as a stage actor in the 1920s, and later transitioned to film in the 1930s. He appeared in over 30 films, including Luchino Visconti's "Ossessione" (1943), which is considered a landmark film in Italian neorealism. </p><p>However, Valenti's career was also marked by his association with the fascist regime in Italy. He was a member of the Fascist Party and acted in propaganda films during the 1930s. During World War II, Valenti worked as a spy for Mussolini's government and was involved in the torture and execution of anti-fascist resistance fighters. </p><p>After the war, Valenti was captured by Italian partisans and was executed without trial in a public square in Milan. His death remains controversial, with some arguing that he was a victim of political revenge, while others argue that he received due justice for his actions as a fascist sympathizer and spy.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=18620848" title="Wikipedia article about Osvaldo Valenti">Osvaldo Valenti on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Vincenzo Musolino</h2><p><strong>Vincenzo Musolino</strong>
