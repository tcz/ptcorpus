She was also a talented painter and sculptor, with her visual art often reflecting her political beliefs and love of Chilean culture. Her song "Gracias a la Vida" became an anthem for the Latin American left and has been covered by many artists around the world.</p><p>Despite her success, Parra struggled with mental health issues throughout her life and tragically took her own life at the age of 49. Her legacy continues to inspire musicians and artists around the world who seek to keep traditional music alive and use their art to bring attention to social and political issues.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=319049" title="Wikipedia article about Violeta Parra">Violeta Parra on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/bangladeshi-musicians-died-at-age-49.html' title='Bangladeshi musicians died at age 49'><strong>Bangladeshi musicians died at age 49</strong> List of the top 4 Bangladeshi music stars who died when they were 49</a></li><li><a href='/cuban-musicians-died-at-age-50.html' title='Cuban musicians died at age 50'><strong>Cuban musicians died at age 50</strong> List of the top 1 Cuban music stars who died when they were 50</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-crohn-s-disease.html' title='Famous musicians died in Crohn's disease'><strong>Famous musicians died in Crohn's disease</strong> List of the top 3 Famous music stars who died in Crohn's disease</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/british-musicians-died-in-prostate-cancer.html' title='British musicians died in Prostate cancer'><strong>British musicians died in Prostate cancer</strong> List of the top 2 British music stars who died in Prostate cancer</a></li><li><a href='/finnish-musicians-born-in-1978.html' title='Finnish musicians born in 1978'><strong>Finnish musicians born in 1978</strong> List of the top 16 Finnish  music stars who died in who were born in 1978</a></li><li><a href='/jamaican-musicians-died-in-prostate-cancer.html' title='Jamaican musicians died in Prostate cancer'><strong>Jamaican musicians died in Prostate cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Jamaican music stars who died in Prostate cancer</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
