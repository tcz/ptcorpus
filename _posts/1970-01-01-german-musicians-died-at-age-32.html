(August 8, 1833		Kotzen-October 2, 1865)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was an explorer and geographer, known for his travels and expeditions to East Africa. In 1861, he led an expedition to the Horn of Africa in search of the source of the River Tana. However, his greatest ambition was to reach the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, which he attempted in 1862 but was forced to turn back due to harsh weather conditions. He returned to the region in 1865 to make a second attempt but tragically died during the expedition. Despite his unsuccessful attempts to reach the summit, he is remembered for his pioneering work in exploring and mapping the region. The northern Two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) was named after him by German zoologist Wilhelm Peters.</p><p>Von der Decken was born into a noble family and inherited wealth from his father, which allowed him to finance his expeditions. He was also an accomplished ornithologist and collected many specimens during his travels. His travels to East Africa were not just for exploration purposes, as he also had an interest in commerce and trade in the region. He established trading posts and negotiated treaties with local leaders to facilitate trade between the interior of East Africa and the coast. Von der Decken's explorations and writings inspired other European explorers to follow in his footsteps and contributed to European knowledge of East Africa. His legacy lives on through the species named after him, as well as through his maps and journals, which provide valuable insight into the cultural and ecological landscape of the region during the 19th century.</p><p></p><p>
