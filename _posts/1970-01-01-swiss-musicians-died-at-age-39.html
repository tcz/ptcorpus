									</h1><p>Here are 1 famous musicians from Switzerland died at 39:</p><h2>Hugo Koblet</h2><p><strong>Hugo Koblet</strong>
(March 21, 1925		Zürich-November 6, 1964			Egg)


was
a Swiss
professional road racing cyclist.


					</p><p>He began his career as a professional cyclist in 1944 and quickly established himself as one of the sport's top riders. Over the course of his career, he won numerous races including the Tour de France in 1951, becoming the first Swiss cyclist to do so. He also won the Giro d'Italia in 1950 and the La Flèche Wallonne in 1952. In addition to his successes on the road, Koblet was also an accomplished track cyclist, winning two silver medals at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in 1951. Tragically, Koblet's life was cut short when he died in a car accident in 1964 at the age of 39. Despite his relatively short career, he is remembered as one of Switzerland's greatest cyclists and a trailblazer for future generations of Swiss riders.</p><p>Koblet was known for his style and charisma, earning him the nickname "Pédaleur de charme" or "pedaling charmer." He was noted for his smooth and fluid riding style, as well as his skill in descents. Koblet was also admired for his fashion sense, often wearing stylish clothing during races and off the bike as well. In addition to his cycling career, Koblet was also a successful businessman and owned a successful bicycle shop in Zürich. Today, he is remembered through the annual Hugo Koblet Memorial race, held in his honor in Switzerland.</p><p>Koblet had a difficult childhood, with his father abandoning his family when he was only two years old. Despite this, he found solace in cycling, and it quickly became his passion. In 1946, he won his first major race, the GP Lugano, and went on to become one of the most popular and well-respected cyclists of his time. Koblet's victory at the Tour de France in 1951 came after a fierce battle with fellow cyclist Raphaël Géminiani, cementing his status as one of the best climbers in the sport.</p><p>After retiring from cycling, Koblet focused on his businesses, including a successful chain of car dealerships. However, his love for the sport never waned, and he remained involved in cycling until his death. In addition to the Hugo Koblet Memorial race, an annual award is also given in his name to the Swiss cyclist with the best performance in a major international race. Koblet's legacy continues to inspire and motivate new generations of Swiss cyclists, as well as lovers of the sport around the world.</p><p>Koblet's personal life was also marked by turmoil and tragedy. He was married three times and struggled with alcoholism throughout his life. His third marriage, to a 19-year-old Swiss model named Sonia Suter, caused a scandal due to the large age gap between the couple. Their relationship was strained, and they were in the midst of a divorce when Koblet died in the car accident. Many speculate that his alcohol use contributed to the crash, although the exact circumstances of his death remain unclear.</p><p>Despite the controversies in his personal life, Koblet's legacy as a cyclist remains untarnished. He is remembered as a true sportsman who pushed himself to the limits of his physical abilities and inspired a generation of Swiss cyclists to follow in his footsteps. In recognition of his achievements, Koblet was inducted into the UCI Hall of Fame in 2002, cementing his place in the history of the sport he loved.</p><p></p><p>
