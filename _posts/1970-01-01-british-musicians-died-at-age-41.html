(December 16, 1775		Steventon-July 18, 1817			Winchester)

	
		also known as Austen, Jane

	
was
a British
writer and novelist.


					</p><p>Austen's works, which include "Pride and Prejudice" and "Sense and Sensibility", are known for their wit, social commentary, and portrayal of strong female characters. Despite the fact that she only had six completed novels published during her lifetime, Austen has become one of the most widely read and beloved authors in English literature. Her stories have been adapted into numerous films, television series, and other works of art, and her influence on popular culture and literary history continues to be felt today.</p><p>Austen grew up in a close-knit family of eight children, five of whom were brothers. Her father was a clergyman, and the family often struggled with financial difficulties. Despite this, Austen received a relatively extensive education at home, thanks in large part to her father's library, which contained an impressive collection of books.</p><p>As a young woman, Austen began writing in earnest. Her early works, such as "Lady Susan" and "The Watsons," were not published during her lifetime, though they would later be recognized as important precursors to her mature work. Her breakthrough came with the publication of "Sense and Sensibility" in 1811, which was followed by "Pride and Prejudice" in 1813.</p><p>Austen's writing often dealt with themes of marriage, social class, and the role of women in society. Her novels were praised for their realism and attention to the details of everyday life, as well as for their sharp wit and satire. Though her works were popular during her lifetime, it was not until the 20th century that Austen's reputation as a major literary figure was fully established.</p><p>Today, Austen is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential writers in the history of English literature. Her novels continue to be read, discussed, and adapted for new generations of readers, and her legacy as a keen observer of human behavior and the complexities of social interaction endures.</p><p></p><p>
						She died caused by tuberculosis.

		a.k.a. Felicia Dorothea Hemans, Felicia Dorothea Browne or Felicia Dorothea Browne Hemans

	
was
a British
writer, poet and playwright.


					</p><p>Despite her early success as a poet, Hemans faced many challenges throughout her life, including financial difficulties and family tragedies. Despite these obstacles, she continued to write prolifically throughout her career and was praised for her ability to capture the emotions and experiences of women in her poetry. Hemans was particularly known for her patriotic depictions of England and her deep interest in historical and mythological subjects. Her works were widely popular during the Romantic era, and her legacy continues to inspire poets and writers today.</p><p>Hemans was born Felicia Dorothea Browne, but took the surname Hemans after her marriage to Captain Alfred Hemans in 1812. They had five children together, but their marriage was tumultuous and ended in separation. Hemans supported her family through her writing and achieved significant success during her lifetime, publishing numerous volumes of poetry and plays. She also contributed to literary periodicals and was a popular lecturer. Despite her popularity, Hemans faced criticism from some literary critics who belittled her work as overly sentimental and lacking in depth. In addition to her writing, Hemans was also involved in philanthropy and supported several charitable causes throughout her life. She died at the age of 41 from complications after sustaining a fall. Her legacy as a pioneering female writer of the Romantic era continues to be celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 2015		England-April 5, 1973			Kenya)


was
a British
engineer and magician.


					</p><p>During World War II, Jasper Maskelyne was enlisted by the British Army as an engineer to develop camouflage techniques to deceive the enemy. He was known for creating large-scale illusions, such as using inflatable tanks to make the enemy think there were more troops than there actually were. After the war, he continued his career in magic and performed worldwide. He even wrote a book, "Magic: Top Secret," where he shared some of his wartime illusions.</p><p>In addition to creating large-scale illusions during World War II, Jasper Maskelyne also developed small-scale illusions to help soldiers evade capture or death. He invented a miniature deck of cards that, when wet, could reveal maps or coded messages to soldiers. He also created a compass that looked like a button, allowing soldiers to discreetly navigate without being detected by enemy forces. After the war, Maskelyne continued to work as a magician and became one of the most popular performers in London, performing for royalty and celebrities. He also invented a number of magic tricks, including his famous "Floating Ball," which remains a staple in many magicians' acts.

(July 21, 1648		Glamis-July 27, 1689			Killiecrankie)


was
a British
personality.


					</p><p>He was a Scottish soldier who played a significant role in the Jacobite rising of 1689. Graham supported the claims of King James VII and II to the throne and led a successful campaign in Scotland, which resulted in the capture of several key towns and cities. He was known for his bravery and military skill, earning the nickname "Bonnie Dundee" among his supporters.</p><p>Despite initial successes, Graham suffered a fatal blow at the Battle of Killiecrankie, where he was killed by a musket ball to the head. His death was a significant setback for the Jacobite cause, as he was one of its most charismatic and effective commanders. Nevertheless, Graham's memory continued to inspire Jacobite supporters for many years after his death, and he remains a prominent figure in Scottish history.</p><p>Prior to his involvement in the Jacobite uprising, John Graham was a prominent Scottish soldier who served in various conflicts, including the Franco-Dutch War and the Nine Years' War. He was also a Member of Parliament for Dundee and a staunch supporter of the Stuart monarchy. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which saw James VII and II deposed and replaced by William and Mary, Graham refused to acknowledge the new monarchs and rallied support for James's cause.</p><p>Graham's military prowess and leadership were on full display during the Jacobite uprising of 1689. He led his troops in a series of decisive victories and was instrumental in capturing key strongholds such as Edinburgh and Stirling. His charisma and bravery earned him the loyalty of his troops, who affectionately called him "Bonnie Dundee".</p><p>The Battle of Killiecrankie, however, proved to be Graham's downfall. Despite leading his troops to a stunning victory over a larger government force, he was fatally wounded by a musket ball to the head. His death was a great loss to the Jacobite cause, and his legend only grew in the years following his passing.</p><p>Today, John Graham is remembered as a symbol of Scottish loyalty to the Stuart dynasty and a heroic figure in Scottish history. His story has been immortalized in literature and music, most notably in the famous Scottish ballad "Bonnie Dundee".</p><p></p><p>
