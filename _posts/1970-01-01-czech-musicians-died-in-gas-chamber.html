						Despite his short life, Pavel Haas left a significant mark on classical music. He studied with one of the most prominent Czech composers of the time, Leoš Janáček, who had a profound influence on his music. Many of Haas's compositions reflect his Jewish heritage, including his Scherzo for an Orchestra in Jewish Style.</p><p>As a Jewish musician in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, Haas faced continuous persecution. He was eventually deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1941, where he continued to compose despite the horrific conditions. One of his most famous works, the opera "From the Monkey Mountains," was written during his time in the camp.</p><p>Sadly, Haas was eventually transferred to Auschwitz, where he was murdered in the gas chambers in 1944. His legacy lives on through his music, which is still performed and studied today.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=2383718" title="Wikipedia article about Pavel Haas">Pavel Haas on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/colombian-actors-died-in-pneumonia.html' title='Colombian actors died in Pneumonia'><strong>Colombian actors died in Pneumonia</strong> List of the top 1 Colombian actors who died in Pneumonia</a></li><li><a href='/greek-actors-died-at-age-59.html' title='Greek actors died at age 59'><strong>Greek actors died at age 59</strong> List of the top 2 Greek actors who died when they were 59</a></li><li><a href='/canadian-actors-died-in-1965.html' title='Canadian actors died in 1965'><strong>Canadian actors died in 1965</strong> List of the top 3 Canadian actors who died in 1965</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/chilean-musicians-died-at-age-36.html' title='Chilean musicians died at age 36'><strong>Chilean musicians died at age 36</strong> List of the top 2 Chilean music stars who died when they were 36</a></li><li><a href='/brazilian-actors-died-in-1985.html' title='Brazilian actors died in 1985'><strong>Brazilian actors died in 1985</strong> List of the top 1 Brazilian actors who died in 1985</a></li><li><a href='/thai-musicians-died-at-age-78.html' title='Thai musicians died at age 78'><strong>Thai musicians died at age 78</strong> List of the top 1 Thai music stars who died when they were 78</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
