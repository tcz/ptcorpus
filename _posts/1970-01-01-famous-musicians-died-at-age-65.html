(November 12, 1877		Philadelphia-September 13, 1943)

	
		also known as John Neill or John Rea Neill

	
was
an American
writer.


					</p><p>More specifically, John R. Neill was an American illustrator and cartoonist, primarily known for his work on the Oz series of books by L. Frank Baum. Neill illustrated many of the later Oz books and eventually wrote and illustrated three Oz books himself. He also illustrated other children's books, comic strips, and advertising artwork. Neill began his career as an artist in Philadelphia and later moved to New York City, where he worked for several newspapers and magazines before eventually becoming a full-time illustrator for the Oz books. Neill's illustrations are known for their detailed and whimsical style, and many of his character designs for the Oz books have become iconic.</p><p>Neill received his early art training from his father, who was a painter and engraver, and later studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. As a young artist, Neill worked for several Philadelphia newspapers and magazines, illustrating stories, advertisements, and political cartoons. In 1904, he moved to New York City and began working for the New York Herald, where he illustrated many of their Sunday supplement comics.</p><p>In 1907, Neill was recruited by L. Frank Baum to illustrate the third book in the Oz series, "Ozma of Oz". Neill went on to illustrate several more books in the series, including "Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz" and "The Road to Oz". Neill's illustrations for the Oz books were highly detailed and imaginative, and he was praised for his ability to bring Baum's fantastical world to life.</p><p>In addition to his work on the Oz books, Neill also illustrated many other children's books, including "The Sea Fairies" and "The Sky Island" by Baum, and "The Wonder City of Oz" and "The Scalawagons of Oz", which he wrote and illustrated himself. Neill also created several comic strips, including "Fairylogue and Radio-Plays" and "The Little Scarecrow Boy".</p><p>Despite his success as an illustrator and writer, Neill struggled with financial difficulties throughout his life. He passed away in 1943 at the age of 65, but his illustrations for the Oz books continue to inspire and delight readers to this day.</p><p>One interesting fact about John R. Neill is that he was responsible for coining the phrase "The Merry Old Land of Oz" in his illustrations for Baum's book "The Road to Oz". The phrase has since become synonymous with the Oz series and is often used in adaptations and references to the books.</p><p>Another notable achievement of Neill is that he contributed to the development of early animation. In the early 1910s, Neill created a series of animated cartoons using a technique called the "flicker book", in which a sequence of images is printed on a stack of cards and flipped to create the illusion of motion. His cartoons were shown in theaters as part of a vaudeville act called "Fairylogue and Radio-Plays" and were some of the earliest examples of animation in American cinema.</p><p>Today, Neill's illustrations for the Oz books are highly sought after by collectors and his contributions to the world of children's literature and animation continue to be celebrated.</p><p></p><p>

He was later accused of war crimes for his involvement in the torture and execution of Chinese prisoners during the war.</p><p>After Japan's surrender in 1945, Doihara was arrested by the Allied forces and put on trial for his war crimes. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging, which was carried out in 1948.</p><p>Doihara's nickname was "Lawrence of Manchuria" due to his involvement in the creation and governance of the puppet state. He was known for his cunning and manipulation, and was often referred to as the "Devil of Harbin".

He was found guilty of crimes against peace, including conspiracy to wage wars of aggression, and crimes against humanity, including the abuse and murder of prisoners of war and civilians. His execution in 1948 marked the end of a chapter in Japanese history that was marked by militarism, expansionism, and atrocities committed against innocent people.</p><p>In addition to his military and diplomatic career, Kenji Doihara was also a prolific writer.

(February 12, 1932-February 8, 1998			Chevy Chase)

	
		also known as Julian Simon or Julian Lincoln Simon

	
was
an American
professor and economist.


					</p><p>He was born in Newark, New Jersey and received his PhD in Economics from the University of Chicago. Simon was a prolific writer and his research focused on resource scarcity, population growth, and technological advancement. He famously bet Paul Ehrlich, a biologist and author of the book "The Population Bomb," that the prices of five metals - copper, chromium, nickel, tin, and tungsten - would decrease over the course of a decade due to technological advances, rather than increase due to scarcity. Simon won the bet and his victory helped to refute the notion that population growth and resource depletion were inevitable. Simon was a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and later at the University of Maryland, College Park. He also served as a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute. Simon passed away in 1998 at the age of 65.</p><p>Simon was not only an expert in economics but also a demographer, statistician, and political scientist. He served as the chairman of the Government Accountability Project, an organization that works to promote government and corporate accountability, from 1979 to 1983. Simon received numerous awards for his work, including the Francis Boyer Award from the American Enterprise Institute and the Outstanding Scholar Award from the Association for Private Enterprise Education. Throughout his career, he authored or co-authored over a dozen books, including "The Ultimate Resource," which argues that human creativity and innovation are the ultimate resources that help solve environmental and economic challenges. Simon's ideas have been influential in shaping policy and public debate on population growth, natural resources, and environmental protection.</p><p>Simon was also known for his controversial stance on immigration. He believed that unrestricted immigration could be beneficial for the economy and that immigrants contribute positively to society. This view, however, was not always popular and Simon was criticized by some for advocating for policies that would bring in more immigrants. In addition to his work on resource scarcity and population growth, Simon was also a respected theorist in the field of public choice, which examines how human behavior and incentives affect decision-making in the public sector. Simon's theories and ideas continue to be studied and debated in academic and policy circles, and his legacy as a pioneering economist and thinker remains strong.</p><p></p><p>

Her family moved to Chicago when she was still young, and it was there that she began her career in the performing arts.

Her performance was so popular that she was invited to perform for a private audience with the President of France.After retiring from performing, Fuller continued to innovate in the arts. She created several designs for theater sets and costumes, and even designed a unique kind of folding umbrella that she patented.Fuller's personal life was not well-documented, but it is known that she never married and had no children. However, she maintained close relationships with many artists and intellectuals of the time, including playwright Sarah Bernhardt and inventor Alexander Graham Bell.Fuller's legacy continues to be celebrated, and her work has been the subject of several exhibitions and retrospectives. In 2020, she was posthumously inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame for her contributions to the arts and her pioneering spirit.</p><p></p><p>
