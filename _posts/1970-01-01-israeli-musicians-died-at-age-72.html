(November 18, 1908-March 25, 1981)

	
		a.k.a. Ratosh, Yonatan

	
was
an Israeli
personality.


					</p><p>He was a poet, philosopher, and political activist who founded the Israeli political movement known as "Cananites". Ratosh was born in Russia and immigrated to Palestine with his family as a young child. He studied at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where he became involved in left-wing political groups. </p><p>In the 1930s, Ratosh became disillusioned with the idea of a Jewish state and began advocating for a Canaanite identity, which rejected nationalism and instead embraced the ancient culture and history of the region. He continued to write poetry and essays throughout his life, becoming an influential figure in Israeli literary circles. </p><p>In addition to his literary and philosophical work, Ratosh was also a political activist, advocating for the rights of Palestinians and other marginalized groups in Israel. His political and philosophical ideas continue to be debated and discussed in Israel and beyond, and he is remembered as a complex and provocative figure who challenged the conventional wisdom of his time.</p><p>Ratosh's ideas were not always well-received, and he faced criticism and even censorship throughout his life. However, he remained committed to his beliefs, and his influence can be seen in the work of many contemporary Israeli writers and thinkers. In the 1940s and 1950s, Ratosh was involved in several political organizations, including the Herut party and the National Workers' Union. However, he became disillusioned with these groups as well, and in 1954 he founded the Canaanite movement, which aimed to create a new, non-nationalistic identity for Israel based on the ancient cultures of the region. </p><p>Ratosh was also involved in translating a number of significant literary works into Hebrew, including works by Friedrich Nietzsche and Ernest Hemingway. He was a prolific writer, publishing numerous books of poetry, essays, and philosophy throughout his life. Ratosh died in Tel Aviv in 1981, but his ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars and intellectuals in Israel and around the world. Despite often being seen as a controversial figure, Ratosh's contributions to Israeli literature, politics, and philosophy continue to be celebrated and remembered today.</p><p></p><p>
