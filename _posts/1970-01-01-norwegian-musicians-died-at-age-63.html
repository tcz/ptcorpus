His other notable works include "Døden er et kjærtegn" (Death Is a Caress) (1976) and "Saken Ruth Vang" (The Ruth Vang Case) (1976).</p><p>Løkkeberg's films often addressed controversial themes, such as sexuality, religion, and politics. He was a fearless filmmaker, unafraid to challenge societal norms and expectations. However, his confrontational style also drew criticism from some critics and audiences.</p><p>In addition to his work as a filmmaker, Løkkeberg was also a trained actor and musician. He appeared in several of his own films and played the lead role in the film "Operasjon Cobra" (1978) directed by the acclaimed Norwegian director, Oddvar Bull Tuhus.</p><p>Throughout his career, Pål Løkkeberg developed a reputation for being a perfectionist, with a meticulous attention to detail. He often spent extended periods of time on his films, sometimes taking years to complete them. Despite this, he only made a handful of feature films during his career.Løkkeberg's work gained renewed interest in the 2000s, with retrospectives of his films being held in several countries. Criticisms of his controversial and confrontational style have been reevaluated in light of the renewed interest in his work, with many now viewing him as a pioneer of Norwegian cinema. Løkkeberg passed away at the age of 63, leaving behind a legacy as one of Norway's most fearless and innovative directors.</p><p>It is worth noting that Pål Løkkeberg's personal life was almost as controversial as his films.
