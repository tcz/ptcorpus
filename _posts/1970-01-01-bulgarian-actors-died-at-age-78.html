						</p><p>
							He served as Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Bulgaria and was a member of the Bulgarian parliament during World War II. Peshev is best known for his courageous act of defying the anti-Semitic policies of the Bulgarian government by leading a group of politicians, clergymen, and intellectuals in preventing the deportation of around 48,000 Bulgarian Jews to the Nazi death camps. He was later arrested, imprisoned, and sentenced to death by the Communist government for his opposition to their policies, but his sentence was changed to life imprisonment after international pressure. Peshev was eventually released in 1962 and continued to be a prominent figure in Bulgarian politics until his death. In addition to his political career, Peshev was also a well-known actor in Bulgaria and appeared in several films during the 1930s and 1940s. He was posthumously awarded the title "Righteous Among the Nations" by Yad Vashem, Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, for his courageous efforts to save the Bulgarian Jews.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=3219536" title="Wikipedia article about Dimitar Peshev">Dimitar Peshev on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/german-actors-died-at-age-77.html' title='German actors died at age 77'><strong>German actors died at age 77</strong> List of the top 14 German actors who died when they were 77</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-actors-died-in-alzheimer-s-disease.html' title='Austrian actors died in Alzheimer's disease'><strong>Austrian actors died in Alzheimer's disease</strong> List of the top 2 Austrian actors who died in Alzheimer's disease</a></li><li><a href='/brazilian-actors-died-in-natural-causes.html' title='Brazilian actors died in Natural causes'><strong>Brazilian actors died in Natural causes</strong> List of the top 1 Brazilian actors who died in Natural causes</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/new-zealand-actors-died-at-age-70.html' title='New Zealand actors died at age 70'><strong>New Zealand actors died at age 70</strong> List of the top 1 New Zealand actors who died when they were 70</a></li><li><a href='/south-korean-musicians-died-in-myocardial-infarction.html' title='South Korean musicians died in Myocardial infarction'><strong>South Korean musicians died in Myocardial infarction</strong> List of the top 1 South Korean music stars who died in Myocardial infarction</a></li><li><a href='/filipino-actors-died-at-age-55.html' title='Filipino actors died at age 55'><strong>Filipino actors died at age 55</strong> List of the top 1 Filipino actors who died when they were 55</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
