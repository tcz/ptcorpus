Abul Djabar made significant contributions to several fields, including algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. He wrote several books, including "Kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-jabr wal-muqabala" ("The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing"), which laid the foundations of algebra as a mathematical discipline. He is also known for his work on the development of the decimal system and its use in mathematical calculations. Abul Djabar's philosophical and mystical writings, such as "Kimya-yi sa'ƒÅdat" ("The Alchemy of Happiness"), are still studied today. He is considered one of the most important scholars of Islamic civilization and a pillar of the Islamic Golden Age.</p><p>Abul Djabar was born in a family of Turkic origin who were adherents of the Mu'tazilite school of Islamic theology. Abul Djabar was educated in Tus and later traveled to various parts of the Islamic world, including Baghdad, Cairo, and possibly India. In addition to mathematics and astronomy, he also studied Islamic jurisprudence, theology, grammar, and literature.</p><p>Abul Djabar's contributions to mathematics and science were particularly significant. He made major breakthroughs in algebra, including the concept of using letters to represent unknown quantities and the use of systematic methods for solving equations. He also contributed to the development of trigonometry and wrote a treatise on the astrolabe, a device used for astronomical measurements.</p><p>Abul Djabar was a prolific writer and his works encompassed a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, ethics, spirituality, and mysticism.
