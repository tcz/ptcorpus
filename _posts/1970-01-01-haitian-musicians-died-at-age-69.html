(February 15, 1906		Haiti-April 5, 1975)


was
a Haitian
writer.


					</p><p>He was considered to be one of the leading literary figures of the Negritude movement in the Caribbean. Savain was born in Port-au-Prince and received his primary education there. Later, he studied psychology and philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris. He published his first book of poems, "Les Rythmes Cables", in 1938. Savain was known for his politically charged and subversive writing style, which often challenged the status quo of Haitian society. In his later years, he became an important figure in Haitian politics, using his writing to denounce the dictatorship of François "Papa Doc" Duvalier. Despite facing censorship and persecution, Savain continued to write until his death in 1975. Today, he is considered to be one of the most important Haitian writers of the 20th century.</p><p>Savain was also actively involved in the promotion of Haitian culture and the arts, and was a member of several cultural organizations such as the Société des Gens de Lettres in Paris and the Société d'Histoire et de Géographie d'Haiti. He was also a co-founder of the Haitian Writers' Institute, which aimed to encourage and support young Haitian writers.</p><p>In addition to his poetry, Savain also wrote novels and essays. His most notable work in this genre is the novel "Un Nègre raconte" (A Negro Speaks), published in 1953. The novel is a fictionalized autobiographical account of the author's experiences growing up as a black man in Haiti, and explores themes of racism, classism, and colonialism.</p><p>Savain's legacy as a writer and cultural figure continues to be celebrated in Haiti and throughout the Caribbean. In 2006, the Haitian government posthumously awarded him the Order of Honor and Merit, the country's highest civilian honor, in recognition of his contributions to Haitian literature and culture.</p><p></p><p>
