						</p><p>Bernie Mac began his career as a stand-up comedian in Chicago before gaining national fame with his appearances on HBO's Def Comedy Jam and his own sitcom, The Bernie Mac Show, which aired from 2001 to 2006. He also appeared in several films, including the Ocean's Eleven franchise, Friday, and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. </p><p>Mac was known for his unique and unapologetic style of comedy, which often tackled controversial topics. He was also known for his philanthropic work, particularly his support of organizations that helped children, as well as his advocacy for organ donation after receiving a kidney transplant in 2005. </p><p>In August 2008, Bernie Mac passed away from complications due to pneumonia. He was remembered as a trailblazer in the comedy world and a beloved figure in the entertainment industry.</p><p>In addition to his successful career in comedy and acting, Bernie Mac was also a successful author, having written the book "I Ain't Scared of You: Bernie Mac on How Life Is" which was released in 2001. The book chronicled his life growing up in Chicago and his rise to fame as a comedian. Mac was also a dedicated family man and often incorporated stories about his wife Rhonda and their daughter into his stand-up routines. He credited his family with keeping him grounded and helping him navigate the ups and downs of fame. Even after his death, Bernie Mac's legacy continues to live on through his work as an entertainer and his impact on the comedy world.</p><p>Mac was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, where he attended Chicago Vocational High School. After high school, he worked a variety of odd jobs before eventually pursuing a career in stand-up comedy. His big break came in 1990 when he won the Miller Lite Comedy Search, which led to his first appearance on Def Comedy Jam. From there, he went on to appear on several other television shows, including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. </p><p>Despite his success in the entertainment industry, Mac was not without his share of personal struggles. In addition to his kidney transplant, he also battled sarcoidosis, a chronic lung disease. However, he remained optimistic and continued to work on his craft up until his death.</p><p>Mac's influence can still be seen in the work of many comedians today, and his impact on the industry has been recognized with posthumous awards and honors, including induction into the Chicago Film Critics Association Hall of Fame. His charitable work also lives on through the Bernie Mac Foundation, which was established in his memory to raise awareness for Sarcoidosis and provide support for those affected by the disease.</p><p></p><p>
