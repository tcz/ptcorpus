									</h1><p>Here are 6 famous musicians from Switzerland died at 50:</p><h2>Jacob Bernoulli</h2><p><strong>Jacob Bernoulli</strong>
(December 27, 1654		Basel-August 16, 1705			Old Swiss Confederacy)

	
		also known as James Bernoulli or Jacques Bernoulli

	
was
a Swiss
scientist and mathematician.


					</p><p>He came from a famous family of mathematicians, including his father Johann Bernoulli and his brother Johann Bernoulli. Jacob Bernoulli made significant contributions in several areas of mathematics, including calculus, probability theory, and logarithms. He is most famous for his work on the law of large numbers in probability theory, which states that as the number of trials in a probability experiment increases, the long-term average of the outcomes will approach the theoretical probability. Bernoulli's work on calculus helped lay the foundations for the field, and he also discovered the mathematical constant e, which is now known as Euler's number. Jacob Bernoulli's contributions to the field of mathematics have had a lasting impact on the discipline, and he is still studied and revered by mathematicians worldwide.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to mathematics, Jacob Bernoulli also made important contributions to the field of physics. He studied the dynamics of fluids, and published a fundamental work on fluid mechanics known as "Hydrodynamica." Bernoulli's principle, which describes the relationship between fluid speed and pressure, is named after him. </p><p>Bernoulli worked and corresponded with many of the top scientists and mathematicians of his day, including Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. He was a member of several scientific societies, including the Royal Society of London and the Berlin Academy of Sciences.</p><p>Jacob Bernoulli's impact on mathematics and science extended beyond his own lifetime, as his work influenced many future mathematicians and scientists. Today, he is widely regarded as one of the foremost mathematicians of the late 17th century.</p><p></p><p>

(May 24, 1743		Boudry-July 13, 1793			Paris)


was
a Swiss
physician, politician, scientist and journalist.


					</p><p>Marat was best known for his role as a radical journalist during the French Revolution. He published a newspaper named "L'Ami du peuple" (The People's Friend), which became a popular voice for the lower classes and advocated for the overthrow of the monarchy. He was also a member of the radical Jacobin Club and served in the National Convention, where he became a prominent figure in the debates over the fate of Louis XVI. Despite his contributions to the revolution, Marat was also notorious for his outspokenness and his fiery, often violent rhetoric. He was frequently targets of personal attacks, and he suffered from a debilitating skin disease that left him confined to a medicinal bath for hours each day. Marat's assassination in his bath by a royalist sympathizer named Charlotte Corday made him a martyr to the revolutionary cause and cemented his place in history as a symbol of revolutionary fervor.</p><p>In addition to his political activities, Marat also made significant contributions to the field of science. He conducted experiments in optics and electricity and published several scientific treatises. Marat's work on the nature of fire earned him membership in the prestigious Royal Society of London in 1777.</p><p>Despite his scientific achievements, Marat's legacy is most closely associated with his role in the French Revolution. In addition to his writing, he played a key role in organizing the popular uprisings that swept through Paris in the summer of 1792. He used his newspaper to call for the creation of a revolutionary government and the establishment of a republic. Marat was also a fierce advocate for the rights of women, publishing several articles calling for gender equality.</p><p>After Marat's death, he was hailed as a martyr by the Jacobins, who used his legacy to justify the Reign of Terror. However, his reputation suffered during the subsequent decades, as many French citizens came to view him as a dangerous demagogue who had contributed to the violence and chaos of the revolution. Today, Marat is remembered as one of the most influential radical thinkers of his time, whose ideas and writings helped to shape the course of modern French politics.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in assassination.

was
a Swiss
personality.


					</p><p>He was a geologist and paleontologist known for his work on the Jura Mountains in western Switzerland. Gressly discovered and described various geological formations of the Jurassic Period, including the Aalenian, Bajocian, and Bathonian stages. He also conducted detailed studies of fossilized ammonites, which helped to establish the geologic timescale. In addition to his scientific work, Gressly was also a gifted artist and produced numerous illustrations of fossils and geological formations. His contributions to the field of geology have earned him recognition as one of Switzerland's most important natural scientists.</p><p>Gressly's early interest in natural history was sparked by his surroundings in the Jura Mountains. In 1833, he began studying law and theology at the University of Basel, but he soon switched to natural sciences. After completing his studies, he spent several years traveling and studying geology in Europe before returning to Switzerland.</p><p>In 1838, Gressly discovered the Aalenian stage in the Jura Mountains, a significant contribution to the understanding of the Jurassic Period. He also studied the Bajocian and Bathonian stages and their corresponding ammonite fossils in great detail, further defining the geologic timescale.</p><p>Gressly worked closely with other prominent geologists of his time, including Louis Agassiz and Johann Jakob Scheuchzer. He was a member of the Swiss Geological Society and played an active role in the organization's activities.</p><p>Despite his scientific achievements, Gressly struggled financially throughout his life. He earned a modest income as a private tutor and relied on the support of friends and patrons to fund his research.</p><p>Gressly's legacy lives on through his numerous publications, which continue to be referenced by geologists today. The genus Gresslya, a type of Jurassic ammonite, was named in his honor.</p><p></p><p>
