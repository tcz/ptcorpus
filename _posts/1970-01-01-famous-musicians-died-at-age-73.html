									</h1><p>Here are 24 famous musicians from the world died at 73:</p><h2>Emma Jung</h2><p><strong>Emma Jung</strong>
(March 30, 1882		Schaffhausen-November 27, 1955			Zürich)

	
		also known as Emma Rauschenbach

	
was
a Swiss
psychoanalyst.


					
			
		Her children
		are
		called
		Agathe Niehus, Gret Baumann, Franz Jung-Merker, Marianne Niehus and Helene Hoerni.

						</p><p>Emma Jung was also the wife and professional partner of the renowned Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung. She was born into a wealthy, industrialist family and married Carl in 1903. She was one of the first female psychoanalysts and was actively involved in her husband's research, all while raising five children. Emma's own research focused on the symbolism in fairy tales, and she is well known for her collaboration with her husband on his book, "Man and His Symbols." Emma's role in her husband's work has been acknowledged by many, including Carl himself, who once said, "Without Emma Jung's collaboration, my work would have been impossible."</p><p>Emma Jung was also noted for her work in developing the unique system of therapy known as "active imagination". This involved the patient being guided to recall dreams or fantasies, then exploring and interpreting these images under the guidance of the therapist. Through her work with patients using this technique, Emma Jung became increasingly interested in the symbolism found in myths, legends and fairy tales. This led her to develop her own theories on the interpretation of symbols in psychological practice, which were subsequently published in articles and books. Emma Jung was a strong advocate for women's rights, and believed that women had an important role to play in society, both as mothers and as professionals. She was a founding member of the C.G. Jung Institute in Zürich, and worked tirelessly to promote the study and practice of psychoanalysis throughout her life. Emma Jung died in 1955, and is remembered today as a pioneering and influential figure in the field of psychoanalysis.</p><p></p><p>

(May 18, 1822		Warren County-January 15, 1896			New York City)


was
an American
photographer, journalist and photojournalist.


					</p><p>Mathew Brady is best known for his portraits of American politicians and celebrities, as well as his documentation of the American Civil War. Brady's photographs of the war were some of the first to show the harsh realities of combat and its aftermath. He operated a photographic studio in New York City, where he employed a team of photographers and assistants to help him produce his work. He also created an extensive archive of photographs, many of which are still widely recognized today. Despite his contributions to the field of photography, Brady struggled financially in later life and died in relative obscurity. However, his legacy as a pioneer of photojournalism and a chronicler of American history continues to be celebrated today.</p><p>Brady was born in Warren County, New York, to Irish immigrant parents. He grew up in Saratoga County, where he attended school before becoming an apprentice in a jewelry store. In the late 1830s, he moved to New York City to pursue a career in the emerging field of photography. He opened his own studio in 1844 and quickly became popular among New York's elite.</p><p>Brady's success allowed him to travel extensively throughout the United States and Europe, where he photographed notable figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, and Queen Victoria. During the American Civil War, Brady was granted permission by President Lincoln to document the conflict. He and his team of photographers captured thousands of images that illustrated the harsh realities of war for the first time.</p><p>After the war, Brady attempted to publish a book featuring his photographs of the conflict but was ultimately unsuccessful. He was forced to sell his studio and lost much of his money trying to recover the costs associated with his war documentary project. The US Congress did eventually purchase his archive of Civil War images in 1875, but unfortunately, Brady did not live to see the recognition that ultimately came to his work.</p><p></p><p>

(June 16, 1804		Andover-September 1, 1877			Watertown)


was
an American
businessperson.


					</p><p>He was the founder of Adams and Company, which later became the Adams Express Company, one of the largest and most successful express delivery companies in the United States during the mid-19th century. Adams started the company at the age of 23 with just $600 and a handful of clients. He quickly expanded the business by building relationships with other companies, such as railroad and steamship companies, to transport packages and letters across the country. </p><p>Adams was also a philanthropist and gave generously to the community. In 1851, he helped establish the Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which became one of the most respected hospitals in the country. He also served as the first president of the Boston YMCA and was involved with various other charitable organizations throughout his life. </p><p>Adams was known for his integrity and dedication to his work, and his success in the express delivery industry helped pave the way for the growth of modern-day package delivery services. He remained active in business until his death in 1877, leaving behind a legacy of entrepreneurship and philanthropy.</p><p>Adams was born in Andover, Massachusetts, and grew up as one of seven children in a farming family. Despite not having a formal education, he was a quick learner and showed an aptitude for math and business at an early age. After working as a clerk in a local store, he moved to Boston in 1831 and started his own business as a commission merchant. Adams's business suffered during the Panic of 1837, which led him to take up the idea of an express delivery service.</p><p>Adams built his company on the principles of efficiency, speed, and reliability. He personally oversaw the transportation of goods and ensured that they arrived at their destination in a timely and secure manner. His dedication to customer service and his willingness to go the extra mile for his clients helped him build a loyal following, which in turn helped him expand his operations.</p><p>Adams's success did not come without challenges, however. He faced competition from other express companies, and he had to deal with the logistical challenges of delivering goods across vast distances in a time when railroads did not yet exist. Nevertheless, Adams persevered and continued to innovate his business, introducing new technologies like the telegraph and the steamship into his operations.</p><p>Adams's legacy lives on in the Adams Express Company, which he founded and which eventually merged with other express companies to form American Express. His contributions to the express delivery industry helped transform it into the efficient and reliable service that we know today.</p><p></p><p>
