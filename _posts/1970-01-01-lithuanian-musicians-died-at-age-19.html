a Lithuanian
photographer, painter, artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>Moi Ver was born into a Jewish family in Vilnius, Lithuania in 1904. He developed an interest in art at a young age and went on to study painting and sculpture in Paris. However, it was his interest in photography that led him to become one of the most influential photographers of his time.</p><p>Ver's work is characterized by his use of light and shadow, which created dramatic and striking images. He was noted for his portraits of people from different countries and cultures and was an early exponent of the documentary style of photography.</p><p>Ver traveled extensively throughout his career, capturing images from Eastern Europe, Russia, Palestine, and the United States. His photographs were widely exhibited and published in magazines and books, and he was recognized as one of the most important photographers of his generation.</p><p>Apart from photography, Moi Ver was also an accomplished painter and visual artist, and his work reflects his interest in the interplay between art and photography. He died on his 91st birthday in 1995, leaving behind an impressive body of work that continues to be celebrated today.</p><p>Ver's photography career began in the 1920s, and he quickly gained recognition for his unique approach to the medium. He often experimented with different techniques and materials, such as solarization, multiple exposures, and photograms, which helped him create surreal and abstract images. His work was seen as a departure from traditional photography, which focused on sharp detail and clarity. Instead, Ver sought to capture the essence of his subject through mood and atmosphere.</p><p>Ver's photographs were also known for their political and social commentary. He documented the effects of poverty and war on ordinary people, and his images often conveyed a sense of empathy and compassion for his subjects. His photographs from the Spanish Civil War, for example, were some of the first to show the human toll of the conflict.</p><p>In addition to his photography and painting, Ver also worked as a filmmaker, producing documentaries and experimental films. He believed that film was a powerful medium for conveying his artistic vision, and he often incorporated elements of his photography and painting into his films.</p><p>Throughout his career, Ver received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the prestigious Guggenheim fellowship. His photographs are held in the collections of major museums around the world, and his legacy continues to inspire photographers and artists today.</p><p></p><p>

(February 22, 1953		Alytus-May 15, 1972			Kaunas)


was
a Lithuanian
factory worker.


					</p><p>Romas Kalanta became known for his act of self-immolation, which he performed as a protest against the Soviet occupation of Lithuania. His death sparked public outcry and became a symbol of resistance against the Soviet regime. Kalanta was a factory worker who was known for his interest in music and poetry. He was also an active member of the Lithuanian underground resistance movement in the 1970s. Following his death, thousands of people attended his funeral and he was posthumously awarded the Order of the Cross of Vytis, the highest civilian honor in Lithuania. Kalanta's legacy is still celebrated today, with memorials and events dedicated to him and his sacrifice for Lithuanian independence.</p><p>Kalanta's act of self-immolation took place on May 14, 1972, in the center of Kaunas, the second-largest city in Lithuania. He poured gasoline over his body and set himself on fire, while shouting "Freedom for Lithuania!". Despite efforts by bystanders to put out the flames, Kalanta suffered severe burns that proved fatal the following day. The incident led to a wave of protests in Lithuania, with many people taking to the streets to demand greater independence from Soviet rule. The Soviet authorities responded with a crackdown on dissent and increased surveillance of the Lithuanian population. However, Kalanta's legacy continued to inspire later generations of Lithuanians who fought for independence from the Soviet Union. Today, he is widely regarded as a martyr for the Lithuanian cause and a symbol of resistance against oppression.</p><p></p><p>
