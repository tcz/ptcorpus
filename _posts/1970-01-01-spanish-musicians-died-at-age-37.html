(April 5, 1875-February 18, 1913)

	
		also known as Gustavo Madero

	
was
a Spanish
politician.


					</p><p>However, he is mainly remembered as a key figure in the Mexican Revolution. Along with his brother Francisco I. Madero, Gustavo led the revolution against the dictatorship of President Porfirio Díaz. Gustavo played a crucial role in organizing and financing the revolution through his extensive network of contacts in the United States. After Díaz was ousted, Gustavo continued to be involved in Mexican politics and was elected Senator in 1912. Sadly, Gustavo A. Madero was assassinated only a year later by Victoriano Huerta, who seized power and ultimately plunged the country into a new phase of violence and turmoil. Despite his untimely death, Gustavo A. Madero remains an important historical figure in Mexico's fight for democracy and social justice.</p><p>Gustavo A. Madero was born in Parras de la Fuente, Coahuila, Mexico. He came from a wealthy family in the northern state of Chihuahua, where he received his education. Gustavo was a successful businessman before entering politics, working in the mining and agricultural industries. He was also involved in journalism, writing articles for local newspapers that criticized the Díaz regime. </p><p>Gustavo and his brother Francisco first became involved in politics in 1909, with the publication of Francisco's book "The Presidential Succession of 1910." The book called for free and fair elections in Mexico and criticized Díaz for his long tenure as president. This marked the beginning of the revolution, which aimed to overthrow the dictator and bring about democratic reforms in Mexico. </p><p>Gustavo played a pivotal role in the revolution, using his connections in the U.S. to secure financing and weapons for the rebels. He also helped recruit troops and coordinated logistics for rebel forces. Gustavo was present at the Battle of Ciudad Juárez in 1911, which saw the rebel army under Francisco's leadership defeat Díaz's forces and force him to resign.</p><p>After Díaz's ouster, Gustavo continued to work towards democratic reforms in Mexico. He was elected as a senator in 1912 and pushed for social and economic reforms, including land reform and workers' rights. However, his efforts were cut short when he was assassinated alongside his brother by generals opposed to their reformist agenda. </p><p>Today, Gustavo A. Madero is remembered as a hero of the Mexican Revolution and a symbol of the fight for democracy and social justice in Mexico. His legacy is commemorated in various ways, including through a municipality named after him in Chihuahua and a statue of him and his brother in Mexico City.</p><p>Gustavo A. Madero's assassination had far-reaching consequences for Mexico. His death paved the way for the rise of Victoriano Huerta, a general who took power through violent means and ruled the country with an iron fist. Huerta's regime was marked by widespread human rights abuses and political repression, which fueled further unrest and violence in the country. Gustavo's assassination also had personal implications for his family. His brother Francisco, who had been elected president after the revolution, was deposed and forced into exile by Huerta. Francisco would later be assassinated in 1917, further cementing the tragic fate of the Madero brothers. Despite these setbacks, the ideals and vision that Gustavo and Francisco A. Madero fought for live on in Mexico today, represented by a thriving civil society and a commitment to democracy and the rule of law.</p><p></p><p>
