(June 23, 1982		Saskatoon-May 13, 2011			Minneapolis)


was
a Canadian
ice hockey player.


					</p><p>Boogaard was known for his role as an enforcer, or "fighter," on the ice. He began his career playing in the Western Hockey League before being drafted by the Minnesota Wild in 2001. He played for the Wild for five seasons before signing with the New York Rangers in 2010. </p><p>Off the ice, Boogaard was known for his charitable work and was particularly involved in causes relating to children. Following his death, the Derek Boogaard Foundation was established to support organizations that focus on youth sports and provide support to families affected by addiction.</p><p>Boogaard's death brought attention to the issue of substance abuse and addiction among professional athletes. His brain was later donated to research and was found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease that has been linked to repeated head injuries such as those that occur in contact sports like hockey.</p><p>Boogaard's toughness on the ice made him a fan favorite and earned him the nickname "The Boogeyman." He was regarded as one of the toughest fighters in the NHL during his career, and his physical style of play was both feared and respected by opponents. Despite his reputation as a fighter, Boogaard was also a skilled player who had a soft touch around the net.</p><p>Off the ice, Boogaard was known as a gentle giant who was always willing to help those in need. He was involved in numerous charitable organizations, including the Children's Hospital in Minnesota, and was committed to making a positive impact on the lives of children.</p><p>Boogaard's death was a tragic loss for his family, friends, and fans. It also sparked a conversation about the dangers of substance abuse and addiction among professional athletes, and led to increased efforts to support players dealing with these issues. His legacy lives on through the work of the Derek Boogaard Foundation, which continues to support causes that were important to him.</p><p>Boogaard's death at the age of 28 shocked the hockey community and brought to light the serious consequences of repeated head injuries and substance abuse among athletes. In response to his passing, the NHL implemented new safety protocols and programs aimed at protecting players and preventing substance abuse. Boogaard's family also filed a lawsuit against the NHL, alleging that the league was negligent in its failure to address the risks associated with repeated head injuries. </p><p>Boogaard is survived by his parents and two brothers, one of whom, Aaron Boogaard, also played in the NHL. Despite his short life and tragic ending, Boogaard is remembered as a fierce competitor on the ice and a kind and caring person off of it, whose dedication to charitable causes and passion for the game of hockey will not be forgotten.</p><p>In addition to his charitable work, Boogaard was very close to his family, particularly his younger brother Aaron. The two brothers played together for two seasons in the Western Hockey League and were known for protecting each other on the ice. After Derek's death, Aaron struggled with his own substance abuse issues and eventually retired from professional hockey in order to focus on his recovery. Derek's death had a profound impact on Aaron and he has been open about his struggles in the hopes of helping others who may be dealing with addiction. The Boogaard brothers' story underscores the importance of mental health and support systems for athletes, as well as the need to address the issue of substance abuse in the sports world.</p><p></p><p>
