(April 5, 2015-March 30, 1977)


was
a Belgian
scientist.


					</p><p>He was a pioneering figure in the field of plasma physics and made significant contributions to the understanding of the behavior of gases in high-energy electric fields. Errera served as a professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles and was a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium. He also held multiple visiting professorships at universities around the world, including Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley. In addition to his work in plasma physics, Errera was also interested in the history of science and wrote several books on the topic. He passed away in 1977, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking research in his field.</p><p>Errera received his doctorate degree from the Université Libre de Bruxelles in 1928 and remained at the university for the rest of his career. He was a highly respected teacher and mentor, and many of his students went on to make significant contributions to the field of plasma physics. Errera's research focused on experimental studies of plasmas, and his work laid the foundation for future research in areas such as nuclear fusion and space physics. He was also awarded numerous honors for his work, including the Francqui Prize, one of the most prestigious scientific awards in Belgium. In addition to his scientific work, Errera was also active in promoting international scientific cooperation and played a key role in the establishment of the International Association of Physics of the Atmosphere.</p><p>Errera's contributions to the understanding of plasma physics were numerous. He conducted experiments that showed that plasmas can be created by striking a gas with an electric current, and he was the first to demonstrate the existence of a region of trapped electrons in a plasma, which is now known as the "Errera zone." His research on the behavior of plasma in magnetic fields was also groundbreaking, and it led to the development of the Tokamak, a device that uses a magnetic field to confine a plasma, which is now used in research on nuclear fusion. </p><p>Errera was also known for his work in the history of science. He was particularly interested in the work of Isaac Newton and wrote a number of books on the subject. He believed that it was important for scientists to have a deep understanding of the history of their field in order to appreciate the contributions of past generations and build upon their work. </p><p>Errera's influence on the field of plasma physics can still be felt today, and his contributions have been recognized with numerous awards and honors. In addition to the Francqui Prize, he received the Wolf Prize in Physics, the John Dawson Award, and the Royal Society of London's Hughes Medal. He was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of the American Physical Society.</p><p></p><p>
