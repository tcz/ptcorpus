(April 9, 1878		Budapest-September 7, 1936			Zürich)


was
a Hungarian
scientist and mathematician.


					</p><p>He is most notable for his collaboration with his friend and classmate, Albert Einstein, in developing the theory of general relativity. Grossmann assisted Einstein with the mathematical equations involved in the theory, and also introduced him to the concept of Riemannian geometry, which is crucial to understanding the curvature of space-time. In addition to his work on relativity, Grossmann also made important contributions to the field of differential geometry, and he was a professor of mathematics at the ETH Zurich for many years. During his lifetime, he received numerous honors and awards for his groundbreaking research in mathematics and physics.</p><p>Grossmann's interest in mathematics was sparked at a young age when he was gifted a book on geometry by his father. He went on to study mathematics and physics at the ETH Zurich, where he met Einstein. In addition to his work on general relativity, he also collaborated with Einstein on a paper on the geodesic equation. </p><p>Grossmann was not only a renowned mathematician and physicist but also an accomplished linguist. He was fluent in several languages, including Hungarian, German, French, Italian, and English. His multilingual abilities helped him to collaborate with scientists from different countries and to translate important scientific papers for his colleagues.</p><p>After his death, a crater on the moon was named in honor of Grossmann's contributions to science. His work on the theory of relativity has had a lasting impact on the field of physics and continues to be studied and applied today.</p><p>Grossmann was a dedicated family man, and he married a Swiss woman named Anna Winteler in 1909. Together, they had two children, a daughter named Maria and a son named Marcel Jr. Despite his success as a scientist, Grossmann faced difficulties during his lifetime due to anti-Semitism. He was initially denied a teaching position at the ETH Zurich because of his Jewish heritage, and he experienced discrimination throughout his career. However, he persisted in his work and continued to make significant contributions to the field of mathematics and physics. Today, he is remembered as a trailblazer in his field and a pioneering figure in the study of general relativity. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of mathematicians and scientists to pursue their passions and push the boundaries of knowledge.</p><p></p><p>

He served as the principal of Government College University, Lahore, and established the Oriental College in Lahore in 1876. He was also instrumental in the establishment of the Government College University's Law College. Leitner's contributions to education in India were pivotal, and his impact can still be seen in the country's education system today.</p><p>Leitner was born to a Hungarian Jewish family in Budapest and grew up speaking multiple languages. He was educated in Germany and later in England, where he studied at Cambridge University. He published his first book, a study of oriental languages, at the age of 25. </p><p>After working as a professor of Arabic and Islamic law at King's College London, Leitner took up a position as the principal of Government College University in Lahore, India (now Pakistan). While in Lahore, he established the University of the Punjab and founded the Oriental College, which quickly became a leading center for the study of Indian languages and cultures. Leitner was passionate about promoting education, particularly for women and religious minorities, and remained committed to these causes throughout his life.</p><p>Leitner returned to England in 1889 following a dispute with the British Indian authorities. He continued to write and publish extensively on linguistics and culture, particularly on the relationship between Islam and other religions. Despite his contributions, Leitner's work fell out of fashion in the twentieth century, and he is now mostly remembered for his role in the establishment of the Punjab University.</p><p>Leitner's linguistic abilities were extraordinary and he learned languages such as Arabic, Sanskrit, Urdu, Hindi, Persian, Punjabi, Pashto, Balochi, and Kashmiri to name a few. In addition to his linguistic and educational pursuits, Leitner was also a prolific writer and authored numerous books, including The History of Indigenous Education in the Punjab and Kashmir, Muhammadanism: Being a Sketch of the Life and Teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, and Dardistan in 1866, 1886 and 1893. </p><p>Aside from his academic achievements, Leitner's personal life was also marked by tragedy.

He was known for his anti-communist beliefs and was a member of the Independent Smallholders' Party. However, Miklós was arrested by the Hungarian communist government in 1948 and charged with conspiracy against the state.

He was a leading member of the Budapest Aid and Rescue Committee, which sought to save Hungarian Jews from deportation to concentration camps. Kastner famously negotiated with Eichmann to allow a train carrying more than 1,600 Jews to leave Hungary in exchange for money and other goods. This event, known as the Kastner train, has been a subject of much debate and criticism. After the war, Kastner immigrated to Israel where he became a prominent public figure. However, he was accused of collaborating with the Nazis during the war and was eventually assassinated by a right-wing extremist who believed that Kastner had betrayed his fellow Jews. Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, Kastner is still remembered as a complex and intriguing historical figure.</p><p>Rudolf Kastner was born into a Jewish family in Cluj-Napoca, Romania (then part of Hungary). He studied law at the University of Cluj and went on to become a prominent journalist and civil servant in Hungary. In the years leading up to World War II, Kastner became involved in various Zionist organizations and dedicated himself to helping Hungarian Jews escape persecution.</p><p>During the war, Kastner served as a key member of the Budapest Aid and Rescue Committee, which was responsible for saving tens of thousands of Jews from deportation to Nazi death camps. In 1944, he famously negotiated with Adolf Eichmann, one of the architects of the Holocaust, to allow a train carrying more than 1,600 Jews to leave Hungary in exchange for money and other goods. This controversial deal, known as the Kastner train affair, has been the subject of much historical analysis and debate.</p><p>After the war, Kastner immigrated to Israel with his family and settled in Haifa. He continued to work as a journalist and was soon appointed as a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Trade and Industry. In 1953, he published a book called "The Truth and Nothing But the Truth," in which he defended his actions during the war and refuted accusations of collaboration with the Nazis.</p><p>Despite his efforts to defend himself, Kastner remained a controversial figure in Israel. In 1955, he was accused in court of having collaborated with the Nazis during the war and of having traded Jewish lives for money and favors. Although he was eventually exonerated of most of the charges against him, the trial had a profound impact on his reputation and on Israeli public opinion.</p><p>In 1957, Kastner was assassinated outside his home in Tel Aviv by a right-wing extremist named Zeev Eckstein. The assassination sparked outrage and led to a national debate about Kastner's legacy and the nature of Israeli politics. Today, Kastner is remembered as a brave and controversial figure who dedicated his life to helping Jews in times of extreme danger and uncertainty.</p><p>In recent years, new documents have come to light that shed new light on Kastner's activities during the war. Some historians now believe that Kastner was much more involved in negotiations with the Nazis than he ever admitted, and that he may have collaborated with them in ways that he did not disclose. Despite this, there are many who still believe that Kastner was a hero who risked his life to save thousands of Jewish lives during one of the darkest periods in human history.</p><p>Kastner's legacy continues to be the subject of debate and controversy, both in Israel and around the world. Some view him as a complicated figure who operated in difficult circumstances, while others see him as a collaborator who put his own interests above those of his people. Regardless of one's perspective, it is clear that Rudolf Kastner was a significant historical figure who played an important role in the events of his time.</p><p></p><p>
