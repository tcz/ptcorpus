(March 8, 1911		Bahia-June 28, 1938			Sergipe)

	
		also known as Maria Déia

	
was
a Brazilian
personality.


					</p><p>She was the wife of a cangaceiro, or bandit, named Lampião and became a prominent member of his group, which terrorized the northeastern region of Brazil in the 1920s and 1930s. Maria Bonita became known as the "Queen of the Cangaceiros" and was admired for her beauty, courage, and loyalty to Lampião. She participated in several battles and raids alongside her husband and other members of the group. Eventually, in 1938, Maria Bonita and Lampião were killed in a police ambush, which marked the end of the cangaço era. Today, she is remembered as a symbol of resistance and female empowerment in Brazilian culture.</p><p>After her death, many songs and poems were written about Maria Bonita and her life as a cangaceira. Her story has been adapted into several films, including the 1982 movie "O Cangaceiro" directed by Anselmo Duarte. In recent years, she has also become a popular figure in Brazilian fashion, with several clothing and accessory lines inspired by her style. In 2020, Maria Bonita was posthumously awarded the Medalha do Mérito Cultural, Brazil's highest cultural honor. This recognition further cemented her legacy in Brazilian history and culture. Today, her story is still studied and celebrated for its insights into the cangaço era and the role of women in Brazilian history.</p><p>Maria Bonita's life and legacy continue to inspire and captivate Brazilians and people around the world. Her courage and strength in a male-dominated world have made her an icon of female empowerment and resistance to oppression. Many feminist movements in Brazil have looked to her as a symbol of women's rights and liberation. Her story has also been used as a symbol of the struggle for land reform and social justice, as the cangaço era was marked by a deep divide between the wealthy landowners and the poor rural population.</p><p>In addition to her cultural impact, Maria Bonita's death was also a turning point in Brazilian history. The government had long struggled to control the cangaço groups, which had become a powerful force in the northeast. With the killing of Lampião and Maria Bonita, the government was able to claim a victory over this band of bandits and their town-terrorizing ways. However, their legacy has endured, with many seeing them as a symbol of resistance against a corrupt and oppressive system.</p><p>Overall, Maria Bonita's life and death tell a fascinating story of struggle, resistance, and empowerment that continues to resonate with people today. Her legacy as a fighter for justice and equality is an enduring one, and she will always be remembered as one of the most remarkable figures of Brazilian history.</p><p></p><p>
