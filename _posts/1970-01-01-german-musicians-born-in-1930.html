(April 3, 1930		Ludwigshafen-)

	
		a.k.a. Helmut Josef Michael Kohl, Der Dicke, Birne or Dr. Helmut Kohl

	
is
a German
politician and historian.


					
			
		His children
		are
		called
		Walter Kohl and Peter Kohl.

							</p><p>Kohl served as Chancellor of Germany from 1982 to 1998, making him the longest-serving chancellor of the country in the post-World War II era. He is also widely regarded as the architect of German reunification which was completed in 1990. Kohl was a member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and his tenure as chancellor oversaw important changes in Germany's domestic policy, including the implementation of economic reforms, advancements in social welfare programs, and integration into the European Union. In addition to his political career, Kohl was also a scholar of modern history and a prolific writer.</p><p>Kohl was born on April 3rd, 1930, in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and grew up in a conservative, Catholic family. He studied history and political science at the University of Heidelberg and later earned his doctorate in history at the University of Frankfurt. Kohl began his political career in 1947 when he joined the CDU, serving in various local and regional positions before being elected to the national parliament in 1976. He was elected as the party leader in 1973, a position he held until his resignation in 2000.</p><p>During his time as chancellor, Kohl worked closely with other world leaders such as US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to help bring an end to the Cold War. He also negotiated the Treaty on European Union, which set the groundwork for deeper economic and political integration among European nations.</p><p>Kohl's personal life was marked by tragedy in 2001 when his wife, Hannelore Kohl, committed suicide after a long battle with a rare skin disease. Kohl himself suffered health issues later in life, including a serious head injury and a fall that left him wheelchair-bound. He died on June 16th, 2017, at the age of 87.</p><p>Kohl's tenure as chancellor was not without controversy, particularly in relation to his handling of the economic reunification of Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Critics argued that the cost of integrating the East German economy and social infrastructure placed a heavy burden on the West German economy, resulting in high unemployment and social instability in the years following reunification. However, supporters of Kohl's policies maintain that reunification was a necessary step in healing the divisions of the Cold War and promoting stability and prosperity for all Germans.</p><p>In his later years, Kohl remained active in politics and continued to advocate for a stronger, more united Europe. He was also actively involved in charitable causes, including the creation of the Kohl Foundation, which provides financial support to young researchers and scholars in the field of European integration. Despite his many accomplishments, Kohl's legacy remains somewhat controversial, with both admirers and critics recognizing his role as a transformative figure in German and European history.</p><p></p><p>
