Her activism in the Communist Party led to her becoming a target of government persecution, but she remained steadfast in her beliefs. During her imprisonment, she continued to write and even taught other prisoners how to read and write. Yang Kaihui's tragic death had a profound impact on Mao Zedong's life and his political views. He would later write extensively about her in his works and praise her for her loyalty to the Communist cause. Today, Yang Kaihui is remembered as a symbol of the sacrifices made by Communist revolutionaries and a feminist icon in Chinese history.</p><p>Yang Kaihui was not only a devoted wife and mother, but also a committed political activist. She played an active role in the Communist movement across China during a time when women's voices were often silenced in political circles. Yang Kaihui faced great adversity, including family disapproval for her political beliefs and frequent arrests by government officials. Despite these challenges, she remained resolute in her commitment to the Communist cause, even providing shelter for other activists in her home. Yang Kaihui's life and death continue to inspire generations of Chinese citizens to fight for social justice and political change.
