was
a Dutch
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>De Haan was a member of the Amsterdam Impressionism movement and is known for his paintings and drawings of landscapes, portraits, and scenes of daily life. He studied at the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten in Amsterdam under painter August Allebé, and later studied at the Académie Julian in Paris where he was influenced by the work of Vincent van Gogh. De Haan eventually became friends with van Gogh and the two artists would paint together in Paris. In addition to his artistic pursuits, De Haan was also involved in social activism, often depicting themes related to social justice in his art. Despite his relatively short career, De Haan's works have been featured in major exhibitions and are highly regarded in the art world.</p><p>De Haan's style evolved throughout his career, with his early works being characterized by dark tones and heavy, somber subjects. However, in later years, he experimented with brighter colors and bold brushstrokes, which can be seen in paintings such as "The Red Vineyard" and "The Bridge at Chatou". De Haan suffered from mental illness throughout his life, and his struggles can be seen in many of his works, which often feature distorted figures and dark, brooding landscapes. Despite this, he continued to create until his untimely death at the age of 43. Today, De Haan's legacy lives on through his art, which continues to inspire and captivate audiences around the world.</p><p></p><p>
