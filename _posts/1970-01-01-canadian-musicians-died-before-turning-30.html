He was also an accomplished amateur pilot, and it was his passion for flying that ultimately led to his tragic death. On August 26, 1951, Barilko and a friend embarked on a fishing trip aboard a small plane. The plane never returned, and an extensive search was launched to find it. Despite several attempts, no trace of the plane or its passengers was found until 11 years later when a helicopter pilot discovered the wreckage in the dense forest near Cochrane, Ontario. </p><p>Barilko's untimely death sparked an outpouring of grief from fans across Canada, and his legacy has continued to inspire a new generation of hockey players.

His story has become an important part of Canadian folklore, and his Stanley Cup-winning goal remains one of the most iconic moments in NHL history.</p><p>Barilko's disappearance for 11 years also influenced Canadian singer-songwriter Gord Downie, who wrote a song about him called "Fifty Mission Cap" while fronting the band, The Tragically Hip. The song was based on a conversation Downie had with his friend, hockey historian Bill Fitsell, about Barilko's story. The Tragically Hip's song brought Barilko's story to a wider audience in Canada and is now considered one of the band's most iconic songs. The song even helped solve the mystery of Barilko's death as it led to a search for the wreckage in the location described in the song's lyrics.
