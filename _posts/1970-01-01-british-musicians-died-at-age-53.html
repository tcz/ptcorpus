(June 18, 1769		Dublin-August 12, 1822			Loring Hall)


was
a British
politician.


					</p><p>Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, was an influential British political leader who played a key role in shaping European diplomacy during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was a skilled statesman who served as the British Foreign Secretary from 1812 until his death, and played a key role in the eventual defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815. Castlereagh was also a staunch supporter of the Union between Great Britain and Ireland, and was instrumental in the passing of the Act of Union in 1800. Although he was widely admired for his political acumen and diplomatic skills, Castlereagh's mental health had long been a source of concern, and he tragically died by suicide in 1822. Despite his untimely death, his legacy as a statesman and diplomat continues to be felt in international relations to this day.</p><p>Castlereagh was born into a wealthy family in Dublin and was educated at Cambridge University. He entered politics at an early age and was first elected to the Irish parliament in 1790. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled orator and political strategist, and was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1798.</p><p>As Chief Secretary, Castlereagh was responsible for suppressing the Irish Rebellion of 1798, a traumatic period in Irish history marked by widespread violence and bloodshed. Despite his controversial role in the suppression of the rebellion, he continued to rise through the ranks of British politics and was eventually appointed Foreign Secretary in 1812.</p><p>As Foreign Secretary, Castlereagh played a crucial role in the Congress of Vienna, a series of meetings held in 1815 to reorganize Europe after the chaotic period of the Napoleonic Wars. His skillful diplomacy helped to secure a lasting peace in Europe and to establish a new order based on the principles of balance of power and legitimacy.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Castlereagh's mental health had long been a source of concern. He suffered from depression and anxiety, and had attempted suicide on at least one occasion before his death in 1822. His suicide came as a shock to many of his contemporaries, who praised him as a brilliant statesman and diplomat.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by suicide.
