						</p><p>He was a prolific figure in the Cambodian film industry and is widely regarded as one of its pioneers. Born to a family of musicians, Tioulong grew up with a strong passion for the arts. He began his career as a screenwriter in the late 1950s, penning scripts for some of the most successful Cambodian films of the time. In the late 1960s, he transitioned to acting and went on to appear in several critically acclaimed movies. Tioulong also directed a number of popular television shows, including the long-running series "Romdoul Chet," which focused on the lives of everyday Cambodians.
