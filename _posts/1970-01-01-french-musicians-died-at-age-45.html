(February 17, 1781		Quimper-August 13, 1826			Kerlouan)

	
		also known as Rene Laennec, René-Théophile-Hyacinthe Laennec or Rene-Theophile-Hyacinthe Laennec

	
was
a French
physician.


					</p><p>Laennec is best known for his invention of the stethoscope, which revolutionized the practice of auscultation (listening to sounds made inside the body, often through a stethoscope) in medicine. He also made important contributions to the understanding of tuberculosis, including the development of a diagnostic test for the disease. Laennec was a prominent figure in the medical community, and his work helped to establish the field of clinical medicine.</p><p>Laennec initially pursued a career in law before turning to medicine, inspired by his uncle who was a physician. He earned his medical degree in 1804, and soon after began working at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris. It was there that he developed the first stethoscope, which he described as a "hollow cylinder" made of wood, and used it to listen to the heart and lungs of his patients. This invention allowed doctors to better diagnose and treat various illnesses, and it quickly became an essential tool in medicine.</p><p>In addition to his work on tuberculosis and the stethoscope, Laennec was also a pioneer in the field of obstetrics, and wrote extensively on topics such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and diphtheria. He was widely respected for his diagnostic abilities and his contributions to medical education.</p><p>Laennec's legacy continues to be felt in modern medicine, where the stethoscope is still a fundamental tool used in diagnosing and treating patients. He is considered one of the most important figures in the history of medicine, and his work laid the foundation for many of the diagnostic and treatment techniques still in use today.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by tuberculosis.

(March 7, 1936		Paris-March 3, 1982			Ivry-sur-Seine)


was
a French
novelist, essayist, writer and filmmaker.


					</p><p>Perec was a member of the Oulipo group, a literary movement that aimed to create works using constrained writing techniques, such as lipograms and palindromes. He is best known for his novel "Life: A User's Manual," which tells the story of the inhabitants of a Paris apartment building and their interconnected lives. </p><p>Perec's work often explores themes of memory, identity, and language. He also wrote extensively on the topic of imaginary worlds and was particularly interested in the writing of science fiction. Additionally, Perec was a prolific crossword puzzle solver and constructed many puzzles himself. </p><p>Despite struggling with depression for much of his life, Perec continued to produce innovative and influential works until his untimely death at the age of 45. Today, he is remembered as one of France's most important writers and a pioneering experimental novelist.</p><p>Born to Polish Jewish immigrant parents, Perec's father died fighting in World War II and his mother perished in the Holocaust. As a result, Perec was raised by his aunt and uncle. He studied history and sociology at the Sorbonne and worked as a researcher for the National Scientific Research Center. Perec's debut novel, "Things: A Story of the Sixties," earned critical acclaim and won the Prix Renaudot in 1965. Later, he received the Prix Médicis for his novel "A Void," a 300-page lipogram written without using the letter "e."</p><p>In addition to his novels, Perec wrote several books on society and culture, including "Species of Spaces and Other Pieces" and "The Infra-World." He also collaborated with filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard on the script for the film "One Plus One," which explored the relationship between art, politics, and the counterculture movement of the 1960s.</p><p>Perec's legacy continues to influence contemporary literature and writers. His use of experimental writing techniques and his exploration of complex themes have earned him a distinguished reputation among literary scholars and readers alike. Among his most famous quotes is: "To be a writer means to make use of language. But to be a writer also means to be somebody who has learnt to appreciate the importance of language, and who can take pleasure in manipulating it."</p><p></p><p>

(July 6, 1796		Les Pontets-February 4, 1842			Paris)

	
		also known as Theodore Simon Jouffroy

	
was
a French
philosopher.


					</p><p>Jouffroy was a student of Victor Cousin and became one of the leading proponents of the Scottish school of common sense philosophy in France. He taught at the École Normale Supérieure, where he was appointed as a professor in 1830. He was also a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. Jouffroy believed that philosophy should be practical and focused on issues that concerned human experience. He was particularly interested in the nature of the self and the problems of free-will and determinism. A major work of his was "Introduction to Ethics" (1833), which sought to establish a system of ethics based on reason and sympathy. Jouffroy died at a relatively young age of tuberculosis in 1842, but his ideas continued to influence French philosophical thought through the latter half of the 19th century.</p><p>Jouffroy's interest in practical philosophy led him to apply philosophical theories to social and political issues. He was an advocate of constitutional monarchy, arguing that it provided a balance between individual liberty and political stability. In addition to his philosophical pursuits, Jouffroy was also an art critic and wrote extensively on aesthetics. He was a strong believer in the ability of art to improve the human condition and enhance human experience. Jouffroy's humanistic philosophy and belief in the practical application of knowledge made him a popular teacher and mentor, influencing many students who went on to become prominent philosophers in their own right. His commitment to bridging the gap between theory and practice and to making philosophy accessible to all was a defining characteristic of his work.</p><p></p><p>

(August 19, 1848		Paris-February 21, 1894			Gennevilliers)


was
a French
artist, painter and visual artist.


					</p><p>He was born into a wealthy family and initially enrolled in law school but later dropped out to pursue a career in art. Caillebotte was one of the key figures of the Impressionist movement and was particularly interested in depicting urban life, industrial scenes, and everyday people. His most famous works include "Paris Street; Rainy Day" and "The Floor Scrapers," which showcase his unique perspective and attention to detail. In addition to his work as a painter, Caillebotte was also a significant art collector, and his collection included works by fellow Impressionists such as Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Despite his contributions to the art world, Caillebotte's work was not always well-received during his lifetime, and it wasn't until after his death that he was truly recognized as a talented artist.</p><p>Caillebotte was known for his use of thick brushstrokes and his ability to capture the mood and atmosphere of his scenes. He also experimented with unusual compositions and perspectives, often using elevated positions to capture the action below. Caillebotte was heavily influenced by photography, which he used as a reference for his paintings, often cropping and framing his subjects in a similar way to photographic images. In addition to his paintings, Caillebotte also produced a number of sculptures and was a founding member of the Society of Independent Artists, which aimed to promote artistic freedom and challenge traditional methods of artistic exhibition. Today, Caillebotte's work is celebrated for its unique style and its insights into life in late 19th-century France.</p><p></p><p>
