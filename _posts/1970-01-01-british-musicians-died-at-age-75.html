(July 20, 1766		Fife-November 14, 1841)


was
a British
diplomat.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin.

						</p><p>Thomas Bruce, also known as Lord Elgin, is perhaps best known for his controversial removal of sculptures from the Parthenon temple in Athens, Greece. As the British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople, Elgin convinced Ottoman authorities to allow him to remove these sculptures, which became known as the "Elgin Marbles," and ship them to England. The move was widely criticized, and Greece continues to call for the return of these cultural treasures to this day. Elgin served as Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799-1803 and later held various political positions in Britain. In addition to his political career, Elgin was also a noted art collector and patron.</p><p>Elgin's interest in art began during his time as a student at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, where he spent much of his time studying ancient Greek and Roman texts. He later traveled extensively throughout Europe, collecting art and antiquities from various sources. Elgin's actions in Greece were part of a larger trend of European imperialism and cultural appropriation during the 19th century, which saw many important cultural artifacts removed from their places of origin and brought to European museums and collections. Despite the controversy surrounding his actions, Elgin remained a prominent figure in British society until his death in 1841. Today, his legacy is somewhat mixed, with some regarding him as a cultural hero who helped preserve ancient Greek art, while others view him as a villain who stole important pieces of Greece's cultural heritage.</p><p></p><p>

was
a British
mathematician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on finite groups, specifically the Burnside's theorem. Burnside made significant contributions to the field of group theory and was a Fellow of the Royal Society. He also served as the president of the London Mathematical Society from 1902 to 1904. In addition to his mathematical achievements, Burnside was also a prolific writer, having authored several textbooks on the subject. He was appointed the first professor of mathematics at the University of Bristol in 1909 and held the position until his retirement in 1919. Burnside's legacy continues to be felt in the field of mathematics and his contributions have been recognized by numerous honors and awards.</p><p>Burnside was born into a family of lawyers and was initially expected to follow in his father's footsteps. However, he showed a strong interest in mathematics from a young age and pursued the subject throughout his education. After completing his undergraduate degree at Trinity College, Cambridge, Burnside went on to earn his PhD from the University of GÃ¶ttingen in Germany. He returned to Cambridge to teach mathematics and became a fellow of the college in 1878.</p><p>Burnside's research focused primarily on group theory, a branch of abstract algebra that studies the properties of mathematical groups. He made several important discoveries in the field, including Burnside's lemma and the Burnside basis theorem. However, his most significant contribution was Burnside's theorem, which states that a finite group in which the order of every element is a factorial is solvable. This theorem has been widely used in the study of finite groups and has applications in areas such as chemistry and physics.</p><p>In addition to his academic work, Burnside was also involved in public service. He was a member of the Royal Commission on University Education in Ireland and served on the Board of Education in England. He was awarded the Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1917 in recognition of his contributions to education.</p><p>Burnside's influence on mathematics has been immense, and his work continues to be studied and applied by mathematicians today. His contributions to the field have earned him a place among the most important mathematicians of the 20th century.</p><p></p><p>

He also identified patterns in mortality and morbidity, highlighting seasonal and geographical variations, and pioneered the use of graphical methods, such as the life table, for analyzing data. Farr's work had a profound impact on public health policy and practice in Britain and around the world. After his death, Farr was largely forgotten for decades, but his contributions were rediscovered in the 20th century, and today, he is widely recognized as a major figure in the history of public health and epidemiology.</p><p>In addition to his work on vital statistics, William Farr made important contributions to the field of occupational health, investigating whether certain jobs led to an increased risk of disease or death. He also studied the impact of overcrowding on the incidence of infectious diseases, and advocated for measures to improve sanitation and living conditions in crowded urban areas. Farr was a prolific writer, publishing numerous articles and books on public health and statistics, including a landmark report on the causes of death in England in the mid 19th century.
