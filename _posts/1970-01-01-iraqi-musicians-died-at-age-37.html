(May 17, 1966		Baghdad-July 22, 2003			Mosul)

	
		also known as Qusay Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti, قصي صدام حسين, Qusai or Qusay Saddam Hussein

	
was

		He had
		three

						</p><p>Qusay Hussein was the second son of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and was considered to be his father's heir apparent. He held several high-ranking positions in the Iraqi government and military, and was responsible for suppressing the 1991 uprisings against his father's regime. He was also known for his involvement in the execution of political dissidents and the torture of prisoners.</p><p>After the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Qusay went into hiding with his father and older brother Uday. However, they were eventually located by American forces and engaged in a firefight in Mosul. Qusay and Uday died in the battle, along with their bodyguards. </p><p>Qusay's death marked a major milestone in the Iraq War, as it effectively ended the Hussein family's rule over Iraq.</p><p>Qusay's rise to power began in the late 1990s, when he was appointed head of the Iraqi Intelligence Service. This position gave him immense power over the country's security forces and intelligence agencies. His brutal tactics in suppressing dissent earned him a reputation as one of the most feared men in Iraq.</p><p>Despite his ruthless reputation, Qusay was also known for his charm and affability. He was a commanding presence in public, and was often seen as the public face of the Hussein regime. He was known for his love of luxury, and was rumored to own several villas and luxury cars.</p><p>Qusay's death was a significant blow to the Hussein family's hold on power. With both him and Uday dead, Saddam was left without any heir apparent, and his regime began to crumble. The subsequent fall of the Hussein regime led to a long and tumultuous period of instability in Iraq, with ongoing sectarian violence and political upheaval.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in firearm.
