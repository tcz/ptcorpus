					</p><p>Avraham Stern was actually a Zionist leader and founder of the militant Zionist organization, Lehi, which was also known as the Stern Gang. He was born in Suwalki, a town in Poland, and grew up in the British Mandate of Palestine. In 1929, he joined the Irgun, another Jewish militant group, but later broke away to form Lehi in 1940. </p><p>Lehi aimed to drive the British out of Palestine and establish a Jewish state. This put them at odds with other Jewish groups who believed in non-violent resistance. The group was responsible for a number of deadly attacks on British officials and soldiers, including the assassination of Lord Moyne, the British Minister of State for the Middle East, in Cairo in 1944. </p><p>Stern himself was killed by British forces in 1942, while hiding out in a Tel Aviv apartment. Despite his controversial actions, Stern is still remembered as a hero by some in Israel for his unwavering dedication to the cause of Jewish statehood.</p><p></p><p>

However, the party was banned in Israel in 1994 due to its extremist views and violent activities. </p><p>Despite the ban, Binyamin remained active in Israeli politics and continued to push for Jewish settlements in the West Bank. He was a prominent figure in the movement to establish a Jewish presence in the city of Hebron, which had been under Arab control since 1967. </p><p>Binyamin's death came as a shock to many Israelis, as he was seen as a strong figure in the far-right movement.
