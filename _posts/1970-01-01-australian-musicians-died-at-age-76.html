									</h1><p>Here are 21 famous musicians from Australia died at 76:</p><h2>John Kerr</h2><p><strong>John Kerr</strong>
(September 24, 1914		Balmain-March 24, 1991			Sydney)

	
		a.k.a. Sir John Robert Kerr or Judge John Kerr

	
was
an Australian
judge.


					</p><p>He served as the 18th Governor-General of Australia, from 1974 to 1977. Kerr was educated at the University of Sydney and later attended the United Kingdom's University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Throughout his career, he served as a judge in several courts, including the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Federal Court of Australia. Kerr gained international attention in 1975 when he dismissed the Labor government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, a move that was controversial and led to Kerr's resignation from the Bench two years later. Despite the controversy, Kerr continued to hold positions of authority, including serving as Chancellor of the Order of Australia from 1977 until his death in 1991.</p><p>Kerr's controversial decision to dismiss Whitlam's government came after a political stalemate between the government and the Senate, which had blocked the government's budget twice. Kerr ultimately used his powers as governor-general to dismiss the government and appoint opposition leader Malcolm Fraser as caretaker prime minister until new elections could be held. The move was met with widespread protests and accusations of betrayal from those who supported the Whitlam government. Kerr maintained that he acted legally and in the best interests of the country.</p><p>After his term as governor-general, Kerr faced public backlash and criticism, with some accusing him of being a pawn of the conservative establishment. He largely withdrew from public life, but continued to serve on various boards and committees, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Australian Opera.</p><p>Kerr's legacy remains controversial and debated to this day, with opinions split on whether he acted within his constitutional powers or overstepped them. Despite this, his career as a judge and governor-general demonstrated his commitment to public service and the legal system, and he remains a significant figure in Australian history.</p><p></p><p>
