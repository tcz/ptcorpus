a Chinese
personality.


					</p><p>She was the first wife of Mao Zedong, the founding father of the People's Republic of China. Luo Yixiu was born in a family of farmers and had limited education. She met Mao Zedong when she was 16 years old and married him in 1907. The couple lived together in Shaoshan, Hunan Province and had three children, but only one survived. Luo Yixiu died at the young age of 20 due to the lack of medical care in rural China at that time.
