(October 13, 1838		San Pedro de Atacama-March 23, 1879)


was
a Bolivian
personality.


					</p><p>He became a crucial figure during the War of the Pacific, where he led the Bolivian troops in several important battles against Chile. Abaroa is particularly remembered for his heroic defense during the Battle of Calama in 1879, where he and his small group of soldiers held off a much larger Chilean force for several hours before he was ultimately killed in action. The Battle of Calama is still celebrated annually in Bolivia as a symbol of the country's patriotic resistance against Chile. Today, Abaroa continues to be recognized as a national hero in Bolivia, with numerous institutions, monuments, and public spaces named after him.</p><p>Abaroa was born in San Pedro de Atacama, which was at the time part of Bolivia. He received his education in Valpara√≠so, Chile, and later joined the Bolivian army as a lieutenant. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a commander during the War of the Pacific.</p><p>In addition to his military achievements, Abaroa was also a prominent political figure in Bolivia. He was a member of the Liberal Party and served as mayor of La Paz for a brief period before the outbreak of the war.</p><p>After his death, Abaroa's heroic sacrifice became a rallying cry for Bolivian nationalism and anti-Chilean sentiment. His famous last words, "Before I surrender my position, I will have my head cut off," have become a symbol of national defiance.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to Bolivia, Abaroa has been honored with numerous monuments and memorials, including the Eduardo Abaroa Bolivian Andean Fauna National Reserve, which was named after him in 1973. He is also remembered through various cultural references, including a Bolivian folk song titled "Marcha de Abaroa," which celebrates his bravery on the battlefield.</p><p>In addition to his military and political accomplishments, Eduardo Abaroa was also known for his commitment to education. He founded a school in La Paz that would later become the prestigious Abaroa School, which is still in operation today. Abaroa was also a prolific writer and poet, and his works continue to be celebrated in Bolivia's literary community. His poetry often expressed his love for his country and his commitment to its independence and sovereignty.</p><p>Despite his heroic sacrifice, Abaroa's legacy has been a subject of controversy in recent years. Some historians have questioned the accuracy of his portrayal as a purely patriotic figure, pointing out his association with the conservative government and his involvement in the exploitation of indigenous communities. However, Abaroa's iconic status remains intact in the eyes of many Bolivians, who continue to honor his memory as a symbol of their country's resistance against foreign aggression.</p><p></p><p>
