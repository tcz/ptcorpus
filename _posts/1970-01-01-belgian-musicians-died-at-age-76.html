(March 9, 1852		Liège-January 26, 1929)


was
a Belgian
scientist and mathematician.


					</p><p>He became a professor of astronomy and theoretical physics at Ghent University in Belgium in 1878, and later served as director of the Observatory of Uccle from 1900 to 1920. During his career, Le Paige contributed greatly to the study of astrophysics, including his research on optics, the solar corona, and the motion of stars. He also made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in the area of differential equations. One of his most notable achievements was the development of the Le Paige series, a method for solving differential equations that has important applications in physics and engineering. Le Paige was widely respected for his work and received numerous accolades, including election to the Royal Academy of Belgium and the award of the Valz Prize by the French Academy of Sciences.</p><p>In addition to his scientific work, Le Paige was also a dedicated teacher and mentor to many students throughout his career. He believed strongly in the importance of education and worked tirelessly to promote the study of mathematics and science. Le Paige authored several books and numerous scientific papers during his lifetime, and his work continues to influence researchers and scientists today. Despite his many contributions to the field of astrophysics and mathematics, Le Paige remained humble and dedicated to further research throughout his life. He is widely regarded as one of the most important scientists in Belgian history, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of scholars and researchers.</p><p>Le Paige was born in Liège, Belgium where he attended university before starting his career in academia. He continued his studies at the University of Paris where he earned his doctorate in mathematics and astronomy. In addition to his work in academia, Le Paige was also an active member of the scientific community, serving as the president of the Belgian Academy of Sciences from 1924 to 1926. He was a prolific writer and authored over 100 scientific papers during his career. In recognition of his many achievements, Le Paige was awarded the degree of Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Ghent in 1922. The asteroid 780 Garulia, discovered in 1914 by Eugène Joseph Delporte at Uccle, was named in his honor.

(August 23, 1868		Brussels-December 10, 1944			Brussels)


was
a Belgian
scientist and librarian.


					</p><p>He is known for his pioneering work in information science and documentation. Otlet co-founded the International Institute of Bibliography (which later became the International Federation for Information and Documentation) and created the Universal Decimal Classification system to organize knowledge. He also envisioned a "televised book" called the "telegraphie" that would allow people to access information remotely, which can be considered an early concept of the World Wide Web. Otlet's work laid the foundation for many modern information technologies and continues to influence the development of information science today.</p><p>Throughout his career, Otlet was a prolific author and lecturer, publishing extensively on the topics of bibliographic organization and documentation. He was a passionate advocate for the democratization of knowledge and the use of technology to achieve this goal.</p><p>In addition to his work in information science, Otlet was also active in various social and political movements. He was a supporter of pacifism and internationalism, and he was involved in the founding of the League of Nations. During World War II, he and his family were forced to flee their home in Brussels due to the German occupation.</p><p>Despite facing many obstacles and setbacks throughout his life, Otlet's contributions to the field of information science have had a lasting impact. His ideas and innovations have influenced the development of modern technologies like the internet and the world of online information that we take for granted today.</p><p>Otlet began his career as a lawyer but quickly realized his true passion was in the world of libraries and information science. Alongside his co-founder Henri La Fontaine, he created the Universal Bibliographic Repertory, a catalog of books that aimed to collect bibliographic data from around the world. This led to the creation of the International Institute of Bibliography in 1895, which became the central hub of Otlet's work in information science.</p><p>One of Otlet's most notable accomplishments was the creation of the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) system. This system used a hierarchy of decimal numbers to classify all areas of human knowledge, allowing for easy organization and retrieval of information. The UDC is still used in libraries and other institutions around the world today.</p><p>In addition to his work in information science, Otlet was also an advocate for peace and international cooperation. He believed that the sharing of knowledge and culture could help prevent war and promote understanding between nations. In 1910, he founded the International Institute of Peace, which later became the International Peace Bureau.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Otlet's work fell out of favor during his lifetime and was largely forgotten after his death. It wasn't until the 1960s that his contributions to the field of information science were rediscovered and he was recognized as a visionary ahead of his time. Today, he is celebrated as one of the pioneers of modern information science and his ideas continue to inspire new advances in the field.</p><p></p><p>

He served as president of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Belgium from 1959 to 1960. Heymans' contributions to science have made a lasting impact on our understanding of the human body and its function.</p><p>In addition to his scientific achievements, Heymans was also a talented athlete, having competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics as a cyclist. He was also an accomplished painter and musician, playing the violin and piano. Heymans received numerous honors throughout his lifetime, including the Francqui Prize, the highest scientific honor in Belgium, and was made a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He continued his scientific work until his death in 1968, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking research and innovation.</p><p>Heymans was born into a family of scientists, with his father, brother, and uncle also being renowned scholars. He began his academic journey at Ghent University, where he studied medicine and physiology. From there, he pursued further studies at various institutions across Europe, including in Germany, France, and Spain. Heymans' scientific career began in earnest after he assumed the position of professor of pharmacology at Ghent University in 1922, a role he held until his retirement in 1962. In addition to his groundbreaking work on respiration, Heymans made significant contributions to the fields of physiology, endocrinology, and neurology.</p><p>During World War II, Heymans became involved in the resistance movement against the Nazi occupation of Belgium, risking his life to help smuggle Jewish scientists and their families out of the country. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Gestapo in 1944 but managed to survive and continue his scientific work after the war.</p><p>Heymans' legacy lives on through the Corneille Heymans Institute for Physiological Research at Ghent University, named in his honor. The institute continues to be at the forefront of research on the respiratory system and other areas of physiology.</p><p></p><p>

Furthermore, Empain was a major investor in the Belgian Congo, where he owned a large rubber plantation and mining interests. He was also an avid adventurer and traveler, visiting remote parts of the world such as Tibet and the Amazon rainforest. Despite his wealth and success, Empain was known for his humility and kindness, and was beloved by many who knew him. After his death, his legacy lived on through the many institutions and projects he founded, as well as through the numerous works of art he collected throughout his life.</p><p>In addition to his philanthropic work and business ventures, Baron Empain was also a devoted family man. He married Marie-Louise Solvay, the daughter of a prominent Belgian industrialist, and together they had six children. Their eldest son, Jean Empain, would go on to become a noted physicist and Vice President of the European Commission.</p><p>In his later years, Empain suffered from ill health and spent much of his time in seclusion. He continued to travel, however, and his journeys to exotic locales such as India and Africa were often chronicled in the press. He passed away in 1929 at the age of 76, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire and intrigue people to this day.
