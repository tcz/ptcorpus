(November 27, 1948		Bad Oldesloe-)


is
a German
, .


						</p><p>Isa Genzken is a German artist known for her sculptures, installations, and collages. She studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Hamburg and later at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where she was influenced by the teachings of Joseph Beuys. In her work, Genzken explores themes related to architecture, design, and consumer culture, often incorporating found objects and materials.</p><p>Genzken's work has been exhibited internationally, including at Documenta in Kassel, Germany, and in major museums such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate Modern in London. She was awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 2007 for her body of work. Today, she is considered one of the most influential artists of her generation.</p><p>Genzken's sculptures show a particular interest in how architecture shapes human behavior and society. Her use of materials such as mirrors, neon lights, and metal creates works that are both reflective and interactive. In recent years, she expanded her practice into the realm of film, creating experimental films that explore the relationship between the moving image and our perception of reality. In addition to her art practice, Genzken is also a respected teacher and mentor, having taught at various art schools in Germany, including the Städelschule in Frankfurt. She continues to live and work in Berlin, where she maintains a studio that is known for its vibrant and collaborative atmosphere.</p><p>Genzken's artistic career spans over four decades, and her work has undergone various phases and transformations. In the 1980s, she created abstract sculptures that explored geometrical shapes and the language of form. During the 1990s, her work became more political and critical of consumer culture, particularly the impact of globalization on urban landscapes. Her installations during this period often featured replicas of modern buildings or skyscrapers, which she used to comment on themes such as power, identity, and social inequality.</p><p>In recent years, Genzken has returned to her interest in architecture and the built environment. She has created large-scale sculptures that replicate fragments or sections of buildings, such as façades, windows or balconies. These works are often fragmented or distorted, suggesting a sense of disorientation or instability. Her more recent sculptures have incorporated new materials such as concrete, wood, and fiberglass, and explore themes such as urban decay and the relationship between nature and technology.</p><p>In addition to her art practice, Genzken is also a respected teacher and mentor, having taught at various art schools in Germany, including the Städelschule in Frankfurt. She continues to live and work in Berlin, where she maintains a studio that is known for its vibrant and collaborative atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>

Karoli's playing style was also heavily influenced by Jimi Hendrix and he was known to incorporate elements of blues and psychedelic rock into his playing.</p><p>Karoli's guitar work was an integral part of Can's sound and helped to establish the band as one of the most innovative and influential acts of the 1970s.
