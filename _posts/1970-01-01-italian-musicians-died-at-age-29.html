(February 15, 1904		Macerata-November 9, 1933			Arco)


was
an Italian
personality.


					</p><p>Born into a noble family, Scipione had a passion for adventure since his childhood. He was an avid mountaineer and explorer, and also had a deep interest in archaeology. In 1928, Scipione led an expedition to Ethiopia which resulted in the discovery and excavation of ancient tombs, earning him worldwide recognition. He also served as the Italian consul in Syria and Lebanon, where he continued to explore and study the region's history and culture. </p><p>Despite his achievements, Scipione's life was cut short when he died in a plane crash while on a solo flight from Rome to Arco. His legacy lives on, however, as he is remembered not only for his contributions to archaeology and exploration, but also for his fearless spirit and commitment to adventure.</p><p>Following Scipione's death, a number of monuments and memorials were built to honor his legacy, including the Scipione Memorial in Arco, Italy, which was erected in 1934. In addition to his archaeological and exploratory work, Scipione was also a talented writer and photographer. During his travels, he often wrote and took photographs for various publications, documenting his experiences and the places he visited. Some of his photographs and writings are still published and studied today. Scipione was a true pioneer in his field and his contributions continue to inspire and inform scholars and enthusiasts alike.</p><p>Scipione's interest in mountaineering began at a young age, and he would often spend his summers climbing in the Dolomites. In 1925, he made the first ascent of the north face of the Marmolada, the highest peak in the Dolomites. This climb was considered a remarkable achievement at the time, and helped establish Scipione as one of Italy's most promising young mountaineers.</p><p>In addition to his archaeological work in Ethiopia, Scipione also conducted excavations in Syria and Lebanon, where he uncovered a number of important artifacts from various periods of history. His knowledge of the region's history and culture made him a valuable asset as the Italian consul, a position he held from 1929 until his death in 1933.</p><p>Scipione's death was a tragedy for the world of exploration and archaeology. At the time of his death, he was only 29 years old and had accomplished more than many people do in a lifetime. Despite his short career, Scipione's contributions helped expand our knowledge of the ancient world and inspired generations of adventurers and explorers.</p><p></p><p>
