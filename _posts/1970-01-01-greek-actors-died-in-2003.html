							</p><p>
							Kazan is considered one of the most influential and pioneering figures in American theatre and cinema. He co-founded the influential Actors Studio in 1947, which revolutionized acting by emphasizing Method Acting and psychological realism. Kazan's early career in theatre included directing plays written by Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, both of whom he would later collaborate with in films. </p><p>Kazan's first film as a director was "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" (1945), followed by "Gentleman's Agreement" (1947) and "A Streetcar Named Desire" (1951), all of which earned him Academy Award nominations. He won two Oscars for Best Director, for "Gentleman's Agreement" and "On the Waterfront" (1954), which starred Marlon Brando in what is widely considered one of the greatest performances in film history. </p><p>Kazan's legacy is marred by his controversial testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952, during which he named names of suspected Communist sympathizers in the entertainment industry. This decision led to a lifelong rift between Kazan and many of his former colleagues and friends, who saw his actions as betrayal and opportunism.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=42874" title="Wikipedia article about Elia Kazan">Elia Kazan on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/polish-actresses-died-in-1981.html' title='Polish actresses died in 1981'><strong>Polish actresses died in 1981</strong> List of the top 1 Polish actresses who died in 1981</a></li><li><a href='/english-actresses-died-in-stroke.html' title='English actresses died in Stroke'><strong>English actresses died in Stroke</strong> List of the top 10 English actresses who died in Stroke</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actresses-died-in-colorectal-cancer.html' title='Indian actresses died in Colorectal cancer'><strong>Indian actresses died in Colorectal cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Indian actresses who died in Colorectal cancer</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/west-german-actresses-died-in-2012.html' title='West German actresses died in 2012'><strong>West German actresses died in 2012</strong> List of the top 1 West German actresses who died in 2012</a></li><li><a href='/egyptian-actors-died-in-2006.html' title='Egyptian actors died in 2006'><strong>Egyptian actors died in 2006</strong> List of the top 1 Egyptian actors who died in 2006</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-lung-infection.html' title='Famous musicians died in Lung Infection'><strong>Famous musicians died in Lung Infection</strong> List of the top 1 Famous music stars who died in Lung Infection</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
