						Prokofiev was born in Ukraine in 1891 and began playing the piano at a very young age. He attended the St. Petersburg Conservatory where he studied composition and piano. He gained fame in the early 1900s for his avant-garde style, but it wasn't until the 1920s that his music gained widespread popularity. Prokofiev composed numerous works, including operas, ballets, symphonies, and film scores, many of which remain popular today. He moved to the United States in 1918, but returned to the Soviet Union in the 1930s. His later works were heavily influenced by the Soviet government's desire for patriotic music. Despite this, Prokofiev is still regarded as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He died on March 5, 1953, the same day as Joseph Stalin, and his death was somewhat overshadowed by the news of Stalin's passing.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=27681" title="Wikipedia article about Sergei Prokofiev">Sergei Prokofiev on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/british-musicians-died-at-age-70.html' title='British musicians died at age 70'><strong>British musicians died at age 70</strong> List of the top 28 British music stars who died when they were 70</a></li><li><a href='/italian-actresses-died-at-age-59.html' title='Italian actresses died at age 59'><strong>Italian actresses died at age 59</strong> List of the top 4 Italian actresses who died when they were 59</a></li><li><a href='/dutch-musicians-born-in-1948.html' title='Dutch musicians born in 1948'><strong>Dutch musicians born in 1948</strong> List of the top 14 Dutch  music stars who died in who were born in 1948</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/dutch-musicians-born-in-1976.html' title='Dutch musicians born in 1976'><strong>Dutch musicians born in 1976</strong> List of the top 11 Dutch  music stars who died in who were born in 1976</a></li><li><a href='/greek-actors-died-in-1985.html' title='Greek actors died in 1985'><strong>Greek actors died in 1985</strong> List of the top 3 Greek actors who died in 1985</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-staphylococcus-aureus.html' title='Famous musicians died in Staphylococcus aureus'><strong>Famous musicians died in Staphylococcus aureus</strong> List of the top 1 Famous music stars who died in Staphylococcus aureus</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
