					</p><p>Birkeland was particularly known for his work in the field of space physics and his pioneering research into the aurora borealis or northern lights. He was the first to propose that the aurora was caused by charged particles from the sun interacting with the Earth's magnetic field. Birkeland's theories were later confirmed by satellite observations and continue to be widely accepted by the scientific community today. In addition to his work on the aurora, Birkeland also made significant contributions to the field of electromagnetic fields and plasma physics. Despite his many achievements, Birkeland's mental health is known to have deteriorated towards the end of his life and he struggled with financial difficulties.

					</p><p>Snowshoe Thompson, originally named Jon Torsteinsson Rue, was a Norwegian-American who gained fame for his unique contribution to the western United States. He immigrated to the United States with his family in 1837 and settled in rural Illinois. As a young man, he developed expertise in skiing, which he had learned from his father in Norway. In 1851, he moved to California during the Gold Rush and made his living by delivering mail and supplies between the remote mining camps in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. He accomplished this difficult feat by creating his own unique style of snowshoeing that allowed him to travel at incredible speed, even in the harsh winter conditions. Thompson became a local legend in California and Nevada, and his name continues to be associated with skiing and snowshoeing in the United States. Despite his fame, he lived a simple life and passed away from pneumonia at the age of 49.</p><p></p><p>
