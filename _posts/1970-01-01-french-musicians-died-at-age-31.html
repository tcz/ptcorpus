(August 6, 1715		Aix-en-Provence-May 28, 1747			Paris)


was
a French
personality.


					</p><p>Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues was a French essayist, moralist, and aphorist. Born in Aix-en-Provence to a noble family, Vauvenargues began his military career at a young age, but was forced to leave due to an injury. He turned to writing and became known for his insightful observations on human nature and his philosophical views.</p><p>Vauvenargues is perhaps best known for his work "Reflections and Maxims," a collection of philosophical aphorisms that touch on topics such as friendship, morality, and the human condition. This work was highly admired by some of the great thinkers of his time, including Voltaire and Montesquieu.</p><p>Despite his short life, Vauvenargues made a significant impact on French literature and philosophy. His writing style, which was both concise and profound, influenced many later writers and thinkers. Vauvenargues' ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars and philosophers today.</p><p>After leaving the military, Vauvenargues quickly gained a reputation as a man of letters and associated with some of the leading writers of his time, including Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He also formed a close friendship with the philosopher and mathematician, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, who later edited and published Vauvenargues' works after his death. In addition to his philosophical writings, Vauvenargues also wrote a play called "The Marquis of Pontcalé," which was performed at the Comédie-Française in 1745. Unfortunately, Vauvenargues' health was never robust, and he died at the young age of 31 from tuberculosis. Despite his relatively short career as a writer, Vauvenargues remains a significant figure in French literary and philosophical history.</p><p></p><p>

(December 2, 1859		Paris-March 29, 1891			Paris)

	
		a.k.a. Georges Seurat or Georges-Pierre Seurat

	
was
a French
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering work in the field of Neo-Impressionism, which sought to guide art towards a more scientific, objective approach. Seurat is renowned for his meticulous technique of pointillism, in which he created images consisting of tiny, individual dots of color that combine to form coherent visual works. Seurat's most famous painting, "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte," is a testament to his mastery of pointillism and his ability to capture the essence of modern life. In addition to painting, Seurat was also a talented draftsman and printmaker, and he created a number of works in these mediums during his short career. Despite his early death at the age of 31, Seurat left a lasting legacy on the world of art, inspiring subsequent generations of artists and influencing the development of modern art in the 20th century.</p><p>Born into a well-to-do family, Seurat displayed a love for art from a young age. He attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he studied under renowned painter Henri Lehmann. However, Seurat was dissatisfied with the traditional techniques of his instructors and began developing his own style, incorporating elements of Impressionism and Pointillism.</p><p>In 1884, Seurat founded the Société des Artistes Indépendants, a group dedicated to exhibiting the work of emerging artists who were rejected by the official Paris Salon. It was through this organization that Seurat's work gained critical attention, culminating in a solo exhibition in 1888.</p><p>Seurat's work was revolutionary for his time, as he sought to break from tradition and create a new visual language. He applied scientific principles to his art, studying color theory and the psychological effects of color on the human eye. His paintings often depicted everyday life in Paris, with a focus on the working-class and leisure activities. </p><p>Tragically, Seurat died at the young age of 31 from a rare form of meningitis. However, his influence lived on through subsequent generations of artists who were inspired by his techniques and his contributions to the development of modern art.</p><p></p><p>
