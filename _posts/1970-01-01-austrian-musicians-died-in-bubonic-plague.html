						Johann Heinrich Schmelzer was born in Scheibbs, Lower Austria in 1620. He served as a violinist in the chapel of the Bishop of Olomouc before becoming the court violinist of Emperor Leopold I in Vienna. Schmelzer was also a prolific and influential composer during his time, and his music was highly regarded by his contemporaries. He is considered one of the most important exponents of the Viennese violin school, and his works are noted for their innovative use of harmony and counterpoint. In addition to his music, Schmelzer was also known for his extravagant lifestyle and love of gambling, which led to financial difficulties later in life. Despite this, his contributions to music have secured his place in history as one of the foremost composers of the Baroque era.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=3675474" title="Wikipedia article about Johann Heinrich Schmelzer">Johann Heinrich Schmelzer on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/indian-musicians-born-in-1985.html' title='Indian musicians born in 1985'><strong>Indian musicians born in 1985</strong> List of the top 13 Indian  music stars who died in who were born in 1985</a></li><li><a href='/hongkongese-actors-died-in-1997.html' title='Hongkongese actors died in 1997'><strong>Hongkongese actors died in 1997</strong> List of the top 1 Hongkongese actors who died in 1997</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-injury.html' title='Famous musicians died in Injury'><strong>Famous musicians died in Injury</strong> List of the top 2 Famous music stars who died in Injury</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/mexican-actors-died-in-1983.html' title='Mexican actors died in 1983'><strong>Mexican actors died in 1983</strong> List of the top 2 Mexican actors who died in 1983</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-actresses-died-at-age-76.html' title='Japanese actresses died at age 76'><strong>Japanese actresses died at age 76</strong> List of the top 2 Japanese actresses who died when they were 76</a></li><li><a href='/japanese-musicians-died-at-age-32.html' title='Japanese musicians died at age 32'><strong>Japanese musicians died at age 32</strong> List of the top 4 Japanese music stars who died when they were 32</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
