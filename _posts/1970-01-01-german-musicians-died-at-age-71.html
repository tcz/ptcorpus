(June 22, 1863		Berlin-January 1, 1935			Potsdam)


was
a German
politician and diplomat.


					</p><p>He served as the Foreign Secretary of the German Empire from 1913 to 1916, during the critical period leading up to the First World War. Jagow was a career diplomat who was respected for his intelligence and competence. However, he is often criticized for his role in the diplomatic crisis that eventually led to the outbreak of war in 1914. Jagow was a strong advocate of Germany's alliance with Austria-Hungary and his diplomatic efforts were focused on maintaining this alliance. Despite his efforts, he was unable to prevent the escalation of tensions between Europe's major powers and the outbreak of war. After the war, Jagow was briefly imprisoned by the Allies for his role in the conflict but was eventually released.</p><p>Jagow began his career in the German Foreign Service in 1895 and quickly rose through the ranks due to his talent and hard work. Prior to becoming the Foreign Secretary, he served as Germany's ambassador to Rome, where his diplomatic skills helped to strengthen the relationship between Germany and Italy. </p><p>During his time as Foreign Secretary, Jagow faced many challenges, including the Balkan Wars and the growing conflict between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. He was part of the team that drafted the infamous "blank check" that Germany gave to Austria-Hungary, promising unconditional support in its conflict with Serbia. Jagow believed that a quick victory for Austria-Hungary would be in Germany's best interest, but he failed to anticipate Russia's involvement in the conflict. </p><p>After World War I, Jagow withdrew from politics and lived a quiet life in Potsdam until his death in 1935. Despite his controversial role in the events leading up to the war, he remained a respected figure in German diplomatic circles and was even praised by some for his efforts to prevent a larger conflict from breaking out.</p><p></p><p>

was
a German
physicist.


					</p><p>He is widely recognized for his work in the field of electrical engineering, particularly for his contributions in the development of radio communication. After finishing his studies at the University of Berlin, Wien worked as an assistant to Hermann von Helmholtz at the same university. He then went on to work at several institutions, including the Universities of Giessen and Würzburg.</p><p>Wien is known for his work on Wien's Law, which describes the relationship between the temperature of blackbody radiation and its wavelength. He conducted experiments that demonstrated that the energy of a beam of radiation does not depend on the direction of polarization but only on its amplitude. Along with his research on heat radiation, Wien contributed to the understanding of the quantum nature of light and the photoelectric effect.</p><p>In 1912 Wien became a professor at the University of Jena, where he remained until the end of his career. In recognition of his contributions to science, he received many honors and awards including the Max Planck Medal in 1929.</p><p>Throughout his career, Wien published over 150 scientific papers and even wrote a textbook on theoretical physics. He was also a member of many scientific societies and served as the president of the German Physical Society. Unfortunately, during his later years, Wien suffered from Parkinson's disease, which greatly affected his ability to work. He passed away in 1938 at the age of 71. Despite this, his legacy in the fields of electrical engineering and physics still lives on, and his contributions have continued to inspire generations of scientists.</p><p></p><p>

He studied at the University of Berlin and went on to become a professor of philosophy at the University of Königsberg. He was also a member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin and was highly regarded for his contributions to the field of aesthetics.</p><p>Hotho published several notable works on aesthetics during his career, including his seminal work "Die Ästhetik oder Wissenschaft des Schönen" (Aesthetics or the Science of Beauty) in 1851. In this book, he explored the nature of beauty, examining the various ways it is perceived and experienced. He argued that beauty is not a universal concept, but rather is subject to cultural and social influences.</p><p>In addition to his work in aesthetics, Hotho was also an important figure in the art world. He was a member of the Berlin art club, which brought together artists and intellectuals to discuss new trends in art. Hotho was a champion of the Romantic movement in art and played an important role in promoting the work of German artists like Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge.</p><p>Overall, Hotho was a major intellectual figure in 19th-century Germany, known for his contributions to philosophy, aesthetics, and art history. His work helped shape the way we think about beauty, art, and culture to this day.</p><p>Later in his career, Hotho became involved in politics and was elected to the Prussian Chamber of Deputies in 1849. He was a proponent of constitutional reform and worked to advance the rights of citizens. However, his political career was short-lived as he was forced to resign in 1852 due to his outspoken opposition to the conservative policies of the Prussian king.Hotho's influence extended beyond his own work to his students, many of whom went on to become prominent philosophers and art historians in their own right. Among his most famous pupils were Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Ernst Cassirer. Nietzsche, in particular, was strongly influenced by Hotho's ideas on aesthetics, and his work on the topic is often seen as a response to Hotho's writings.Despite this influence, Hotho's work was largely forgotten after his death, and it was not until the 20th century that his contributions to philosophy and aesthetics were rediscovered.

In 1921, he suppressed the Bavarian Soviet Republic, a short-lived socialist state that had emerged after the end of World War I. Kahr was also instrumental in ending hyperinflation in Bavaria and promoting economic growth in the region. However, his more liberal policies made him unpopular with some conservative forces in Bavaria.</p><p>In 1923, Kahr became one of the key figures in the Beer Hall Putsch, a failed coup attempt by Adolf Hitler and his supporters. Kahr was initially sympathetic to the Nazi cause but recoiled in horror after Hitler and his followers stormed into a beer hall where he and other political leaders were holding a meeting. Kahr was captured by the Nazis during the attempted coup and held as a prisoner for several days before being released.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Beer Hall Putsch, Kahr became a more vocal opponent of Nazi ideology. He warned against the dangers of anti-Semitism and ultranationalism and urged Germans to remain loyal to the democratic ideals of the Weimar Republic. Despite his opposition to the Nazis, Kahr was arrested and imprisoned after Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933. He was ultimately killed during the Night of the Long Knives, a purge of Nazi opponents carried out by the SS in June 1934.</p><p></p><p>
