(December 18, 1913		Vilnius-January 23, 2006			New York City)


was
an American
clarinetist.


						</p><p>He is widely recognized as one of the most accomplished and influential clarinetists of the 20th century. Weber began playing the clarinet at a young age and quickly gained a reputation as a virtuoso performer. He first gained national attention in the 1940s as a member of Benny Goodman's band, with which he played for several years. In addition to his work with Goodman, Weber was a prolific recording artist, making numerous albums and appearing on countless television and radio programs.</p><p>Throughout his career, Weber was also a sought-after teacher, and many of his students went on to become successful musicians in their own right. He held teaching positions at several major universities, including The Juilliard School and the Manhattan School of Music. Weber's contributions to the world of music were widely acknowledged throughout his lifetime, and he received numerous awards and honors, including the National Medal of Arts in 1997. He passed away in 2006 at the age of 92.</p><p>In addition to his work as a performer and teacher, David Weber was also a prolific arranger and composer. He wrote over 100 works for the clarinet, including concertos, sonatas, and chamber music. His compositions have been performed by many of the world's leading clarinetists and have been featured on numerous recordings. </p><p>Despite his fame and success, Weber remained modest and humble throughout his life. He was known for his kindness, generosity, and dedication to his craft. In recognition of his contributions to music, the International Clarinet Association established the David Weber Clarinet Prize in 1974, which is awarded annually to a promising young clarinetist. </p><p>Weber's legacy continues to inspire and influence musicians around the world. His recordings and compositions remain popular with clarinetists and music lovers alike, and his impact on the clarinet as an instrument and on the world of music as a whole cannot be overstated.</p><p>Weber's musical talent and dedication were evident from a young age. Born in Vilnius, Lithuania, to a family of musicians, he moved to the United States as a child and began studying the clarinet under the tutelage of his father. By the time he was a teenager, Weber was already an accomplished performer, and he soon began playing professionally in dance bands and on radio programs.</p><p>In the early years of his career, Weber played with a number of top bandleaders, including Artie Shaw and Tommy Dorsey. However, it was his work with Benny Goodman that truly propelled him to fame. Goodman, a legendary clarinetist in his own right, recognized Weber's talent and hired him as a member of his band in the early 1940s. Weber quickly became one of Goodman's key performers, and he appeared on many of the band's most famous recordings, including "Sing, Sing, Sing" and "Moonglow."</p><p>While Weber is perhaps best known for his work as a performer, his contributions to music as a composer and arranger should not be overlooked. He wrote numerous works for the clarinet, many of which have become staples of the clarinet repertoire. He also arranged music for both big band and symphony orchestra, including several arrangements of classical works for clarinet and orchestra.</p><p>Despite his success, Weber remained down to earth and dedicated to his craft. He was known for his tireless practice habits and his willingness to help others, both as a performer and as a teacher. He was widely admired not only for his musical talent but also for his kindness, humility, and generosity of spirit.</p><p>Today, David Weber is remembered as one of the true giants of the clarinet world. His recordings and compositions continue to inspire and challenge clarinetists of all levels, and his impact on the instrument and on the world of music as a whole remains as strong as ever.</p><p></p><p>

							</p><p>He served as the 37th President of the United States, from 1969 until 1974. Nixon is known for his involvement in the Watergate scandal, which led to his resignation from the presidency in 1974. Despite this controversy, Nixon had many accomplishments during his time in office, such as establishing diplomatic relations with China and ending the Vietnam War. Before his presidency, Nixon served as Vice President under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. As a young man, he also served in the United States Navy during World War II. After leaving office, Nixon wrote several books and remained active in politics until his death in 1994.</p><p>Nixon had a challenging childhood, marked by his family's poverty and the early deaths of two of his brothers. However, he was a brilliant student and earned a scholarship to attend Whittier College. He then went on to Duke University Law School, where he graduated third in his class. Nixon practiced law for several years before being elected to Congress in 1946. </p><p>Nixon gained national attention as a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he pursued allegations of communist infiltration in the government and entertainment industry. He rose quickly through the political ranks, serving in the Senate and then as Vice President before being elected to the presidency in 1968. </p><p>During his presidency, Nixon worked to expand social programs and signed several landmark environmental laws. He also oversaw the Apollo 11 moon landing and implemented a policy of detente with the Soviet Union. However, his reputation was forever tarnished by the Watergate scandal, in which he and his administration were found to have engaged in illegal activities, including wiretapping and the burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters. </p><p>After resigning from the presidency, Nixon largely retreated from public life. He wrote several critically-acclaimed books, including his memoirs and a study of foreign policy, and traveled extensively around the world. Nixon also continued to be involved in American politics through his writing and speeches, and remained a controversial figure until his death in 1994.</p><p>Additionally, Nixon was a skilled debater and campaigned tirelessly for his political party. He was known for his aggressive, no-nonsense style and his ability to connect with everyday Americans. He was reelected in a landslide victory in 1972, winning 49 out of 50 states. However, the Watergate scandal soon overshadowed his accomplishments and led to his resignation, making him the only U.S. president to have ever resigned from office. Nixon's legacy remains mixed, with some praising his foreign policy achievements and others condemning his abuses of power. Despite this, he remains a significant figure in American political history and is regularly studied by scholars and political analysts.</p><p></p><p>
