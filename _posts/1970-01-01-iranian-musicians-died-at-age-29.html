an Iranian
politician.


					</p><p>He was a leading member of the religious opposition to the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran and was one of the key figures in the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran after the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Shariatmadari was known for his advocacy of a democratic and egalitarian Islamic government and for his opposition to theocracy.</p><p>He was imprisoned by the Pahlavi regime for his political activities and was released after the revolution. However, he later fell out of favor with the new regime and was placed under house arrest by Ayatollah Khomeini. Despite this, he remained an influential figure in the opposition movement until his death in 1986. His writings and teachings continue to inspire reformist and liberal religious thinkers in Iran and around the world.</p><p>Shariatmadari was born in Tabriz and studied Islamic theology and philosophy in Qom. He later taught these subjects in various seminaries throughout Iran. He was highly respected within the Shiite Muslim community for his intellectual and spiritual leadership. </p><p>During the Pahlavi era, Shariatmadari was a vocal critic of the government's secular policies and its close alliance with the United States. He believed that the Iranian people should have greater control over their government and that Islam should be the guiding force in society. He also opposed the shah's suppression of political dissent and the resulting human rights abuses.</p><p>After the Islamic Revolution, Shariatmadari was considered by many to be a potential leader of the new government. However, his views on democracy and human rights were seen as too progressive by the dominant conservative faction led by Ayatollah Khomeini. Shariatmadari was placed under house arrest and forbidden from any political activity. Despite this, he continued to communicate with his followers and offer his critiques of the government's policies.</p><p>Shariatmadari's legacy has been the subject of debate within Iran. Some conservatives view him as a dangerous liberal who sought to weaken the Islamic Republic, while reformists see him as a visionary who advocated for a more democratic and tolerant Islamic government. His writings, including his book "Islam and Democracy," remain influential among Muslim reformists and intellectuals.</p><p></p><p>
