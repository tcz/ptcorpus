(December 15, 1860		Tórshavn-September 24, 1904			Copenhagen)

	
		also known as Dr. Niels Ryberg Finsen

	
was
a Danish
physician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering work in the field of phototherapy, specifically the use of concentrated light radiation in the treatment of diseases such as lupus vulgaris. Finsen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1903 for his contributions to the understanding and treatment of diseases of the skin. Additionally, he was a prolific author, publishing numerous papers and articles on topics ranging from medical research to socially-minded criticism of the Danish government. Despite his relatively short life, Finsen left a lasting impact on the field of medicine and his work is still studied and referenced by medical professionals around the world.</p><p>Finsen began his medical education at the University of Copenhagen and later continued his studies in Germany and Austria. After completing his education, he practiced medicine in his hometown of Tórshavn before returning to Copenhagen to work at the Municipal Hospital. It was during this time that he began his experiments with light therapy, inspired by the work of German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter.</p><p>Finsen's development of the Finsen lamp, a device that concentrated light radiation to treat skin diseases, revolutionized the field of phototherapy. His research paved the way for the use of ultraviolet light in the treatment of conditions such as psoriasis and skin cancer.</p><p>In addition to his scientific contributions, Finsen was also involved in social and political issues in Denmark. He was a vocal opponent of the country's oppressive policies towards the Faroe Islands and Greenland, and advocated for greater autonomy for these territories.</p><p>Finsen's health began to decline in the early 1900s, and he eventually succumbed to pernicious anemia in 1904 at the age of 43. His legacy, however, lives on through his contributions to medicine and his impact on issues of social justice.</p><p></p><p>
