(December 15, 1860		Tórshavn-September 24, 1904			Copenhagen)

	
		also known as Dr. Niels Ryberg Finsen

	
was
a Danish
physician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his pioneering work in the field of phototherapy, specifically the use of concentrated light radiation in the treatment of diseases such as lupus vulgaris. Finsen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1903 for his contributions to the understanding and treatment of diseases of the skin. Additionally, he was a prolific author, publishing numerous papers and articles on topics ranging from medical research to socially-minded criticism of the Danish government. Despite his relatively short life, Finsen left a lasting impact on the field of medicine and his work is still studied and referenced by medical professionals around the world.</p><p>Finsen began his medical education at the University of Copenhagen and later continued his studies in Germany and Austria. After completing his education, he practiced medicine in his hometown of Tórshavn before returning to Copenhagen to work at the Municipal Hospital. It was during this time that he began his experiments with light therapy, inspired by the work of German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter.</p><p>Finsen's development of the Finsen lamp, a device that concentrated light radiation to treat skin diseases, revolutionized the field of phototherapy. His research paved the way for the use of ultraviolet light in the treatment of conditions such as psoriasis and skin cancer.</p><p>In addition to his scientific contributions, Finsen was also involved in social and political issues in Denmark. He was a vocal opponent of the country's oppressive policies towards the Faroe Islands and Greenland, and advocated for greater autonomy for these territories.</p><p>Finsen's health began to decline in the early 1900s, and he eventually succumbed to pernicious anemia in 1904 at the age of 43. His legacy, however, lives on through his contributions to medicine and his impact on issues of social justice.</p><p>Finsen was born in Tórshavn, in the Faroe Islands which were at that time under Danish-Norwegian rule. His father was a merchant and his mother's family were prominent members of Faroese society. Finsen was the second oldest of four siblings.</p><p>At the age of 17, Finsen moved to Copenhagen to study medicine at the University of Copenhagen. He graduated with a medical degree in 1890 and began practicing medicine in Tórshavn. He later returned to Copenhagen to work at the Municipal Hospital, where he began his research into phototherapy.</p><p>Finsen's work was not immediately accepted by the medical community, but he persisted and eventually gained widespread recognition for his contributions to the field. In addition to his Nobel Prize, he also received the Elliot Cresson Medal from the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in 1903.</p><p>Finsen's legacy has been honored in a number of ways. In 1905, the Finsen Laboratory was founded in Copenhagen, dedicated to the study of skin diseases and phototherapy. The laboratory continues to operate today as part of the University of Copenhagen's Department of Dermatology and Allergy.</p><p>In Tórshavn, a statue of Finsen was erected in 1913 in recognition of his contributions to medicine and science. The Niels Finsen House, a cultural center and museum, was also established in the city in 1996.</p><p>Overall, Finsen's groundbreaking research into phototherapy and his advocacy for social justice have left an indelible mark on Danish and global history.</p><p>Finsen's contributions to phototherapy were not limited to the treatment of skin diseases. He also studied the effects of light on tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. His research on tuberculosis led to the development of the Finsen-Ray therapy, which used ultraviolet light to treat the disease in the lungs. Finsen's work on tuberculosis was especially significant at the time, as the disease was a major public health concern in many parts of the world.</p><p>Finsen's interest in social justice extended beyond his advocacy for the autonomy of the Faroe Islands and Greenland. He was also a supporter of women's rights and was involved in the founding of Denmark's first women's rights organization. Finsen's wife, Ingeborg, was also an advocate for women's rights and helped found the organization alongside her husband.</p><p>Despite his many contributions to the field of medicine, Finsen's life was not without challenges. He suffered from poor health throughout his life, and his political views led to conflict with some members of the Danish establishment. Nevertheless, his dedication to medical research and his commitment to social justice have ensured that his legacy lives on to this day.</p><p>In 1901, Finsen was diagnosed with pernicious anemia, a condition that was not well understood at the time. He traveled to the United States in search of a cure, but his health continued to deteriorate. Despite his illness, Finsen continued to work and advocate for his causes until his death in 1904.</p><p>Finsen was also a lover of literature and the arts, and he frequently attended concerts and theater performances. He was a close friend of Danish writer and Nobel laureate Henrik Pontoppidan, and the two men corresponded regularly.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and social contributions, Finsen was also a family man. He married Ingeborg Balslev, a fellow medical student, in 1892, and the couple had three children.</p><p>Today, Finsen is remembered as a pioneer in the field of phototherapy and a champion of social justice. His legacy continues to inspire medical professionals and activists around the world.</p><p></p><p>
