									</h1><p>Here are 21 famous musicians from Austria died at 73:</p><h2>Erwin Schrödinger</h2><p><strong>Erwin Schrödinger</strong>
(August 12, 1887		Vienna-January 4, 1961			Vienna)

	
		otherwise known as Erwin Schrodinger, Erwin Schrödinger or Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger

	
was
an Austrian
physicist.


					</p><p>Schrödinger is famous for his groundbreaking work in quantum mechanics, notably his development of the Schrödinger equation. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 for his contributions to the development of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger also made important contributions to the field of thermodynamics and to the understanding of the nature of light. In addition to his scientific work, he was also a philosopher and wrote several books on the intersection of science, philosophy, and spirituality. During his lifetime, Schrödinger held numerous academic positions in Europe, including professorships in Zurich, Vienna, and Berlin.</p><p>Schrödinger's personal life was marked by several marriages - he was married four times - and numerous affairs, including one with his third wife's adult daughter. He also struggled with depression and his health throughout his life. In 1935, he moved to Ireland and took up a position at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, where he spent the majority of the rest of his life. Despite his contributions to quantum mechanics, Schrödinger was critical of some of its interpretations, famously questioning the implications of his own thought experiment, Schrödinger's cat. Today, Schrödinger's work is still widely studied and has had a profound impact on our understanding of the nature of reality.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by tuberculosis.

In 1939, Aufschnaiter and Heinrich Harrer were part of a four-man team that successfully completed the first ascent of the infamous North Face of the Eiger in the Swiss Alps. Later that year, he and Harrer set out on a trip to Tibet, but their plans were derailed by the outbreak of World War II. They were subsequently interned in a British POW camp in India.</p><p>In 1944, Aufschnaiter and Harrer escaped from the camp and embarked on an incredible journey across the Himalayas to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. They lived in Tibet for several years, where Aufschnaiter became a close confidant of the Dalai Lama and served as an agricultural advisor to the Tibetan government.</p><p>After leaving Tibet in 1951, Aufschnaiter returned to Austria and became a successful painter, focusing on landscape and mountain scenes. He remained an active mountain climber into his seventies and died in 1973 at the age of 73.</p><p>Aufschnaiter's time in Tibet was not without controversy. He was a member of the Nazi party and had a strained relationship with Harrer, who was also a Nazi. Aufschnaiter himself admitted that he joined the party for career opportunities, not because of any ideological beliefs. Regardless, some have criticized Aufschnaiter's involvement with the party and the fact that he remained in Tibet during China's invasion and occupation of the country in the 1950s.</p><p>Despite this, Aufschnaiter's accomplishments as a mountaineer and adventurer are still remembered today. He wrote an account of his travels with Harrer in the book "Seven Years in Tibet", which was later made into a movie starring Brad Pitt. The book has become a classic of mountaineering and travel literature, and Aufschnaiter is remembered as one of the most important explorers of the 20th century.</p><p></p><p>

Feit's work also had applications in theoretical physics, where it helped provide a framework for understanding the behavior of subatomic particles.</p><p>Throughout his career, Feit was also known as an inspiring teacher and mentor. He was deeply committed to his students and worked tirelessly to help them succeed. Many of his students went on to become leading mathematicians in their own right.</p><p>In addition to his mathematical work, Feit was an active participant in social justice causes. He was involved in civil rights activism in the United States during the 1960s and remained committed to improving the lives of others throughout his life.

(January 30, 1872		Hluboká nad Vltavou-June 1, 1945			New York City)

	
		otherwise known as Dr. Eduard Bloch

	
was
an Austrian
physician.


					</p><p>He was known for his close relationship with the family of Adolf Hitler when they lived in Linz before the rise of National Socialism. As a young boy, Hitler was a patient of Bloch's, and later in life, he became a friend of the Bloch family. Despite the Nazi's anti-Semitic policies, which led to the persecution of many Jewish people, including Bloch, Hitler regarded him as one of his closest childhood friends and ensured that he was protected from harm. Bloch eventually fled Austria for Switzerland and eventually emigrated to the United States, where he lived until his death in 1945.</p><p>Bloch was born into a Jewish family in Hluboká nad Vltavou, Austria-Hungary. He graduated from medical school in Vienna in 1897 and then moved to Linz to start his medical practice. It was in Linz that he first met the young Adolf Hitler, who suffered from persistent respiratory problems. Bloch treated Hitler and became a friend of the family. </p><p>Bloch's relationship with Hitler was complicated. On one hand, Hitler held him in high regard and ensured that he was protected from harm during the rise of the Nazis. On the other hand, Bloch was ultimately forced to flee Austria due to the anti-Semitic policies that were put in place. Hitler allegedly instructed his SS guards to protect Bloch's family during their escape from Austria. </p><p>After immigrating to the United States, Bloch settled in New York City, where he worked at a hospital for several years. He died on June 1, 1945, in New York City, at the age of 73. Despite his complicated ties to Hitler, Bloch himself was a victim of Nazi persecution and discrimination, having been forced to flee his home country due to his Jewish heritage.</p><p></p><p>

was
an Austrian
personality.


					</p><p>He served as a field marshal in the Austrian army during the French Revolutionary Wars and played a significant role in the Siege of Mantua, one of the longest and most prolonged campaigns of these wars. Wurmser was born in Strasbourg, which was then part of the Holy Roman Empire. He joined the Austrian army at a young age and quickly rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a field marshal. In 1796, he was dispatched to the Italian front, where he played a key role in several battles against the French army. Despite being forced to retreat after the Battle of Castiglione, Wurmser soon returned to the fray, leading the successful defense of Mantua against repeated French attacks. However, he was ultimately forced to surrender the city to Napoleon Bonaparte in early 1797. Wurmser retired from the army soon after and died several months later in Vienna.</p><p>During his long military career, Wurmser established himself as a tactical mastermind, a courageous soldier, and a respected leader. He fought in multiple battles throughout Europe, including the Seven Years' War and the War of the Bavarian Succession, before being deployed to Italy during the French Revolutionary Wars. Despite his advanced age and health issues, Wurmser led his troops with great determination and skill, earning praise from both his superiors and his subordinates. His defense of Mantua, in particular, was considered a remarkable feat of military strategy and endurance.
