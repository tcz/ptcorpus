(November 6, 1946		Essen-April 28, 1976			Lippstadt)

	
		also known as Jurgen Bartsch

	
was
a West German
personality.


					</p><p>Jürgen Bartsch was a convicted serial killer who committed four murders between 1962 and 1966. He became known as the "Beast of Langdorn" due to the brutal nature of his crimes. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1966 and committed suicide by hanging himself in prison on April 28, 1976. His case is considered one of the most notorious in German criminal history.</p><p>Born in Essen, Germany, Jürgen Bartsch was the son of a coal miner. He had a difficult childhood and was often bullied at school. He didn't receive much attention from his parents, which led to him becoming a solitary child who enjoyed torturing animals.</p><p>At the age of 16, he committed his first murder when he strangled a boy who he believed had mocked him. Over the next four years, he went on to murder three more victims, all boys younger than him. He would lure them into the woods, sexually assault them, and then kill them by strangulation, stabbing, or bludgeoning.</p><p>Bartsch was eventually caught when a witness identified him leaving the scene of his last murder. He confessed to all four killings and was sentenced to life in prison. During his incarceration, he underwent psychiatric treatment and was diagnosed with several mental disorders, including sadism.</p><p>Despite being a convicted killer, Bartsch became somewhat of a media sensation in Germany due to his good looks and charming personality. There were even women who sent him love letters while he was in prison. However, his mental state deteriorated over time, and he eventually took his own life by hanging himself in his cell in 1976.</p><p>Bartsch's case brought attention to the issue of juvenile delinquency and the importance of psychiatric treatment within the German criminal justice system. His crimes also had a lasting impact on the families of his victims, who had to come to terms with the brutal nature of their children's deaths. In the years since his death, Bartsch's legacy has continued to fascinate and unsettle those who study criminal psychology and forensic science. Despite the passage of time, he remains one of the most infamous murderers in German history.</p><p></p><p>
