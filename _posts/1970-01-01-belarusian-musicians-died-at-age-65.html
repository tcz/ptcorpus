However, the film was eventually released to critical acclaim.</p><p>Today, Gintsburg's contributions to Soviet cinema continue to be celebrated in Russia. His films are still recognized as classics, and he is remembered as a talented director and cinematographer who helped shape the course of Soviet cinema.</p><p></p><p>
