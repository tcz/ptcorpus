He wrote several novels, short stories, and essays on a range of subjects. However, Neutzsky-Wulff is best known for his work as a translator, particularly translations of classical Greek and Latin texts such as the works of Aristotle and Plato.</p><p>Alongside his literary pursuits, Neutzsky-Wulff was a keen art collector and in 1942 he donated his extensive collection of paintings, sculptures and other artworks to the city of Aalborg. Today, this collection forms the nucleus of the town's art museum.</p><p>Neutzsky-Wullf was also politically active and was a member of the Danish Social Democratic Party. In 1951, he was awarded the prestigious Danish literature prize, the Holberg Medal.</p><p>Throughout his career, Aage Neutzsky-Wulff was known for his meticulous attention to detail in both his writing and translations. He was also known for his profound knowledge of the classical world, which he brought to life through his translations of ancient texts. In addition to his literary contributions, he also worked as a cultural commentator, contributing articles on art, literature, and politics to various Danish newspapers and magazines.</p><p>During the Second World War, Neutzsky-Wulff was actively involved in the Danish resistance movement against the Nazi occupation. He used his skills as a writer and translator to produce and distribute anti-Nazi propaganda. After the war, he continued to write and publish until his death in 1967.</p><p>Today, Aage Neutzsky-Wulff is remembered as one of Denmark's most important literary figures of the 20th century. His translations and literary works are still widely read and studied, and his legacy as a cultural commentator, art collector, and political activist continues to inspire new generations of writers and thinkers.</p><p>In addition to his extensive literary and cultural contributions, Aage Neutzsky-Wulff was also a polyglot who spoke several languages fluently. He was particularly skilled in ancient Greek and Latin, which he used to produce impeccable translations of classical texts. His translations of Aristotle, Plato, and other classical authors are still regarded as some of the most accurate and nuanced versions available in Danish.With his wife, Neutzsky-Wulff also co-authored a popular cookbook, which is still in print today. The book, titled "Madam Mangor's Kogebog", contains a collection of traditional Danish recipes and was first published in 1934. Beyond his writing, Neutzsky-Wulff was an active member of Danish society, holding a variety of positions in cultural and educational institutions. He was also a devoted family man, known for his love of his wife and son, and his generous spirit towards his extended family and friends.</p><p>Neutzsky-Wulff's political activism continued beyond his involvement in the resistance movement during the Second World War. He was a committed socialist and public intellectual who frequently wrote and spoke out against fascism, colonialism, and totalitarianism. In 1947, he helped found the Danish chapter of the international PEN Club, a writers' association that promotes freedom of expression and defends writers who are persecuted for their work. Neutzsky-Wulff was also a founding member of the Danish Writers' Association and served as its chair from 1944 to 1946.</p><p>Neutzsky-Wulff's literary works cover a wide range of genres and subjects. His first novel, "Vildtresning" (Wilderness Training), was published in 1921 and tells the story of a young man's struggles to survive in the harsh Danish countryside. He went on to write several more novels, including "Journalist" (1925), which satirizes the sensationalist tendencies of the press, and "Min søster Hilmer" (My Sister Hilmer, 1935), a psychological drama about a troubled young woman. His short stories, collected in volumes such as "Natur" (Nature, 1927) and "Psykologi" (Psychology, 1941), often explore themes of loneliness, alienation, and the complexity of human emotions.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Neutzsky-Wulff's reputation suffered in the post-war years due to his association with the far-right politician Poul Henningsen. Neutzsky-Wulff had supported Henningsen's anti-communist campaign in the 1930s and briefly served as a member of his National Socialist Workers' Party during the German occupation. However, he later distanced himself from Henningsen and the party, and his political views remained aligned with the left-wing Social Democrats. In recent years, Neutzsky-Wulff's legacy has been reassessed, and his contributions to Danish literature and culture have been recognized as significant and enduring.</p><p></p><p>
