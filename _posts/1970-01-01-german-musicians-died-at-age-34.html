was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Hilde Coppi was a member of the German resistance during World War II. She and her husband, Hans Coppi, were both involved in the group known as the Red Orchestra, which worked to undermine the Nazi regime by distributing anti-fascist propaganda and gathering intelligence for the Soviet Union. </p><p>Hilde and Hans were both arrested in August 1942 and were sentenced to death by the People's Court in April 1943. Hilde bravely refused to provide any information about her fellow resistance members, even under torture. She was executed alongside her husband on August 5, 1943, at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin.</p><p>Hilde Coppi is remembered as a hero and a symbol of resistance against the Nazi regime. Her courageous actions continue to inspire people around the world who fight for freedom and justice.</p><p>Despite growing up in a middle-class family and receiving a privileged education, Hilde Coppi became disillusioned with the Nazi regime early on and actively sought to resist their oppressive tactics. She joined the Red Orchestra in 1940, which was a widespread resistance network that sought to bring down the Nazi regime from within.</p><p>Hilde and Hans had two children together, a son and a daughter, both of whom were taken away from them when they were arrested by the Gestapo. Despite knowing that their arrest would likely lead to their execution, the Coppi's refused to divulge information about their fellow resistance members, stating that they would rather die than betray their peers.</p><p>Their execution was followed by hundreds of others who were members of the Red Orchestra, yet their bravery and steadfastness in the face of certain death has been an inspiration to many who continue to fight for human rights today. In her honor, the city of Berlin named a street and a school after Hilde Coppi.</p><p>In addition to being a member of the Red Orchestra, Hilde Coppi was also a dedicated communist and feminist. She was passionate about promoting women's rights and encouraging women to take an active role in political resistance. Her courage and commitment to the cause of freedom has been celebrated in books, documentaries, and memorials. In 1950, a memorial sculpture was erected in her honor in Berlin's Wedding neighborhood, where she had lived and worked as a nurse prior to joining the resistance. Today, Hilde Coppi's legacy lives on as a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up against injustice and oppression, even in the face of great personal risk.</p><p></p><p>

He was married to Princess Wilhelmine Ernestine of Denmark-Norway and had two children, a daughter and a son who succeeded him as Elector Palatine. Charles II died at the age of 34 due to complications of a fever.</p><p>Aside from being a patron of the arts and a supporter of advancements in science and technology, Charles II was also known for his political views. He was a strong advocate of the power of the nobility and their right to self-government. These views often led to conflicts with the absolutist policies of the Holy Roman Emperor, which led to frequent disputes between the Elector Palatine and the Emperor’s chief ministers. </p><p>Charles II was also deeply involved in religious affairs, and he worked hard to promote religious tolerance in his lands. This was reflected in his policies, which allowed for a mix of faiths and allowed for Catholics to worship freely despite the predominance of Protestantism in the region.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Charles II’s reign was marked by war and conflict. During his reign, the Palatinate was subject to frequent invasions from French forces, which left the region devastated. Charles II did his best to rebuild and restore his lands, but his efforts were hampered by the ongoing conflicts of the time. </p><p>Today, Charles II is remembered as a progressive and forward-thinking ruler who made significant contributions to the arts, sciences, and culture of his time. His legacy lives on in the form of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences, which he founded over 300 years ago.</p><p>As a lover of the arts, Charles II was known to have commissioned many works of art during his reign. He was a great admirer of the Italian baroque style and the Dutch golden age style, and he worked tirelessly to bring artists and artisans from across Europe to his court in Heidelberg. Charles II's interest in the arts also extended to music, and he was known to have a large collection of musical instruments which he used to entertain his guests.</p><p>Charles II's interest in science and technology led him to establish the first printing press in the Electoral Palatinate, which was located in Heidelberg. This press enabled the dissemination of knowledge and ideas throughout the region and helped to promote literacy and education. Charles II was also responsible for the construction of several scientific instruments, including a telescope and a pendulum clock, which were used by the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences to conduct groundbreaking research.</p><p>Despite his untimely death at the age of 34, Charles II's legacy lived on through his son, who succeeded him as Elector Palatine. Under his son's reign, the Electoral Palatinate experienced a period of stability and continued growth, building upon the foundations laid by Charles II. Today, Charles II is still remembered as a visionary leader who made significant contributions to the arts, sciences, and culture of his time.</p><p></p><p>

(November 18, 1910		Weißwasser-February 23, 1945			Poznań)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a highly-ranked SS officer during World War II and was responsible for numerous war crimes in the occupied territories. Lange was the Commandant of the Riga Ghetto in Latvia, where he oversaw the mass murder of thousands of Jews. He also played a key role in the implementation of the "Final Solution", the Nazi plan for the extermination of European Jews. In 1944, he was sent to Poznań, Poland, where he continued to carry out war crimes until he was killed by Allied forces in 1945. Lange's actions during the war have made him one of the most vilified figures in history.</p><p>Lange was born into a middle-class family in Weißwasser, Germany. He joined the Nazi Party in 1930 and later became a member of the Schutzstaffel (SS). During the war, he was appointed as the head of the Einsatzkommando, a group charged with carrying out mass murder and genocide in the occupied territories. Lange was known for his brutal tactics and his willingness to carry out orders without question.</p><p>At the Riga Ghetto, Lange oversaw the forced labor and deportation of tens of thousands of Jews. He was also responsible for the murders of around 30,000 Jews who were shot and buried in mass graves. In Poznań, Lange was involved in the brutal suppression of the Warsaw Uprising and the killing of Polish civilians.</p><p>Despite his atrocities, Lange continued to receive promotions and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in 1944 for his actions in Latvia. However, as Allied forces closed in on Poznań, Lange tried to flee dressed as a civilian but was captured and executed by the Polish resistance.</p><p>Lange's legacy remains controversial, with some arguing that he was simply following orders and others condemning him as a war criminal. Regardless of one's perspective, his actions during the war have had a profound impact on history and serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of fascism and totalitarianism.</p><p>Lange's early life is not very well-documented, except for the fact that he grew up in Weißwasser, in Germany. He attended high school and then worked briefly as a bank clerk before joining the Nazi Party at the age of 20, in 1930. After joining the SS, he quickly rose through the ranks, thanks in part to his loyalty and dedication to the party.</p><p>During his time as the Commandant of the Riga Ghetto, Lange distinguished himself as one of the most brutal and sadistic Nazi officers. He was known for his cruel treatment of the Jews under his command and his disregard for their basic human rights. The conditions in the ghetto were horrendous, with many Jews dying from disease, starvation, and torture.</p><p>After his transfer to Poznań, Lange continued his reign of terror, overseeing the killing of Polish civilians and the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising. He was despised by both the Poles and the Jews, who saw him as a symbol of the Nazi oppression.</p><p>In the years since his death, Lange's legacy has continued to be debated. Some historians have argued that he was simply a product of his times, a man who was following orders and doing his duty to the best of his abilities. Others, however, have called him a war criminal who deserved to be held accountable for his crimes.</p><p>Regardless of one's opinion of him, there is no denying that Lange was a significant figure in one of the darkest periods of human history. His actions during the war serve as a reminder of the dangers of totalitarianism and the importance of standing up against oppression and injustice.</p><p></p><p>

(October 5, 1841		Offenbach-April 1, 1876			Offenbach)

	
		a.k.a. Philipp Mainlander

	
was
a German
philosopher.


					</p><p>Mainländer is known for his work "Die Philosophie der Erlösung" ("The Philosophy of Redemption"), published in 1876, which sought to reconcile Eastern metaphysics with Western philosophy. In his work, he posited that existence is a state of suffering and that the only way to escape this suffering is through the annihilation of the self. He also believed that the universe is finite and that its existence will eventually result in a collective redemption, referred to as "the great Sabbath" or "the great Sunday."</p><p>Despite the significance of his work, Mainländer's mental health deteriorated as he completed his book. He struggled with depression and felt that he was not receiving the recognition he deserved. On April 1, 1876, he committed suicide by hanging himself in his parents' attic. His work garnered more attention posthumously, with notable admirers including Friedrich Nietzsche and Hermann Hesse.</p><p>Mainländer was born in Offenbach as Philipp Batz to Karl Batz and his wife. His father was a successful businessman and civic leader who encouraged his son's early interest in philosophy. However, Mainländer later grew disillusioned with his bourgeois upbringing and ultimately rejected his family's social status. He suffered from chronic health problems throughout his life, including epilepsy, which made it difficult for him to maintain regular employment.</p><p>After completing his initial education, Mainländer pursued further studies at the University of Heidelberg under the mentorship of the philosopher Kuno Fischer. He also spent time studying in Paris and London before returning to Offenbach to care for his aging parents.</p><p>Despite his talent and ambition, Mainländer struggled to find a publisher for his work. He initially self-published "The Philosophy of Redemption" in a limited edition of 500 copies, with little success. It was only after his death that his work gained wider recognition.</p><p>Mainländer's ideas were considered controversial and unorthodox during his lifetime. He drew on diverse sources, including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christianity, to develop a philosophical system that was both mystical and scientific. He saw himself as a prophet of a new age of spirituality and believed that his work would inspire a revolution in thought and culture.</p><p>Today, Mainländer is considered a significant figure in the history of German philosophy. His work has inspired numerous scholars and artists and continues to influence contemporary debates in metaphysics, theology, and ethics.</p><p>Mainländer's work "The Philosophy of Redemption" has been translated into several languages, including French and Russian, and has gained a following among intellectuals and artists such as Hermann Hesse, who called him a "genius of modern times." His work has been cited as an influence on the development of German modernism and is seen as a precursor to existentialism.</p><p>Despite his early death, Mainländer continues to be studied and discussed by scholars today, with renewed interest in his ideas and their relevance to contemporary philosophical debates. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in his work on topics such as death, the afterlife, and the relationship between Eastern and Western thought.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of suicide.
