(November 29, 0111		Bithynia-October 30, 0130			Mallawi)


was
a Greek
personality.


					</p><p>Antinous was a celebrated lover and favorite of the Roman emperor Hadrian. He was born in the province of Bithynia (in present-day Turkey) and was likely of Greek origin. After meeting Hadrian in 120 AD, Antinous became a favored companion of the Emperor, accompanying him on his travels and reportedly providing him with great comfort and companionship. </p><p>Tragically, Antinous died at a young age while swimming in the Nile during a trip to Egypt with Hadrian. His death was deeply mourned by the Emperor, who reportedly had him deified and founded a city in his honor, called Antinopolis. Antinous has since become a cultural symbol of same-sex love and has been a subject of art and literature for centuries.</p><p>Antinous was not only a favorite of the Emperor, but he was also known for his beauty and charm throughout the Roman world. His image was depicted in statues and sculptures across the empire, and many poems and songs were written about his legendary beauty. In addition to being deified by Hadrian, Antinous was also worshipped as a god by the people of Antinopolis, who built a temple devoted to him. The exact nature of Hadrian's relationship with Antinous has been the subject of much speculation and debate, with some historians suggesting they may have had a romantic relationship. Whatever the nature of their relationship, it is clear that Antinous had a profound impact on Hadrian's life and legacy, and his memory has been celebrated for centuries as a symbol of beauty, love, and devotion.</p><p>Antinous' death is shrouded in mystery and has led to many theories as to the circumstances surrounding his demise. Some speculate that he may have sacrificed himself to save Hadrian from drowning, while others suggest he died as a result of a ritualistic suicide, a practice common in ancient Greece. Despite the uncertainty surrounding his death, the impact of Antinous on Hadrian's life and legacy is undeniable. Hadrian commissioned many statues and monuments in his honor, and his cult continued to thrive in the years following his death. Antinous has continued to be celebrated in art and literature, and his legacy as a symbol of same-sex love and beauty endures to this day.</p><p></p><p>
