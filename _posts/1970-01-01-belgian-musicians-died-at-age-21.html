(October 8, 1953		Brussels-December 29, 1974)


was
a Belgian
personality.


					</p><p>Sophie Podolski was a Belgian writer and artist known for her book of poems and drawings, "Le pays où tout est permis" (The Country Where Everything Is Permitted). The book was published in 1972, when Podolski was only 19 years old, and has become a cult classic in the world of Belgian and French literature. </p><p>In addition to her writing and artwork, Podolski was a member of the counter-culture movement in Brussels during the 1960s and 1970s. She was a regular at the "Insolites" cafe, a gathering place for artists, poets, and musicians, and was friends with many notable figures of the time, including Jacques Brel and Francois Weyergans. </p><p>Tragically, Sophie Podolski took her own life at the age of 21. She remains an emblematic figure for the countercultural movements of the time, and her work continues to be celebrated and studied today.</p><p>Following the publication of "Le pays où tout est permis" in 1972, Podolski was hailed as a rising star of Belgian literature. The book, which features poems full of whimsical and surreal imagery, along with drawings that are equally dreamlike, was seen as a reflection of the countercultural spirit of the times. However, despite the acclaim, Podolski struggled with mental health issues and depression. She took her own life just two years after the book was published, leaving behind a legacy that has continued to inspire generations of artists and writers. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Podolski's life and work, with several new editions of "Le pays où tout est permis" being published and exhibitions of her artwork being held in Brussels and Paris.</p><p>Sophie Podolski was born into a Jewish family in Brussels, Belgium. Due to her family background and personal experiences, her work often reflects themes of social and political revolution, as well as feminism and anti-capitalism. In addition to her writing and artwork, Podolski was also involved in activism, particularly in the feminist and anti-establishment movements. She was known for her free-spirited and rebellious nature, which made her a beloved figure among her peers. Despite her early passing, Sophie Podolski's influence on creative movements of the time, particularly in Belgium, has endured, cementing her place as a key figure in countercultural history.</p><p></p><p>
