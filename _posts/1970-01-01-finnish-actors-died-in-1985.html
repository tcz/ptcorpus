						</p><p>Rinne began his acting career at the Tampereen Teatteri theater in Tampere. Over the course of his career, he appeared in numerous Finnish films, television shows, and theater productions. Some of his most notable roles include "The Train Stops at the Marshalling Yard," "Juha," and "Under the North Star". Rinne was a respected actor in Finland and was awarded the State Prize for Literature and Art in 1955 for his contributions to Finnish culture. In addition to acting, Rinne was also a painter and musician. He passed away in Helsinki at the age of 91.</p><p>Rinne was born as Jalmari Ivar Gröndahl, but he later changed his surname to Rinne. He came from a family of musicians - his father was a violinist and his mother was a singer. Rinne's own musical talents were evident from a young age, and he learned to play the violin, guitar, and piano. In addition to his work as an actor, Rinne was also a prolific painter, and his works were exhibited in galleries across Finland. He was particularly known for his landscapes and still-lifes. Rinne remained active in the performing arts throughout his life, and even performed in his final role as an actor at the age of 89. He was a beloved figure in Finland's cultural scene, and his contributions to the country's artistic heritage continue to be celebrated today.</p><p>Rinne was also a devoted and active member of the Finnish Communist Party, and his political beliefs influenced much of his work as an actor and painter. He was known for his portrayals of working-class characters and his passionate advocacy for social justice. Rinne's commitment to his political ideals came at a cost, however, and he was often persecuted and blacklisted by the Finnish government for his views. Despite this, Rinne remained steadfast in his beliefs and continued to use his art as a means of advocating for a more equitable society. Today, he is remembered not only as a talented actor and painter, but also as a courageous and principled advocate for social change.</p><p>Throughout his career, Rinne was not only recognized for his talent as an actor, but also for his contributions to Finnish culture. He was awarded the Pro Finlandia Medal in 1946, the Order of the Finnish Lion in 1964, and was nominated for the Jussi Award for Best Actor in 1945 and 1955. In addition to his involvement in the arts and politics, Rinne also had a passion for sports. He was an avid hiker and skier, and even competed as a cross-country skier in the 1936 Winter Olympics. Rinne's legacy in Finland remains strong, and his contributions to the country's culture and history continue to be celebrated by fans of his work.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/greek-actresses-died-in-1973.html' title='Greek actresses died in 1973'><strong>Greek actresses died in 1973</strong> List of the top 2 Greek actresses who died in 1973</a></li><li><a href='/algerian-musicians-died-at-age-67.html' title='Algerian musicians died at age 67'><strong>Algerian musicians died at age 67</strong> List of the top 2 Algerian music stars who died when they were 67</a></li><li><a href='/greek-actors-died-in-2014.html' title='Greek actors died in 2014'><strong>Greek actors died in 2014</strong> List of the top 1 Greek actors who died in 2014</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-bronchitis.html' title='Famous actors died in Bronchitis'><strong>Famous actors died in Bronchitis</strong> List of the top 6 Famous actors who died in Bronchitis</a></li><li><a href='/italian-actresses-died-in-1965.html' title='Italian actresses died in 1965'><strong>Italian actresses died in 1965</strong> List of the top 1 Italian actresses who died in 1965</a></li><li><a href='/russian-actors-died-in-1996.html' title='Russian actors died in 1996'><strong>Russian actors died in 1996</strong> List of the top 6 Russian actors who died in 1996</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
