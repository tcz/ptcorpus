(July 26, 1678		Vienna-April 17, 1711			Vienna)


was
a Hungarian
personality.


					
			
		His children
		are
		
		Maria Josepha of Austria, Archduke Leopold Joseph of Austria and Maria Amalia of Austria.

						</p><p>Joseph I was the eldest son of Emperor Leopold I and his third wife, Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg. From a young age, he was heavily influenced by his mother's strong Catholic faith and he was educated accordingly. In 1690, he was elected King of the Romans, a title that guaranteed him the position of Holy Roman Emperor upon his father's death. </p><p>During his reign, Joseph I undertook several military campaigns against the Ottoman Empire, scoring significant victories that expanded the Habsburg territories. He also helped secure the Spanish throne for his younger brother, Charles, by involving Austria in the War of Spanish Succession. </p><p>Despite his military achievements, Joseph I was known for his gentle disposition and his patronage of the arts. He supported the construction of several important buildings in Vienna, including the Belvedere Palace and the Karlskirche. </p><p>Joseph I's marriage to Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg was childless, but he had several children outside marriage, including Maria Josepha, who married King Augustus III of Poland, and Maria Amalia, who became the Queen of Spain. </p><p>Joseph I's sudden death at the age of 32 was a shock to Europe, particularly as he was in the midst of several important military campaigns. He was succeeded by his brother Charles VI, who went on to become one of the most significant rulers of the Habsburg Empire.</p><p>Despite his short time on the throne, Joseph I's reign had a significant impact on Habsburg history. He implemented several reforms that aimed to modernize and centralize the administration of the empire, which helped strengthen Habsburg rule in the long term. He also supported the work of composers such as Antonio Vivaldi and Johann Joseph Fux, who contributed to Vienna's reputation as a hub for music and culture. While his military campaigns against the Ottoman Empire were successful, they also had devastating consequences for the local populations, leading to widespread violence and displacement. Nevertheless, Joseph I remains a highly regarded figure in Austrian history, remembered for his patronage of the arts and his contributions to the expansion and consolidation of the Habsburg territories.</p><p>Joseph I was also known for his efforts to foster religious tolerance within the Empire. He issued a series of decrees that granted greater freedom of worship to Protestants and Jews, reflecting the influence of his mother's more liberal views on religion. Under his leadership, the University of Vienna was also reformed to become a more secular institution that welcomed scholars of all backgrounds.</p><p>Despite his youth and relative inexperience, Joseph I was a popular ruler who earned the respect of his subjects and contemporaries. He was praised for his intelligence, his sense of justice, and his willingness to listen to the advice of others. His death was widely mourned, and he was widely regarded as a tragic figure who was taken from the world too soon.</p><p>Today, Joseph I is remembered as one of the most important figures in Austrian history, a ruler who helped shape the course of the Habsburg Empire in the early 18th century. His legacy includes not only military victories and administrative reforms, but also a commitment to religious tolerance and cultural enrichments that helped make Vienna one of the great centers of European civilization.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of smallpox.

personality.


					</p><p>However, Elmyr de Hory was known not only for his tragic end but also for his talent as an artist and his notorious career as a forger of paintings.

His life and art inspired the famous book and documentary film "F for Fake" by Orson Welles.</p><p>Hory's early life was characterized by a love for the arts, and he went on to attend art school in Budapest after completing his mandatory military service.

Hory moved to Paris and began selling his fake paintings to affluent collectors with great success.

Hory's forgeries became so well-regarded that some collectors even preferred them to the original works.

He would begin by researching the artist's style and subject matter, and then would often use contemporary materials and techniques to create the forgery. In some cases, he would even reuse old canvases and tweak them to fit the style of the artist he was imitating. Hory's attention to detail and mastery of multiple art styles enabled him to create forgeries that would pass even rigorous scrutiny by experts in the field.</p><p>Hory's forgeries have been the subject of numerous exhibitions and retrospectives, and his life and work continue to be studied by art historians and collectors today.
