Bogart is best known for his roles in films such as "Casablanca" (1942), "The Maltese Falcon" (1941), and "The African Queen" (1951), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was also known for his distinctive voice, which became a trademark of his performances. Despite his success, Bogart was known for his rebellious and independent spirit, leading him to clash with studio executives and directors throughout his career. He died of esophageal cancer at the age of 57.</p><p>Bogart's parents were affluent but distant, with his father being a surgeon and his mother a famous commercial illustrator. He was expelled from multiple schools throughout his childhood and eventually dropped out of high school. Bogart enlisted in the Navy during World War I, but his service was cut short due to a debilitating injury. After the war, he worked odd jobs to make ends meet and eventually stumbled into acting through his connections in the theater world. </p><p>Bogart's breakthrough role came in 1941 with "The Maltese Falcon," which marked the start of his long-standing collaboration with director John Huston. He went on to star in several other films directed by Huston, including "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948) and "Key Largo" (1948). </p><p>Off-screen, Bogart was known for his tumultuous relationships, particularly with women. He was married four times, most famously to actress Lauren Bacall, whom he met on the set of "To Have and Have Not" (1944). </p><p>Bogart's legacy as an iconic actor has endured long after his death. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him as the greatest male star of classic American cinema.</p><p>Bogart was a prominent figure in Hollywood during the Golden Age of cinema. He was known for his portrayals of tough, cynical characters with a code of honor. Despite his tough image on screen, Bogart was a well-read and intellectual man who loved to discuss literature and politics. He was involved in the Civil Rights Movement and was an outspoken supporter of the Democratic Party. In addition to his acting career, Bogart was also a producer and founded his own production company, Santana Productions. He used this platform to produce films that he believed in, including his final film, "The Harder They Fall" (1956), which was a searing indictment of the corrupt world of boxing. Bogart's death at the age of 57 was a shock to the film industry and his legions of fans. His performances continue to inspire actors and movie enthusiasts all over the world to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(July 21, 1902		New Orleans-September 17, 1959			New York City)

	
		a.k.a. Simeon, Omer

	
was
an American
musician.


					</p><p>He was a jazz clarinetist who was active during the Swing era. Simeon was known for his sweet and mellow tone on the clarinet and played with various notable jazz ensembles of his time. He began his professional music career in his hometown of New Orleans, where he played alongside jazz legends such as Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver. In the 1920s, he moved to Chicago and became part of the thriving jazz scene there. He subsequently played with Earl Hines and other noted jazz bands. In the later years of his career, he moved to New York City, where he became a popular session musician and recorded with various jazz artists, including his former bandmates from Chicago. Despite his contributions to the jazz scene, Simeon's name is not as well-known as some of his contemporaries.</p><p>He formed his own quartet during the 1930s and gained a loyal following for his soulful and expressive playing style. Simeon's rich tone on the clarinet was often compared to that of Benny Goodman, who was at the height of his popularity during this time. Simeon's work as a sideman and session musician brought him into contact with many other prominent jazz musicians of the day, including Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. He also appeared in a number of films during the 1940s and 1950s, lending his musical talents to Hollywood productions. Despite struggling with health problems and financial difficulties towards the end of his life, Simeon continued to perform and record until his death in 1959. Today, he is remembered as a gifted and versatile jazz musician who contributed significantly to the evolution of the clarinet as a solo instrument.</p><p>Simeon's playing style was influenced by traditional New Orleans jazz, which placed a great emphasis on collective improvisation and ensemble playing. He was known for his ability to blend seamlessly with other musicians and create a cohesive and swinging sound. Simeon was also proficient on other instruments, including the saxophone and the trumpet, and was known to switch between them during performances. His versatility and adaptability made him a sought-after player in the jazz world.</p><p>Despite his talents, Simeon faced discrimination and obstacles as a Black musician during the Jim Crow era. He was often excluded from all-White jazz ensembles and faced segregation in performance venues and other areas of public life. However, he persevered and continued to make music that spoke to people of all backgrounds.</p><p>Today, Simeon's contributions to jazz are celebrated by music historians and enthusiasts. His recordings with Earl Hines and other bands continue to be cherished by jazz collectors, and his innovative playing style has influenced generations of clarinetists. Simeon's life and career serve as a testament to the resilience and creativity of Black musicians during a challenging period in American history.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Thomas William Smith or Thomas Smith

	
was
an American
actor, singer and dancer.


					</p><p>Smith was well-known for his role as "Ice" in the iconic movie musical "West Side Story" (1961). He also appeared in other movies such as "Carousel" (1956) and "The Young Savages" (1961), as well as numerous stage productions on and off-Broadway.</p><p>In addition to his work in entertainment, Smith was also involved in civil rights activism and was a close friend of Martin Luther King Jr. He marched with King in Selma, Alabama, and wrote and sang the song "Colors of the Wind" in support of the American Indian Movement. </p><p>Smith battled with drug addiction throughout his career and tragically died of AIDS-related complications in 1988 at the age of 52.</p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Tucker Smith was recognized for his talent as a performer, earning several award nominations for his work. He was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance in the 1960 musical "Greenwillow" and also received a Theatre World Award for his role in "The Sound of Music" (1961).</p><p>Smith was a versatile performer, who not only acted, sang and danced but was also skilled at martial arts. He taught karate in his spare time and was a black belt in Shotokan karate.</p><p>In addition to his activism and performance work, Smith also had a brief stint in politics, running for Congress in California in 1976 as a Democrat. Although he did not win, he remained involved in political campaigning and activism throughout his life.</p><p>Tucker Smith's legacy lives on through his memorable performances in classic films and stage productions, as well as his contributions to civil rights and activism.</p><p>He was born into a family of performers, and his parents were both actors. Smith took to the stage himself at a young age, making his Broadway debut in the 1953 production of "Maggie" at just 17 years old. He went on to perform in several other Broadway shows, including "Shinbone Alley" and "Bye Bye Birdie" before landing his breakthrough role in "West Side Story". </p><p>Smith's talent and charisma earned him many fans, and he was often compared to other leading men of the era such as Elvis Presley and James Dean. However, his struggles with addiction and health issues cut his career short. In addition to his battle with drug addiction, he also suffered from epilepsy and was involved in a serious car accident in the early 1980s that left him with a broken neck.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Smith remained committed to his passions and continued to perform and advocate for causes he believed in until his death. He was remembered by many as a kind and generous person who brought joy and passion to everything he did.</p><p></p><p>
