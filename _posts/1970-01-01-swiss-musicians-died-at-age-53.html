(July 5, 1750		Geneva-October 14, 1803			London)

	
		a.k.a. Aime Argand

	
was
a Swiss
physicist and chemist.


					</p><p>He is best known for inventing the Argand lamp in 1780, which had a much brighter and more efficient flame than any lamp of its time. The lamp featured a hollow circular wick that allowed air to flow through the center, producing a brighter, more stable flame that used less fuel. It quickly became popular throughout Europe and was used for street lighting, lighthouses, and in homes. Argand also contributed to the development of the voltaic pile, a primitive battery that was an important precursor to modern batteries. He also made important contributions to the field of optics, discovering the phenomenon of interference in light waves. Argand's work had a significant impact on science and technology in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and his inventions continue to influence modern lighting and battery technology.</p><p>Argand was born into a family of watchmakers in Geneva in 1750. He initially apprenticed with his father and later studied mathematics and natural philosophy at the University of Geneva. In 1777, he moved to Paris where he became interested in optics and began experimenting with lenses and mirrors.</p><p>It was during this time that Argand began working on his most famous invention, the Argand lamp. He was inspired by the oil lamps used in Parisian theaters, which had multiple wicks but still produced a dim and uneven light. Argand realized that by creating a single, hollow wick with an airflow, he could greatly improve the lamp's efficiency and luminosity.</p><p>In addition to his work on the Argand lamp and the voltaic pile, Argand also conducted research on the nature of electricity and contributed to understanding the behavior of gases. He corresponded with many scientists of his time, including Benjamin Franklin and Antoine Lavoisier, and was elected to the Royal Society of London in 1784.</p><p>After the French Revolution, Argand moved to London where he continued his scientific pursuits until his death in 1803. His legacy lives on in modern lighting and battery technologies, which have been developed based on his groundbreaking ideas and inventions.</p><p></p><p>

Today, he is remembered as a notable figure in the medical and literary history of Switzerland.</p><p>Dr. Carl Rüedi was born into a family of physicians and grew up in Davos, Switzerland. He received his medical degree from the University of Zurich in 1872 and also studied at the universities of Berlin and Vienna. After completing his studies, he returned to Davos where he began his practice.</p><p>Due to the prevalence of tuberculosis in the area, Dr. Rüedi became interested in its treatment and began to research the disease extensively. He believed that high-altitude climate therapy, which involved patients being placed in a high altitude and low-pressure environment, could help in the treatment of tuberculosis. He established the first sanatorium in the Swiss Alps for tuberculosis patients in Davos in 1877, and later opened another in Arosa in 1889.</p><p>Dr. Rüedi's sanatoriums became popular among the wealthy who sought treatment for the disease. He became known for his compassionate and innovative approach to treating tuberculosis. He was also a pioneer in the use of rest and fresh air for the treatment of the disease.</p><p>Aside from his work in medicine, Dr. Rüedi was also an accomplished writer and poet.
