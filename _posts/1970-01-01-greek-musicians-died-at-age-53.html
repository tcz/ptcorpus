Her unconventional lifestyle, her powerful poetry and her unique acting style made her stand out from the mainstream society of her time.

She often used drugs and alcohol and openly expressed her bisexuality, which was a taboo topic at the time.</p><p>Katerina Gogou's poetry is characterized by its raw, powerful and honest tone. Her poems often dealt with themes of love, freedom, and social injustice, and were heavily influenced by the Beat Generation literature and the American counterculture movement. Gogou was also a talented actor and playwright, and her plays were performed in many of the alternative theaters that emerged in Athens during the 1970s.</p><p>Despite her short life and tragic end, Katerina Gogou left a lasting influence on Greek art and culture. She is remembered as an iconoclastic rebel and a true representation of the counterculture spirit that permeated the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=27301083" title="Wikipedia article about Katerina Gogou">Katerina Gogou on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/chinese-actors-died-at-age-35.html' title='Chinese actors died at age 35'><strong>Chinese actors died at age 35</strong> List of the top 1 Chinese actors who died when they were 35</a></li><li><a href='/bosnian-musicians-died-before-turning-18.html' title='Bosnian musicians died before turning 18'><strong>Bosnian musicians died before turning 18</strong> List of the top 1 Bosnian music stars who died before 18</a></li><li><a href='/israeli-musicians-died-at-age-36.html' title='Israeli musicians died at age 36'><strong>Israeli musicians died at age 36</strong> List of the top 3 Israeli music stars who died when they were 36</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/american-actresses-died-in-liver-cancer.html' title='American actresses died in Liver cancer'><strong>American actresses died in Liver cancer</strong> List of the top 6 American actresses who died in Liver cancer</a></li><li><a href='/italian-musicians-born-in-1915.html' title='Italian musicians born in 1915'><strong>Italian musicians born in 1915</strong> List of the top 7 Italian  music stars who died in who were born in 1915</a></li><li><a href='/italian-musicians-died-in-hiv-aids.html' title='Italian musicians died in HIV/AIDS'><strong>Italian musicians died in HIV/AIDS</strong> List of the top 1 Italian music stars who died in HIV/AIDS</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
