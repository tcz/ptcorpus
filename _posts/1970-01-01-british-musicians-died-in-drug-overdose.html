McIntosh's drumming style was heavily influenced by jazz and funk, and helped shape the sound of Average White Band's music.

Despite his short life and career, McIntosh's influence on the world of funk and soul music has endured and his legacy lives on through his recordings and contributions to the genre.</p><p>McIntosh was born in Dundee, Scotland in 1950, and began playing drums at a young age. He showcased his talent early on by playing with various bands in the local music scene, and eventually moved to London in the late 1960s to pursue a career in music. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled drummer and was soon in demand by some of the biggest names in the industry.</p><p>In 1971, McIntosh joined Brian Auger's band Oblivion Express, and recorded several albums with them. He later caught the attention of Paul McCartney, who invited him to join his band Wings. McIntosh played on their album "Red Rose Speedway" and also appeared on several of their live recordings.</p><p>In 1972, McIntosh was recruited by Average White Band as their drummer, and it was with them that he made his biggest impact. The band's fusion of funk, soul, and jazz proved to be a perfect fit for McIntosh's drumming style, and his performances on songs like "Pick Up The Pieces" and "Cut The Cake" are still considered some of the best in funk music.</p><p>McIntosh's sudden death in 1974 was a loss to the music world, but the influence he had on the funk and soul genre is undeniable. His contributions to Average White Band's music have helped shape the sound of funk, and his legacy continues to inspire drummers and musicians to this day.</p><p>McIntosh's work with Average White Band proved to be highly successful, with the band achieving worldwide recognition and success. Their album "AWB" reached the top of the US charts, and "Cut the Cake" produced the hit single "School Boy Crush."

He was highly regarded in the music industry and was considered one of the greatest drummers of his time.</p><p>After McIntosh's death, his legacy continued to shine through his recordings with Average White Band, which continue to be popular with new generations of music lovers.
