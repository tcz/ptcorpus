					</p><p>Boganda was the first Prime Minister of the Central African Republic and is considered as the Father of the Nation. He was born into a humble family and he studied at a seminary school in Brazzaville.

He was also an advocate for education, and believed that it was crucial for the country's development. Under his leadership, the MESAN party launched several initiatives to promote education in the country, including the establishment of schools and scholarships for students.</p><p>Boganda's legacy continues to inspire political and social movements in the Central African Republic and beyond. His emphasis on the inclusion of rural and marginalized populations in the political process, as well as his dedication to fighting poverty and promoting education, continues to be an important part of discussions on development and social justice in the region.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to the country, the Central African Republic celebrates "Barthélemy Boganda Day" every year on March 29, the anniversary of his death.</p><p></p><p>
