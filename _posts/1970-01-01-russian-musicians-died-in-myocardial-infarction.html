He also organized the first American tours of the Bolshoi Ballet and the Moiseyev Dance Company from the Soviet Union. </p><p>Hurok was born in a Jewish family in the Russian Empire and began his career as a theater critic before becoming an impresario. He immigrated to the United States in 1912 and became an American citizen in 1919. Hurok was known for his tenacity and believed that if he believed in the talent of an artist, he could make them successful in America. He died in New York City in 1974 at the age of 85.</p><p>Hurok's success in promoting international artists earned him the title "Mr. Show Business" in the 1950s.

Hurok was known to be very hands-on in his approach, involved in all aspects of an artist's presentation, from costumes to publicity. He had a keen eye for talent and was not afraid to take risks, bringing unknown performers to the United States and helping to launch their careers. In addition to his work as an impresario, Hurok authored a memoir, "Impresario," which was published in 1946.

Hurok was also known for his sharp business sense, negotiating contracts that were highly beneficial to his artists. However, he was not without his critics, who accused him of being difficult to work with and overly controlling.
