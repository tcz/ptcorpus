was
a Bulgarian
poet, critic and translator.


					
			
		His children

						</p><p>Dalchev was one of the most prominent figures of Bulgarian literature in the 20th century. He was known for his modernist poetry and his efforts to revolutionize Bulgarian literature with new ideas and techniques. He wrote poems, essays, and literary criticism, which were translated into several languages across the globe. He was a fierce advocate for free speech and was known for his opposition to the communist regime in Bulgaria.</p><p>Dalchev attended high school in Sofia before studying law and philosophy at the universities of Sofia, Paris and Geneva. In addition to his writing, he also served as an editor for several literary magazines in Bulgaria. He was a recipient of many awards and accolades for his contributions to Bulgarian literature, including the Dimitrov Prize and the Order of Cyril and Methodius.</p><p>Despite his success as a poet and writer, Dalchev led a troubled personal life. He suffered from depression and mental health problems, which were exacerbated by the political turmoil in Bulgaria during his time. He died in 1978 at the age of 73, leaving behind a rich legacy of literary works that continue to inspire readers and writers today.</p><p>Dalchev began his literary career in the 1920s as a member of the literary group "Green". His early works reflected the influence of French symbolism and Bulgarian folk traditions, but he soon moved towards a more experimental and modernist style. He published his first collection of poems, "The Light in the Night", in 1929, which was well-received both by critics and the reading public.</p><p>In the 1930s, Dalchev became associated with the literary movement called "Euphoria", which sought to break away from traditional Bulgarian literature and embrace new styles and ideas. He published several influential collections of poems during this period, including "The Road" (1934), "Vertigo" (1936), and "A Journey" (1940).</p><p>During World War II, Dalchev was forced to go into hiding due to his opposition to the fascist government in Bulgaria. After the war, he was briefly imprisoned by the new communist regime, but was released due to pressure from the literary community. However, he continued to face harassment and censorship throughout his life due to his outspoken views and his refusal to conform to the official ideology.</p><p>Despite these difficulties, Dalchev remained one of the most important literary figures in Bulgaria until his death in 1978. His poetry continues to be celebrated for its originality, lyricism, and depth of feeling, and his influence can be seen in the work of many younger Bulgarian writers.</p><p></p><p>
