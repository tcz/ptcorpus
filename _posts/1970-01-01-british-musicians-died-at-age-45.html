He served as a foreign correspondent for several newspapers and magazines, including The Morning Post and The Westminster Gazette, and his works were published in a number of prestigious publications, such as The New Yorker and The Daily Chronicle. Despite his success, Saki's life was cut short when he was killed in action while serving with the British Army during World War I.</p><p>Saki's childhood was marked by tragedy, as his mother died when he was only two years old. He and his siblings were then raised by their grandmother and aunts, who heavily influenced his writing. Growing up, Saki was an avid reader and developed a passion for writing at an early age. He began publishing his works in various magazines and newspapers while working as a foreign correspondent, and eventually became a full-time writer. </p><p>Saki's style of writing was known for its dark humor and macabre themes. He often used animals in his stories as inanimate objects, with characters such as dogs and cats behaving as if they were human. His most popular works include "The Open Window," "The Interlopers," and "The Storyteller." </p><p>Despite his success, Saki struggled with personal demons and often felt lonely and isolated.

Saki's influence continues to be felt in literature and popular culture, with his works inspiring numerous adaptations and references in films, television shows, and other works of fiction.

(April 7, 1836		Birkin-March 26, 1882			Oxford)


was
a British
philosopher.


					</p><p>He is known for his influential work in the field of political philosophy, where he espoused a form of liberalism that emphasized positive freedom and the common good. Green studied at Balliol College, Oxford, before becoming a fellow and tutor at the college in 1860. He was appointed the Whyte's Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford in 1878, a position he held until his death. In addition to his academic work, he was also involved in local politics and served as a town councillor in Oxford for many years. His ideas had a profound impact on both British and American political philosophy, and he is considered one of the most important thinkers of the late 19th century. Some of his most important works include "Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation" and "Prolegomena to Ethics".</p><p>Green was a proponent of the idea that the state had a moral responsibility to promote the general welfare of its citizens. He believed that society could only achieve true freedom if individuals had the capacity to develop their own potential, without being hindered by social or economic constraints. Green's theory of positive freedom stressed the need for a just society in which individuals had access to equal opportunities, education and resources. In this sense, Green can be seen as one of the key figures in the development of modern liberalism.</p><p>Green's work also had an impact on the development of idealist philosophy, which was concerned with the nature of reality and the human experience. He argued that philosophy was not just a theoretical discipline, but had a practical application in society. In this sense, Green's work was closely associated with the social and political reform movements of his time, and he was an influential figure in the development of progressive politics.</p><p>Green's influence also extended to the United States, where his ideas were taken up by a number of prominent philosophers and political theorists. His emphasis on the common good and the positive role of the state had a significant impact on American liberalism, and was reflected in the work of thinkers such as John Dewey and Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p><p>Despite his influence and importance, Green's work was not widely recognized in his own time. It was only in the 20th century that his ideas gained broader recognition, and he was acknowledged as a major figure in the development of British philosophy. Today, many scholars continue to study his work, and he remains a key figure in the history of political philosophy. Some of his other important works include "Liberal Legislation and Freedom of Contract", "The Ethics of Aristotle", and "The Works of Jeremy Bentham". Green's legacy is not only his written work, but also his contribution to the development of liberal thought and progressive politics, which continue to shape our society today.</p><p></p><p>

(February 13, 1849		Belgravia-January 24, 1895			London)

	
		also known as Lord Randolph Henry Spencer-Churchill or Lord Randolph Henry Spencer-Churchill PC

	
was
a British
politician.


					
			
		His children
		are
		called
		Winston Churchill and John Strange Spencer-Churchill.

						</p><p>Lord Randolph Churchill was a prominent Conservative Party member, who served as the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1886. He was known for his sharp wit, powerful oratory, and his opposition to the policies of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. Churchill is widely credited with modernizing and revitalizing the Conservative Party during the late 19th century. However, his political career was cut short when he was forced to resign in 1887 due to health concerns.</p><p>Outside of politics, Churchill was a successful journalist and businessman. He was the founder and editor of the Conservative-leaning newspaper, The National Observer. In addition, he was a member of the board of directors for several major corporations, including British South Africa Company and the Imperial British East Africa Company.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Churchill struggled with his health throughout his life. He suffered from a mysterious illness that caused fatigue and episodes of unconsciousness. His condition worsened over the years, leading to his premature death at the age of 45.</p><p>Churchill was born into a prominent aristocratic family, with a long history of military and political service. His father was the Duke of Marlborough, and his mother was Lady Frances Anne Emily Vane, the daughter of the 3rd Marquess of Londonderry. Churchill received his education at Eton College and Merton College, Oxford, but he left school early without completing his degree. </p><p>As a politician, Churchill was known for his advocacy of social reform and his opposition to Irish Home Rule. He was also a strong supporter of imperial expansion and played a key role in the partition of Africa at the Berlin Conference in 1884-1885. However, his uncompromising stance on these issues often put him at odds with his colleagues in the Conservative Party.</p><p>Despite his short tenure in government, Churchill's impact on British politics was significant. He championed a more aggressive foreign policy and a more assertive approach to British imperial interests, which would become a hallmark of Conservative Party policy for decades to come. His legacy was also carried on by his son, Winston Churchill, who would become one of the most famous politicians and statesmen in British history.</p><p>Lord Randolph Churchill's marriage to American heiress Jennie Jerome, later Lady Randolph Churchill, was a highly publicized and scandalous event in its time. The couple had a tumultuous relationship, with both parties engaging in extramarital affairs. Despite this, they remained married until his death in 1895. In addition to his political and business pursuits, Churchill was also an avid racehorse owner and breeder. He founded the Westerham Press, a printing press that produced his own publications as well as those of other authors. Churchill's early death was attributed to syphilis, a disease he likely contracted years earlier. His death left a void in British political life, and he is still remembered as a brilliant, if controversial, figure in British history.</p><p></p><p>
