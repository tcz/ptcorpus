						Robert Schumann was born in Zwickau, Germany and showed great talent in music from an early age. He received his first musical education from his father and then went on to study law at the University of Leipzig. However, his passion for music continued to grow and he eventually abandoned his legal studies to focus solely on music.</p><p>As a composer, Schumann is known for his contributions to the Romantic music movement, especially in the realms of piano music and art song. Some of his most famous works include Kinderszenen, Carnaval, and Dichterliebe.</p><p>In addition to composing, Schumann was also a prominent music critic and founded the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik in 1834. He used his platform to promote the works of fellow composers such as Chopin and Brahms.</p><p>Schumann's mental health began to decline in the late 1830s and he suffered from severe mood swings and periods of depression. He was admitted to a mental institution in 1854 and remained there until his death in 1856.</p><p>Despite his personal struggles, Schumann's influence on Romantic music has been significant and his compositions continue to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=44887" title="Wikipedia article about Robert Alexander Schumann">Robert Alexander Schumann on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/english-musicians-died-in-ovarian-cancer.html' title='English musicians died in Ovarian cancer'><strong>English musicians died in Ovarian cancer</strong> List of the top 3 English music stars who died in Ovarian cancer</a></li><li><a href='/spanish-musicians-died-at-age-74.html' title='Spanish musicians died at age 74'><strong>Spanish musicians died at age 74</strong> List of the top 16 Spanish music stars who died when they were 74</a></li><li><a href='/spanish-musicians-died-at-age-71.html' title='Spanish musicians died at age 71'><strong>Spanish musicians died at age 71</strong> List of the top 15 Spanish music stars who died when they were 71</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swiss-musicians-died-at-age-36.html' title='Swiss musicians died at age 36'><strong>Swiss musicians died at age 36</strong> List of the top 1 Swiss music stars who died when they were 36</a></li><li><a href='/bangladeshi-musicians-died-before-turning-40.html' title='Bangladeshi musicians died before turning 40'><strong>Bangladeshi musicians died before turning 40</strong> List of the top 29 Bangladeshi music stars who died before 40</a></li><li><a href='/colombian-musicians-died-at-age-59.html' title='Colombian musicians died at age 59'><strong>Colombian musicians died at age 59</strong> List of the top 1 Colombian music stars who died when they were 59</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
