(February 26, 1910		Noordwijk-January 12, 1932			London)


was
a Dutch
personality.


					</p><p>Noteboom was an accomplished chess player and is considered one of the strongest Dutch players of all time. He won the Dutch championship twice, in 1931 and 1932, and was known for his aggressive and imaginative play style. Noteboom also had a successful international chess career, with strong showings at tournaments in Belgium, England, and Switzerland. His untimely death at the age of 21 was a great loss to the world of chess, and he remains a celebrated figure in the game's history.</p><p>Noteboom was born into a family of six children in Noordwijk, Netherlands. He learned the game of chess at the age of 13 from his father, and quickly developed a passion for the game. Noteboom's talent was soon recognized by other players and he began competing in local tournaments. He continued to improve and eventually moved to Amsterdam to study mathematics at the University of Amsterdam, where he also competed in chess at a higher level.</p><p>Noteboom was known for his daring and unconventional approach to chess, and he was not afraid to take risks in the game. He was a pioneer of the Modern Defense, a chess opening that was considered unorthodox at the time. Noteboom's style of play won him many admirers, and he was widely regarded as one of the most promising young players of his generation.</p><p>Unfortunately, Noteboom's life was cut short when he fell ill with pneumonia during a trip to London to participate in a chess tournament. He passed away on January 12, 1932 at the age of 21, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most talented and innovative chess players of his time.</p><p>Noteboom's legacy continues to inspire chess players to this day, and his contributions to the game have not been forgotten. The Noteboom Variation in the Slav Defense opening is named after him, and his games are still studied by aspiring chess players. In 2010, on the centenary of his birth, the Daniel Noteboom Foundation was established to promote chess in the Netherlands and honor his memory. Noteboom is remembered not only for his skill as a chess player, but also for his courage and determination in the face of adversity. Despite his short life, he achieved great things in the world of chess, and his legacy continues to live on.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by pneumonia.

(September 17, 1764		Groningen-April 20, 1786			York)


was
a Dutch
astronomer.


					</p><p>Despite suffering from profound deafness, John Goodricke made significant discoveries in the field of astronomy. He is best known for his work on variable stars, which are stars that experience periods of brightness and dimness. Goodricke studied the eclipsing binary star Algol and was able to deduce that its brightness was due to one star passing in front of the other. He also discovered the periodic nature of the star Delta Cephei, which led to the measurement of astronomical distances using a method known as the cosmic distance ladder. Although he died at the young age of 21, John Goodricke's contributions to astronomy helped lay the foundation for future discoveries in the field.</p><p>Goodricke was born into an affluent family and received a private education at home. As a child, he contracted scarlet fever, which left him deaf. Despite this, he excelled in mathematics and science, developing a keen interest in astronomy from a young age. </p><p>In 1781, he became the first person to propose a mechanism for eclipsing binary stars, which was later confirmed by subsequent observations. In his short but productive career, Goodricke also made significant contributions to the study of the Pleiades star cluster, determining the age of the cluster and identifying several variable stars within it.</p><p>Goodricke was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his contributions to astronomy. He maintained correspondence with other leading astronomers of his time and was widely respected for his work. Today, the John Goodricke Memorial Prize is awarded annually by the British Astronomical Association to recognize outstanding contributions to the observation or study of variable stars.</p><p>In addition to his work in astronomy, John Goodricke was also an accomplished linguist and was fluent in several languages, including French, German, Italian, and Spanish. He was also known for his love of music and played several instruments, including the flute and the piano. Goodricke's scientific achievements were cut short when he contracted pneumonia and died at the age of 21. However, his legacy continues to inspire generations of astronomers who continue to build upon his work and make new discoveries in the field of variable stars. Today, Goodricke's name is remembered in several astronomical terms, including the Goodricke-Pigott Observatory and the Goodricke method for calculating the brightness of stars. Despite his short life, John Goodricke made a significant impact on astronomy and his contributions continue to shape our understanding of the universe.</p><p></p><p>
