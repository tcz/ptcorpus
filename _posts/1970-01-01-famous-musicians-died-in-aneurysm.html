(January 1, 1917		Amsterdam-March 9, 2004			Laren, Gelderland)

	
		a.k.a. Mol, Albert

	
was
a Dutch
actor.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Kika Mol.

						</p><p>Albert Mol was a multifaceted personality who not only excelled in acting but was also a popular television presenter, writer, and singer. He was trained as an actor at the Toneelschool Amsterdam, and following his graduation, he joined the Nederlandse Comedie, one of the foremost Dutch theatre companies of the time. </p><p>Mol rose to fame with his stage performances in several plays, including 'Othello,' 'King Lear,' and 'The Importance of Being Earnest.' Later, he transitioned to the small screen and became a well-known television host, presenting several shows such as 'Wie van de Drie' and 'Zo is het toevallig ook nog eens een keer.' </p><p>Apart from his successful career in entertainment, Mol was also openly gay and a vocal LGBT rights activist. He wrote a book about his experiences in the closet and coming out called 'Gijzelaar' (Hostage) and even recorded a song called 'The Laughing Policeman,' which humorously mocked the Dutch police's obsession with arresting homosexuals. </p><p>In recognition of his contributions to Dutch culture, Mol was awarded several honours during his lifetime, including the Silver medal of the City of Amsterdam and the Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau. He remained active in the entertainment industry until the last years of his life, performing on stage until shortly before his death in March 2004.</p><p>In addition to his talents as an actor and presenter, Albert Mol also made a name for himself as a writer. He wrote several plays, including 'De Kat op de Snelweg' (The Cat on the Highway) and 'Dubbele Harten' (Double Hearts), which were met with critical acclaim. He also wrote a number of novels, including 'Knielen op een bed violen' (Kneeling on a Bed of Violets) which was later adapted into a successful film. Mol was not only a pioneering figure in Dutch entertainment; he was also a trailblazer for the LGBT community. He openly discussed his own experiences as a homosexual man and helped to raise awareness of LGBT rights and issues in the Netherlands. For his contributions to the gay community, he was awarded the Bob Angelo Medal in 1983, an award named after a pioneering Dutch gay rights activist. Despite facing some initial pushback, Mol's courage and charisma helped to change attitudes towards homosexuality in Dutch society. Today, he is remembered not only as a beloved entertainer but also as a pioneer and activist who helped to make the Netherlands more inclusive and accepting.</p><p>Throughout his career, Albert Mol worked in a variety of mediums, including film. He appeared in several movies, such as 'Fanfare,' 'Ciske de Rat,' and 'The Assault.' In 'Fanfare,' Mol played the role of a trumpet player, which also allowed him to showcase his musical talents. He also lent his voice to the Dutch version of Disney's 'Robin Hood' in 1973, portraying the character of Friar Tuck.</p><p>Aside from his artistic pursuits, Mol was also an avid traveler and adventurer. He went on several expeditions to the Himalayas, where he climbed mountains and trekked through remote regions. He chronicled his travels in a book called 'Hamer en Sikkel in de Himalaja' (Hammer and Sickle in the Himalayas).</p><p>Albert Mol's lasting legacy extends beyond his artistic and personal accomplishments. He is regarded as an icon for the Dutch LGBT community, inspiring many with his bravery, candor, and dedication to social justice. In 2013, the Amsterdam Museum mounted an exhibition dedicated to his life and work, titled "Albert Mol - Een Leven vol Avonturen" (Albert Mol - A Life Full of Adventures).</p><p>Mol was also known for his unique and flamboyant fashion sense, often sporting colorful and eccentric outfits. He once famously attended the Cannes Film Festival wearing a full, traditional Dutch costume. Mol's style and personality made him a beloved figure not only in entertainment but also in Dutch popular culture as a whole. In addition, Mol was a polyglot and spoke several languages fluently, which served him well in his travels and international career. His work continues to be celebrated in the Netherlands, and his legacy as an entertainer, writer, activist, and adventurer endures as a testament to a life filled with passion, creativity, and social impact.</p><p></p><p>

was
a British

						</p><p>Flanders is best known for his partnership with Donald Swann, with whom he wrote and performed comedic songs, most famously "The Hippopotamus Song (Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud)". He also wrote a number of plays, including "The Mating Game" and "A Piece of Cake". Flanders began his career in the Army during World War II, before moving on to work in radio and then television. He passed away at the age of 53 due to a brain hemorrhage while on holiday in Wales. Despite his relatively short career, Flanders left behind a lasting legacy in British comedy and entertainment.</p><p>Flanders was born into a family of writers and journalists, and he initially pursued a career in journalism himself. However, his interest in performing led him to join the Army's entertainment division during World War II, where he first met Swann. The two began collaborating on comedic songs and sketches, which they eventually performed on stage and in various media.</p><p>In addition to his work with Swann, Flanders also wrote and performed solo projects, including a one-man show based on the life of Oscar Wilde. He also wrote and appeared in several films and TV shows, including the British comedy series "At Last the 1948 Show".</p><p>Flanders was known for his clever wordplay and sharp wit, and his comedic songs and sketches often satirized British society and politics. He was awarded a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in 1973 for his contributions to the arts.</p><p>After his death, Flanders' daughter Stephanie became a prominent journalist and broadcaster, serving as the BBC's economics editor and later as head of economics at Bloomberg News. His other daughter, Laura, is a progressive political commentator and talk show host in the United States.</p><p>Flanders was diagnosed with polio at the age of 21, which resulted in him having to use crutches for the rest of his life. Despite this, he continued to perform and even incorporated his disability into his comedy sketches. He was known for his irreverent sense of humor and his ability to make audiences laugh at themselves and their own prejudices.</p><p>In addition to his work in comedy, Flanders was an active member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and was involved in various other political causes throughout his life. He was a supporter of the Labour Party and campaigned for their candidates during elections.</p><p>Flanders' legacy continues to be felt in British comedy and entertainment today. His partnership with Swann is still celebrated for its clever wordplay and satirical humor, and his solo work continues to inspire new generations of performers. Flanders is remembered as a talented writer, performer, and social commentator who left an indelible mark on British culture.</p><p>Flanders and Swann's most famous song, "The Hippopotamus Song (Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud)", was first performed in 1957 and quickly became a hit in the UK and beyond. Other popular comedic songs by the duo include "The Gasman Cometh" and "The Gnu Song", both of which showcased Flanders' knack for wordplay and Swann's musical talents.</p><p>In addition to his work in comedy and entertainment, Flanders was also an accomplished writer of plays and musicals. "The Mating Game", which he co-wrote with Donald Swann, was a hit on London's West End in the 1960s, while "A Piece of Cake" was a popular radio play that was later adapted for television.</p><p>Flanders is also remembered for his contributions to the world of vocal harmony singing. He was a member of a small, informal group called The Ivy League, which included other notable British performers such as John Dankworth and Cleo Laine.</p><p>Despite his success and popularity as a performer and writer, Flanders was known for his humility and lack of ego. He once famously said, "If people leave a performance saying, 'What a wonderful show', to each other, and not knowing the names of the performers, then I have done my job."</p><p></p><p>
