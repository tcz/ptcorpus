(September 18, 1917		Chicago-June 16, 1960			San Francisco)


was
an American
philosopher.


					</p><p>He is best known for his book "The Imperium of Yockey," which advocates for a pan-European, fascist state to counterbalance the power of the United States and Soviet Union. Yockey was heavily influenced by the philosophy of Oswald Spengler and sought to create a new cultural and political movement that would overthrow the prevailing liberal-democratic order. He was also associated with far-right groups in the United States and Europe, including the German-American Bund and the neo-fascist National Renaissance Party. Yockey died by suicide in a San Francisco jail while awaiting trial on charges of passport fraud. Despite his controversial views, his ideas have continued to influence far-right and fascist movements around the world.</p><p>Yockey was born in a Catholic family and attended the University of Michigan, where he was involved in far-right student organizations. After graduation, he traveled extensively throughout Europe and was deeply affected by the devastation of World War II. Yockey believed that the traditional nation-state was no longer a viable political unit and that a new, pan-European entity was necessary to preserve European culture and values.</p><p>In addition to "The Imperium of Yockey," he also wrote "The Proclamation of London," a political manifesto that called for the establishment of a European federal state. Yockey's ideas were not widely accepted during his lifetime, but his work has since gained a following among far-right and nationalist groups.</p><p>Yockey's association with extremist organizations and his advocacy for fascist ideology have led many to condemn his ideas. However, his influence on contemporary far-right political movements cannot be denied, and he remains a figure of interest to scholars of political philosophy and extremism.</p><p></p><p>
