(October 7, 1900		Munich-May 23, 1945			Lüneburg)

	
		a.k.a. Himmler, Reichsheini or Heinrich Luitpold Himmler

	
was
a German
politician and agronomist.


					
			
		He had
		four
		children,
		Gudrun Burwitz, Nanette Dorothea Potthast, Gerhard von Ahe and Helge Potthast.

						</p><p>Heinrich Himmler is widely regarded as one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany, second only to Adolf Hitler himself. He joined the Nazi party in 1923 and quickly rose through the ranks to become head of the SS, or Schutzstaffel, in 1929. The SS was a powerful paramilitary organization that played a key role in the Nazi regime's atrocities during World War II, including the Holocaust.</p><p>In addition to his role in the SS, Himmler was also responsible for the implementation of the "Final Solution," the Nazi plan to exterminate European Jews. He oversaw the construction and operation of concentration camps and played a key role in the organization of mass deportations of Jews and other groups deemed undesirable by the Nazi regime.</p><p>Despite his many atrocities, Himmler was also known for his interest in occultism and mysticism. He believed in the idea of a "master race" and actively promoted the study of ancient Germanic culture and mythology. In addition to his political and ideological pursuits, Himmler was also a trained agronomist and oversaw several agricultural initiatives intended to support the Nazi regime's war effort.</p><p>Himmler's suicide in 1945 came at the end of the war, as Allied forces closed in on Germany. After the war, he was declared a war criminal and many of his associates in the Nazi regime were tried and convicted for their role in the atrocities committed during the war.</p><p>Himmler's early life was marked by a fascination with German nationalism and anti-Semitism. After completing his secondary education, he studied agriculture and took up a number of different jobs before joining the Nazi party.In addition to his work in the SS, Himmler was also instrumental in the creation of the Gestapo, the secret police force that hunted down and arrested individuals deemed to be enemies of the Nazi regime.</p><p>Himmler's tenure as head of the SS was marked by a ruthless pursuit of power and a willingness to use any means necessary to maintain his position. He oversaw the creation of a vast network of concentration and extermination camps across Europe, and was personally responsible for ordering the deaths of millions of people, including Jews, Romani, homosexuals, and political dissidents.</p><p>Despite his brutal reputation, Himmler was also known for his love of animals and his support of conservation efforts. He fancied himself an amateur ornithologist and was even involved in the creation of a national park in Poland.</p><p>After the war, Himmler's remains were buried in an unmarked grave in an undisclosed location, and his legacy continues to be a subject of intense debate and speculation among historians and scholars.</p><p>Himmler was known for his obsession with physical fitness and health. He believed that the Aryan race should be physically fit and healthy, and promoted the idea of "race hygiene." He established an organization called the "Lebensborn" which encouraged pure-blooded Aryans to have children with each other. Himmler himself was a vegetarian and promoted the use of alternative medicine, such as homeopathy and herbal remedies. </p><p>In addition to his political and military roles, Himmler was also involved in the arts. He was a supporter of the German theater and music, and oversaw the creation of the Ahnenerbe, an organization that researched ancient history and mythology in an effort to prove the superiority of the Aryan race. The Ahnenerbe also sponsored expeditions to the Arctic and Tibet, among other places, in search of evidence to support Nazi ideology.</p><p>Despite his many interests and pursuits, Heinrich Himmler will always be remembered for his role in one of the darkest chapters of human history. His legacy is one of brutality, oppression, and hate, and serves as a warning to future generations about the dangers of extremism and intolerance.</p><p>It is important to note that Himmler's obsession with race purity went beyond the creation of the "Lebensborn" organization. He also oversaw the implementation of forced sterilization programs targeting those deemed "unfit" to reproduce, including the mentally ill, disabled, and those with hereditary diseases. These programs would eventually lead to hundreds of thousands of people being sterilized against their will.Himmler was also known for his loyalty to Hitler and the Nazi cause, and was described by his peers as being utterly devoted to the Führer. He was famously present at Hitler's bunker in Berlin during the final days of the war, and it was there that he made plans to negotiate a separate peace with the Western Allies. However, his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and he fled the bunker on April 29, 1945, heading south in an attempt to escape the advancing Soviet forces.Himmler's capture by British forces on May 22, 1945, marked the end of his reign of terror. After being interrogated by British authorities, he was found to have ingested a cyanide capsule hidden in his mouth and died the following day.In the decades since his death, Himmler's name has become synonymous with evil and hate. His role in the Holocaust and other atrocities committed by the Nazi regime serve as a reminder of the dangers of extremist ideology and the devastating consequences that can result from the unchecked pursuit of power.</p><p>Himmler's family life was marked by tragedy and scandal. His first daughter, Gudrun Burwitz, remained loyal to her father and his ideology long after the war. She joined a neo-Nazi organization and was involved in several controversial activities throughout her life. Heinrich Himmler's wife, Margarete Himmler, was known for her fierce devotion to her husband and her involvement in the "Lebensborn" organization. However, she was also rumored to have had an affair with a SS officer and was suspected of being involved in an attempt to poison Hitler. Margarete Himmler committed suicide in 1967, reportedly because of guilt over her role in her husband's crimes. </p><p>In addition to the millions who died in the concentration and extermination camps, Himmler's policies caused the deaths of countless others as well. Forced labor camps, which were established to support the Nazi war effort, led to the deaths of thousands of prisoners who worked in dangerous and harsh conditions. The Nazi regime also targeted groups such as homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and disabled individuals, among others, for persecution and extermination.</p><p>Despite his many horrific actions, Himmler was known for being a meticulous record-keeper. His files, which contained detailed information on individuals and actions taken during the war, have been invaluable in the prosecution of war crimes and the preservation of historical memory. Today, researchers and historians continue to study these files in an effort to gain a better understanding of the motivations, actions, and legacy of one of the most notorious figures in modern history.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in suicide.

His theory was based on the idea that any electrical circuit could be represented as a network of interconnected basic circuit elements, and that these elements could be combined in a specific way to create more complex circuits. Cauer's work provided a systematic way of analyzing and synthesizing electrical networks, which allowed engineers to design and build more efficient and effective circuits.</p><p>In addition to his work on network synthesis theory, Cauer also made important contributions to the design of filters, which are essential components in electronic devices that allow signals to be processed and transmitted. He developed a new type of filter, called the Cauer filter, that was more efficient and effective than existing designs and is still used today in many electronic devices.</p><p>Cauer was not only a brilliant mathematician and engineer, but he was also a committed teacher and mentor. He was well-respected by his students and colleagues for his dedication and passion for mathematics and electrical engineering. Many of his students went on to have successful careers in these fields and continued to build upon his legacy.</p><p>Today, Cauer is remembered as one of the most influential figures in the history of electrical engineering and his contributions continue to shape the field. His work on network synthesis theory and filter design laid the foundations for modern electronic devices and have enabled countless technological advancements in the fields of telecommunications, computing, and beyond.</p><p>Cauer's legacy continues to inspire research and innovation in the field of electrical engineering. His ideas on network synthesis theory and filter design have been refined and expanded upon by subsequent researchers, and his name remains well-known among electrical engineers and mathematicians today. In recognition of his contributions, the Technical University of Berlin established the Wilhelm Cauer Prize in 1988. The prize is awarded every two years to researchers who have made significant contributions to the field of network theory and its applications. Cauer's impact on electrical engineering has been far-reaching and long-lasting, and his work remains essential to the development of new technologies and the advancement of modern society.</p><p>In addition to his scholarly work, Cauer was also known for his political views. He was a staunch anti-fascist and critic of the Nazi regime, which ultimately led to his arrest by the Gestapo in 1944. During his imprisonment, he continued to work on mathematical problems and even managed to smuggle his research out of prison to his colleagues. His tragic death in the bombing of Berlin has been seen as a great loss to the field of mathematics, electrical engineering, and the struggle for human rights. Today, he is seen as a symbol of intellectual resistance against tyranny and oppression.</p><p></p><p>
