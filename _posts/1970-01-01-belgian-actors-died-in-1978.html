							Brel is widely regarded as a master of the modern chanson, a French style of music characterized by its poetic lyrics and cabaret style. He rose to fame in the 1950s, with hits such as "Ne me quitte pas" ("Don't Leave Me"), "La chanson des vieux amants" ("The Song of Old Lovers") and "Le Moribond" ("The Dying Man"). His music was infused with deep emotion and social commentary, and he often tackled controversial topics such as death, love, sex, and politics.</p><p>In addition to his music career, Brel was also a celebrated actor, starring in several French films including "La Bande à Bonnot" and "Franz". He also directed and wrote the screenplay for the film "Franz".</p><p>Brel was known for his intense, often theatrical performances and his powerful baritone voice. Despite his international success, he remained a deeply private person and retired from performing in 1967 to focus on his family and writing. He later returned to the stage briefly in the 1970s before his untimely death from lung cancer at the age of 49. His legacy lives on, with many of his songs considered classics of French popular music.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=91751" title="Wikipedia article about Jacques Brel">Jacques Brel on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/filipino-musicians-died-at-age-66.html' title='Filipino musicians died at age 66'><strong>Filipino musicians died at age 66</strong> List of the top 14 Filipino music stars who died when they were 66</a></li><li><a href='/norwegian-actresses-died-in-2006.html' title='Norwegian actresses died in 2006'><strong>Norwegian actresses died in 2006</strong> List of the top 4 Norwegian actresses who died in 2006</a></li><li><a href='/english-actors-died-at-age-18.html' title='English actors died at age 18'><strong>English actors died at age 18</strong> List of the top 1 English actors who died when they were 18</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/indian-musicians-died-at-age-69.html' title='Indian musicians died at age 69'><strong>Indian musicians died at age 69</strong> List of the top 16 Indian music stars who died when they were 69</a></li><li><a href='/south-korean-actors-died-in-1984.html' title='South Korean actors died in 1984'><strong>South Korean actors died in 1984</strong> List of the top 1 South Korean actors who died in 1984</a></li><li><a href='/mexican-actors-born-in-1925.html' title='Mexican actors born in 1925'><strong>Mexican actors born in 1925</strong> List of the top 8 Mexican actors who were born in 1925</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
