							Merle Oberon was born in Mumbai, India, to a British mother and an Anglo-Indian father. She began her career as a film actress in British films in the 1920s. Oberon moved to Hollywood in the 1930s, where she starred in numerous films, including "The Private Life of Henry VIII," which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. She also received critical acclaim for her role in "Wuthering Heights" opposite Laurence Olivier. In addition to her acting career, Oberon co-produced several films, including "Berlin Express" and "Interval." Despite her success on screen, Oberon faced racial discrimination due to her mixed heritage and often presented herself as a South Asian or Latin American actress to avoid prejudice. Oberon passed away in Malibu in 1979 at the age of 68.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=175854" title="Wikipedia article about Merle Oberon">Merle Oberon on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/australian-actors-died-before-turning-21.html' title='Australian actors died before turning 21'><strong>Australian actors died before turning 21</strong> List of the top 19 Australian actors who died before they turned 21</a></li><li><a href='/brazilian-actresses-born-in-1959.html' title='Brazilian actresses born in 1959'><strong>Brazilian actresses born in 1959</strong> List of the top 14 Brazilian actresses who were born in 1959</a></li><li><a href='/famous-musicians-died-in-viral-infection.html' title='Famous musicians died in Viral Infection'><strong>Famous musicians died in Viral Infection</strong> List of the top 1 Famous music stars who died in Viral Infection</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/indian-actors-died-in-2001.html' title='Indian actors died in 2001'><strong>Indian actors died in 2001</strong> List of the top 13 Indian actors who died in 2001</a></li><li><a href='/chilean-actresses-died-in-2010.html' title='Chilean actresses died in 2010'><strong>Chilean actresses died in 2010</strong> List of the top 2 Chilean actresses who died in 2010</a></li><li><a href='/famous-actresses-died-in-poison.html' title='Famous actresses died in Poison'><strong>Famous actresses died in Poison</strong> List of the top 2 Famous actresses who died in Poison</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
