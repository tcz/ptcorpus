was
an Afghan
writer, poet, politician, painter and linguist.


					</p><p>He was one of the greatest literary figures in the history of Central Asia and the Persian-speaking world. Nava'i was fluent in several languages and he wrote poems, epics, and prose in Persian, Turkish, and Chaghatai (a Turkic language). He is often credited with the revitalization of the Turkic literary tradition and the formation of the Uzbek language. As a politician, he served as a high-ranking official in the court of several Timurid princes and he was instrumental in the formation of the Uzbek state in the late 15th century. Nava'i was also a skilled painter and calligrapher who created beautiful illuminated manuscripts. His legacy continues to inspire and influence scholars, writers, and artists in the region today.</p><p>Nava'i's works include a divan (collection of poems), various masnavis (long narrative poems), and the notable Chagatai-language philosophical treatise Muhakamat al-lughatayn (The Dispute Between Two Languages). He also translated several works from Arabic and Persian into Chagatai and from Chagatai into Persian. His masterpiece, the Khamsa-yi Nizami, is a quintet of five narrative poems inspired by the work of the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi, and includes Layli and Majnun, a tragic love story that has since become a classic in the Persian-speaking world. </p><p>Nava'i's influence extends beyond literature and politics. He was a patron of the arts and sciences, sponsoring the construction of public buildings, schools, and libraries. In addition to his mastery of calligraphy and painting, he was also skilled in music and astronomy. His impact on the development of Central Asian culture and identity is immeasurable, and his writings and ideas continue to shape the region today.</p><p></p><p>
