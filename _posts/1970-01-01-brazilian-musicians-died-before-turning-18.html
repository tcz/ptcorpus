(April 5, 2015-April 24, 2014			Rio de Janeiro)

	
		a.k.a. Paulo Malhães

	
was
a Brazilian
military officer.


					</p><p>Malhaes played a crucial role in Brazil's military dictatorship that lasted from 1964 to 1985. He was part of the Brazilian intelligence agency known as DOI-CODI, which was responsible for capturing, interrogating, and torturing political dissidents who opposed the government. In 2014, Malhaes drew international attention when he admitted to participating in some of the dictatorship's most brutal and notorious torture sessions. His confession led to renewed discussion and public outrage over the dictatorship's human rights abuses. Malhaes died a few days after his confession, and his death raised suspicions of foul play, but an autopsy revealed that he died of a heart attack.</p><p>After the end of the military dictatorship, Malhaes became a businessman and a politician, serving as a councilman in his hometown of Nova Friburgo. In 2012, he was briefly detained and had his house searched as part of an investigation into crimes committed during the dictatorship, but he was released due to lack of evidence. His confession in 2014 came as a surprise to many, as he had previously been unapologetic for his actions during the dictatorship. Malhaes' death put an end to any potential legal action against him and provoked mixed reactions from Brazilians. While some saw him as a monster who had finally admitted to his crimes, others saw him as a fragile old man who had been haunted by his past. Today, his legacy remains controversial, with some calling for him to be remembered as a human rights violator and others as a defender of Brazilian democracy.</p><p>Malhaes was born in Rio de Janeiro to a military family, and he followed in his father's footsteps by joining the army at a young age. He rose through the ranks and was eventually assigned to DOI-CODI, where he became known for his ruthlessness and expertise in torture techniques. Malhaes was involved in the abduction and torture of numerous political dissidents, including members of the Brazilian Communist Party and student activists.</p><p>After his confession in 2014, Malhaes expressed remorse for his actions during the dictatorship, saying that he had been "brainwashed" by propaganda and had only followed orders. However, many human rights activists and survivors of the dictatorship criticized his attempt to absolve himself of responsibility. They argued that Malhaes had been a willing participant in the regime's atrocities and that he should have been held accountable for his crimes.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, Malhaes' death brought renewed attention to Brazil's history of dictatorship and human rights abuses. Many Brazilians continue to grapple with the difficult legacy of this period in the country's history, and the debate over Malhaes' role in that legacy is likely to continue for years to come.</p><p></p><p>
