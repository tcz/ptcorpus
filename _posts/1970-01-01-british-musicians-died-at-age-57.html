was
a British
author, novelist and writer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his heroic and epic fantasy novels, such as "Legend" and "Waylander".

He passed away in 2006 at the age of 57.</p><p>Gemmell was born in west London and grew up in a tough South London housing estate. He left school early and worked as a labourer, a lorry driver, and a nightclub bouncer before turning to writing. He drew on his own experiences of violence and hardship in his fiction, creating highly realistic and engaging characters that readers could root for. Gemmell's characters often found themselves facing impossible odds, but they persevered through sheer force of will and determination. His gripping tales of adventure and heroism were popular with readers of all ages and backgrounds. Gemini's legacy lives on through the David Gemmell Awards for Fantasy, which celebrate the best in fantasy writing each year.</p><p>To add to David Gemmell's bio, he had a love for martial arts and used his experiences in the field to incorporate them into his writing. He also suffered from dyslexia, which he did not let hold him back from pursuing his love for storytelling. Many of his novels explore themes of redemption, sacrifice, and the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity. Despite his success, Gemmell remained humble and was known for his kind and generous personality.

In addition to his works of fiction, Gemmell also wrote non-fiction books on a variety of topics including historical battles and Celtic mythology. His legacy continues to inspire readers and writers alike, and his impact on the fantasy genre cannot be overstated.</p><p>Gemmell was also an avid reader and cited J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" as a major influence on his own writing. Another important influence was his time as a bouncer, where he learned how to read people and anticipate potential threats. This experience informed his writing of fight scenes and battle sequences, which were praised for their realism and visceral impact. In 2009, a collection of Gemmell's unpublished works was posthumously released as "The Lost Crown", showcasing his skill as a storyteller and his dedication to the craft. Gemmell's legacy continues to inspire writers and readers alike, serving as a reminder of the enduring power of heroic storytelling.</p><p></p><p>

a British
novelist, writer, artist, author, screenwriter and visual artist.


					
			
		He had
		three
		children,
		Sebastian Peake, Fabian and Claire.

						</p><p>Peake is known for his highly imaginative, gothic and surreal works of fiction, including the Gormenghast series, which consists of three books: Titus Groan, Gormenghast and Titus Alone.

Peake worked as a war artist during World War II and was also a successful children's author, producing works such as Captain Slaughterboard Drops Anchor, The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb and Letters from a Lost Uncle. Unfortunately, Peake was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1956 and his health worsened significantly in the years leading up to his death. Despite this, he continued to work on his writing and artwork until the very end of his life.</p><p>Peake spent his childhood in China where his parents were Christian missionaries. He returned to England at the age of eleven to continue his education. He studied at the Royal Academy Schools in London and then worked as a freelance artist and illustrator for newspapers and magazines. Peake's illustration work includes the covers for editions of books such as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. </p><p>In addition to his creative work, Peake was an accomplished athlete and represented England in the 1932 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid as a member of the British ice hockey team. </p><p>Peake's literary works have been highly influential and inspired many writers and artists. He is often compared to other British writers such as J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and Neil Gaiman.

Peake continued to work on his writing and art until his death in 1968. He is remembered as a highly original and innovative artist and writer, whose work continues to inspire and captivate audiences around the world.</p><p>Peake's unique style of writing and art was shaped in part by his experiences growing up in China as the son of missionaries. His father was a doctor and his mother was a teacher, and their work took them all over China. Peake was exposed to Chinese art and culture at a young age, and these influences can be seen in his work. He was also deeply interested in the natural world, and spent hours exploring the countryside around his family's homes in China and later in England.</p><p>Peake's writing and art are characterized by their vivid imagery, Gothic atmosphere, and attention to detail. His novels, in particular the Gormenghast trilogy, are regarded as classics of modern fantasy literature. In addition to his fiction, Peake wrote extensively for children, and his works in this genre are still widely read today.</p><p>Despite his success as a writer and artist, Peake's life was marked by personal tragedy. His first wife, Maeve Gilmore, also a writer and artist, suffered a series of miscarriages and stillbirths, which greatly affected both of them. Peake himself was hospitalized several times in the 1950s and 60s for what was eventually diagnosed as Parkinson's disease. He died in 1968 at the age of 57.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Peake's legacy as a writer, artist, and teacher continues to inspire new generations of artists and writers. His influence can be seen in the works of such diverse creators as China Miéville, Tim Burton, and Guillermo del Toro. In 2013, the centenary of his birth was celebrated with a series of events and exhibitions around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 1577		United Kingdom-August 9, 1634)


was
a British
lawyer and politician.


					</p><p>He was a member of Parliament and served as Attorney General under Kings James I and Charles I. Noy is known for his controversial proposal of the "ship money" tax, which required coastal towns to provide funds for the Royal Navy. This tax was initially met with resistance and became a source of conflict between the monarch and Parliament. Noy was also a prolific legal writer and his works, including "The Compleat Lawyer" and "The Treatise of the Exchequer," were highly regarded in their time. Despite his prominent position in the government and legal profession, Noy died in obscurity and his legacy is often overshadowed by his role in the ship money controversy.</p><p>During his early years, William Noy attended Exeter College, Oxford where he studied law. After completing his studies, he worked as a barrister in London and quickly gained a reputation for his legal expertise. In 1603, he was elected to serve in Parliament for the first time, and over the next few years, he built a relationship with James I. By 1613, Noy had been appointed as a King's Counsel, and in 1616 he became the Recorder of London.</p><p>As Attorney General, Noy was known for his harsh prosecution of religious dissenters, including Puritans, and he played a key role in the persecution of Catholics in England. However, it was his proposal of the ship money tax in 1634 that eventually led to his downfall. The tax was viewed by many as an illegal and unconstitutional levying of funds by the monarch without the consent of Parliament. Upon examination by the courts, it was determined that the tax was indeed illegal, and Noy's reputation was damaged as a result.</p><p>Despite this setback, Noy's works as a legal writer continued to be highly regarded. His Treatise on the Exchequer, in particular, was considered a seminal work in the study of medieval English finance. Noy died in 1634, just a few months after proposing the ship money tax, and his contributions to the field of law have been somewhat overshadowed by the controversy surrounding that proposal.</p><p>Noy's legal and political career was not without controversy. He was known for his aggressive and uncompromising stance on issues, especially when it came to religious dissenters. This irked many of his opponents and drew criticism, with some even accusing him of pursuing his own agenda. His proposal of the ship money tax was a testament to his uncompromising nature and his unwavering loyalty to the monarch. </p><p>Despite the controversy, Noy's contributions to legal scholarship have not gone unnoticed. His works on the study of medieval English finance are still considered some of the most important in the field. He was also instrumental in reviving the Court of Exchequer, which had been dormant for some time. His legal opinions were highly respected and were often cited in court proceedings. </p><p>Apart from his legal and political career, little is known about Noy's personal life. He was married twice, but both of his wives died early. He had no children, and his estate was inherited by his younger brother. Noy's death was marked with little fanfare, and he was quickly forgotten by many. However, his contributions to the field of law live on, and his works continue to be studied and appreciated by legal scholars today.</p><p>Noy's proposal of the ship money tax had a significant impact on English history. The controversy surrounding the tax contributed to the tensions between the monarch and Parliament, which eventually led to the English Civil War. The tax was seen as an attack on individuals' rights and liberties, and it became a rallying cry for those who opposed the authoritarian rule of Charles I.</p><p>Despite the controversy, Noy's legal and political career was marked by significant achievements. He was deeply committed to the law and was a staunch defender of the English legal system. His writings on legal and financial issues were highly influential, and he played a key role in the development of English law during the early seventeenth century.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions, Noy was posthumously honoured with a public monument in Exeter Cathedral. The monument depicts him in his Attorney General's robes, holding a book and a legal writ. It serves as a reminder of his enduring legacy as a legal scholar and political figure.</p><p></p><p>
