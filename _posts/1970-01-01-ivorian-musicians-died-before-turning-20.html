He was born on April 5, 1915, in the city of Man in the west-central part of the country. Doudou's career as a journalist started at an early age, and it eventually led him to become the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, "Le Patriote."</p><p>During the French colonial era, Doudou was imprisoned by the colonial authorities for his nationalistic activities. After Ivory Coast gained independence in 1960, he quickly rose to prominence as a member of the government, where he held several ministerial positions. As a writer, he authored several books, including two novels, "Les Garçons en Blanc" (The Boys in White) and "Noces de Sable" (Sand Wedding).</p><p>Doudou was also a prominent political figure in the country's first multiparty elections, which ended the one-party rule of the Ivory Coast Democratic Party in 1990. He was part of the opposition party and was elected to the National Assembly, where he is remembered for his contribution to the drafting of the Ivorian Constitution. He passed away on September 19, 2002, at the age of 87.</p><p>Doudou was a staunch advocate for democracy, human rights, and African unity. During his tenure as a minister, he initiated several policies that aimed at improving the welfare of the Ivorian people, particularly in the areas of health, education, and agriculture. He was also a strong proponent of the Pan-African movement and worked tirelessly towards the unity of the continent. Doudou's contribution to Ivorian literature and journalism earned him several accolades, including the Order of the Ivorian Merit, one of the country's highest honors. His legacy lives on as one of the founding fathers of Ivorian democracy and a champion of African freedom and dignity.</p><p></p><p>
