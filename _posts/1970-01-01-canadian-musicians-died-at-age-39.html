Vézina was known for his skill, athleticism, and agility in the net, and he developed a unique style of goaltending that emphasized body positioning and precise movements.</p><p>After his playing career, Vézina became the coach of the Canadiens for the 1925-26 season, but his health began to decline, and he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He died later that year at the age of 39. In his memory, the NHL created the Vézina Trophy, awarded annually to the league's best goaltender. Many hockey historians consider Vézina to be one of the greatest goaltenders of all time, and he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1945.</p><p>Georges Vézina was born in Chicoutimi, Quebec, Canada, to a large family of twelve children. He began playing ice hockey at a young age and started his professional career with the Chicoutimi Hockey Club. In 1910, he was recruited by the Montreal Canadiens to play for their team, where he quickly established himself as one of the best goaltenders in the league.</p><p>During his tenure with the Canadiens, Vézina helped the team win the Stanley Cup twice and was also named to the NHL's First All-Star Team three times. He was admired for his ability to read the game, anticipate the shooter's moves and make acrobatic saves. He was also known for his calm demeanor and leadership skills, which helped him guide his team effectively.</p><p>Vézina's legacy lives on through the Vézina Trophy, which has been awarded to the league's best goaltender since 1927. The Canadiens also retired his jersey, number 1, and a statue of Vézina was erected outside the team's home arena, the Bell Centre, in Montreal.</p><p>In addition to his success on the ice, Vézina was highly respected off the ice as well. He was known for his hard work, dedication, and modesty, and he was regarded as a role model for young players.</p><p>Despite his short life and career, Georges Vézina's impact on ice hockey is immeasurable. His skill and influence on the goaltending position continue to be felt more than a century after he first stepped onto the ice.</p><p>Georges Vézina was married to Stella Blouin, and they had three children together. His oldest son, Marcel, went on to have a successful NHL career and was a member of the Canadiens' 1946 Stanley Cup-winning team. Vézina's younger brother, Pierre, also played professional ice hockey, and the two played together briefly on the Canadiens before Pierre's career was cut short due to injury.</p><p>Off the ice, Vézina was known for his philanthropy and generosity. He often donated money to local charities and was known to visit sick children in the hospital. After his death, a memorial fund was established in his name to support tuberculosis research and treatment.</p><p>Throughout his career, Vézina faced numerous challenges and setbacks, including multiple injuries and illnesses. Despite these obstacles, he remained committed to the game he loved and continued to perform at the highest level. His determination and perseverance continue to inspire young athletes today.</p><p></p><p>

(August 5, 1877		Claremont-July 8, 1917			Canoe Lake)


was
a Canadian
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He was a leading pioneer of the Canadian art movement known as the Group of Seven. Thomson is recognized for his distinctive style and use of bold, vivid colours in his landscape paintings. He was also known for his love of the outdoors and spent much of his time exploring the rugged wilderness of Canada. Despite his short career, Thomson's impact on Canadian art was significant and he remains one of Canada's most celebrated artists. Though his death remains a mystery, his legacy continues to inspire Canadian artists and nature lovers alike.</p><p>Thomson began his career as a commercial artist but found little fulfillment in this work. He eventually quit his job and moved to Toronto where he worked as a graphic designer and began to hone his craft as a painter. Thomson's artistic style was heavily influenced by the rugged beauty of the Canadian wilderness, which he captured in his landscapes with a bold simplicity that emphasized color and form. He once wrote, "Surely the best way to paint...is to be as free from any preconceived scheme as possible."</p><p>In addition to his artistic pursuits, Thomson was an avid outdoorsman, spending much of his time fishing and camping in the remote regions of Ontario. It was during one of these trips that he disappeared under mysterious circumstances, leading to speculation about his cause of death. The discovery of his body several days later, floating in Canoe Lake, only added to the mystery surrounding his death.</p><p>Despite his short career, Thomson's impact on Canadian art was profound. His work helped establish a distinctly Canadian identity for landscape art and paved the way for the Group of Seven, a collective of Canadian artists who sought to capture the unique beauty of the Canadian landscape. Today, Thomson's work is widely recognized and celebrated, and his legacy continues to inspire artists around the world.</p><p>Several notable institutions have recognized Thomson's contributions to Canadian art. In 1919, two years after his death, the National Gallery of Canada acquired his painting The West Wind, which is now recognized as one of his most important works. The Art Gallery of Ontario, which holds the largest public collection of Thomson's work, has hosted several major exhibitions of his paintings. Additionally, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound, Ontario is named in his honor and features a collection of his works along with exhibits on his life and legacy.Thomson's influence extends beyond the art world as well. His love for the Canadian wilderness and his advocacy for conservation and land protection inspired future generations to appreciate and protect Canada's natural beauty. Today, many parks and wilderness areas across Canada hold special significance for Thomson fans, who come to see the landscapes that inspired his paintings.Thomson's death remains shrouded in mystery and has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and even songs. Some have speculated that he was murdered, while others believe his death was accidental. Whatever the cause, his passing was a tragedy for the Canadian art community, and a loss that still resonates to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(January 10, 1607		Orléans-October 18, 1646			Auriesville)


was
a Canadian
personality.


					</p><p>Isaac Jogues was a French Jesuit missionary who traveled to New France in order to convert the indigenous peoples to Christianity. He is known for his work among the Huron and the Mohawk tribes. Despite initial success in his mission work, he was captured by the Mohawk in 1642 and subjected to torture and mutilation. He was later released and returned to France, but he felt called to continue his work among the Native Americans. He made a second voyage to New France in 1646, where he was martyred by a group of Mohawk warriors. He was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1930.</p><p>Isaac Jogues was born in Orleans, France to a wealthy family. He left home at the age of 17 to enter the Jesuit novitiate in Rouen, where he spent 10 years studying and working. In 1636, he was sent to New France (present-day Quebec) as a missionary.</p><p>Jogues quickly distinguished himself as a skilled linguist, learning the Huron language and beginning to evangelize the Huron people. He also traveled to the Mohawk territory to begin outreach to the Mohawk people.</p><p>However, in 1642, Jogues and his companions were captured by a band of Mohawk warriors. He was beaten, mutilated, and forced to run a gauntlet between two lines of warriors. Despite his ordeal, he remained steadfast in his faith and continued to minister to his fellow captives.</p><p>After nearly a year of captivity, Jogues was able to escape with the help of Dutch traders and return to France. He was hailed as a hero and a martyr, but he felt called to return to North America to continue his work.</p><p>In 1646, Jogues returned to New France, but he was captured again by the Mohawk. This time, he was martyred together with his fellow Jesuit, Jean de Lalande. Their deaths are celebrated by the Catholic Church on October 19th.</p><p>Isaac Jogues was canonized as a saint by Pope Pius XI in 1930, along with seven other North American martyrs. He is remembered for his courage, his commitment to evangelization, and his love for the indigenous peoples of Canada.</p><p>Isaac Jogues had a significant impact on the Jesuit missions in North America. His work among the Huron and Mohawk tribes helped to establish a strong Jesuit presence in the region. He played a key role in negotiating peace between warring tribes, and his efforts to build relationships with Mohawk leaders laid the foundation for future mission work.</p><p>Jogues was also a prolific writer, and his letters and reports provided important insights into the culture and customs of the indigenous peoples he worked with. His writings were later compiled into a book, "The Jesuit Relations", which is today regarded as a valuable historical document.</p><p>In addition to his missionary work, Jogues also made significant contributions to the fields of cartography and geography. He was one of the first Europeans to explore the Adirondack region of New York, and he created detailed maps of the area.</p><p>Today, Saint Isaac Jogues is remembered for his bravery, his selflessness, and his dedication to the service of others. His legacy continues to inspire people around the world to follow in his footsteps and work towards a better future for all humanity.</p><p></p><p>
