He first started racing go-karts at the age of 14, and progressed quickly to single-seater cars. After gaining experience in lower formulae, he made his Formula One debut for McLaren in 1980. Prost's defining characteristic was his smooth and efficient driving style, which earned him the nickname "The Professor". He retired from Formula One at the end of the 1993 season, but continued to race in other series until 1999. After his retirement, he worked as an advisor and ambassador for various teams and organizations in motorsport, and was involved in the creation of the Renault e.dams Formula E team.</p><p>Throughout his successful Formula One career, Alain Prost became known for his intense rivalry with Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna.

They raced against each other numerous times and had a fierce competition for the top spot. Prost also had notable stints with Renault, Ferrari, and Williams teams during his career. In 2010, Prost was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame for his outstanding career achievements. Throughout his career, he developed a reputation as a skilled strategist and technical driver, leading to successful campaigns in several endurance races including the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Prost's achievements and impact on the sport of motor racing have cemented his place as one of the greatest drivers of all time.</p><p>Apart from his successful career in Formula One, Prost also had a strong presence in the French Touring Car Championship, where he won the championship twice. He also won the World Sportscar Championship in 1998, driving for Toyota.

After his retirement from racing, he founded his own team, Prost Grand Prix, which competed in Formula One from 1997 to 2001. The team struggled to achieve success and Prost eventually sold it to a consortium led by his former teammate, Eddie Irvine. Despite this setback, Prost remained active in the sport and continued to champion advancements in safety and environmental sustainability. In recognition of his contributions to motorsport, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2000 and a Commander of the French Legion of Honour in 2012.
