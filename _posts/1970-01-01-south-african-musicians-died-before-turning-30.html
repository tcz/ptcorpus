After resigning as Minister of Justice, Kruger continued to serve in various government positions until his retirement in 1984. He died three years later.</p><p>During his time as a politician, Jimmy Kruger was known for his controversial statements, such as famously declaring that there was no such thing as a political detainee in South Africa. He was also criticized for his support of the government's use of torture and other brutal tactics against anti-apartheid activists. Kruger's reputation and legacy were further tarnished by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings held in the 1990s, which exposed many abuses committed by the apartheid regime, including some that Kruger had been directly involved in. Despite this, some supporters continue to defend Kruger's actions and argue that he was simply carrying out the policies of the government he served.</p><p>Kruger's infamous involvement in Steve Biko's death and his defense of the security forces' actions during apartheid earned him the nickname "Dr. Death" among his opponents. Following Biko's death, Kruger reportedly told a journalist that he "did not have the slightest intention of wasting my time listening to what [the international community] or anyone else for that matter has to say about it."</p><p>In addition to his role as Minister of Justice, Kruger also served as the Minister of Police and Prisons, where he oversaw the country's notoriously brutal prison system. During his time in this position, he defended the use of torture and other forms of abuse against inmates, stating that "some people need a bit of a hiding."</p><p>Kruger's legacy remains controversial in post-apartheid South Africa, with many continuing to criticize his actions and defend his victims. The Jimmy Kruger National Park, which was named after him during apartheid, was later renamed to the Addo Elephant National Park.</p><p></p><p>
