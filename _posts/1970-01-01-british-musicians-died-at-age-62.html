(April 26, 1889		Vienna-April 29, 1951			Cambridge)

	
		also known as Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein or Ludwig &quot;Lucki&quot; Wittgenstein

	
was
a British
philosopher, architect and teacher.


					</p><p>Wittgenstein is regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. He is known for his two major works, "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" and "Philosophical Investigations", which revolutionized the field of philosophy. Wittgenstein was interested in language, logic, and the limits of human understanding, and his work had a profound impact on many fields, including linguistics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive psychology. In addition to his philosophical contributions, Wittgenstein also worked as an architect and was known for his innovative designs. Wittgenstein was a complex and enigmatic figure, and his ideas continue to be studied and debated today.</p><p>Wittgenstein was born into one of the wealthiest families in Austria and was the youngest of eight children. He grew up in a multilingual household and was proficient in several languages from a young age. Wittgenstein studied engineering in Berlin, but quickly moved on to philosophy, studying with some of the most prominent philosophers of his time, including Bertrand Russell.</p><p>During World War I, Wittgenstein served as a soldier in the Austrian army, and his experiences had a profound impact on his philosophy. After the war, he returned to his studies and published his first major work, "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus", which attempted to establish a logical foundation for all knowledge.</p><p>After several years of teaching in Austria, Wittgenstein moved to Cambridge, England, where he became a professor of philosophy. He continued to develop his ideas and wrote his second major work, "Philosophical Investigations", which expanded on his earlier work and focused on the nature of language and its relationship to thought.</p><p>Wittgenstein was known for his unconventional teaching methods and remarkable intellect, but was also a very private person who struggled with depression and loneliness throughout his life. He remained unmarried and had few close relationships outside of his work.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Wittgenstein was always more interested in questions than answers, and his work remains open to interpretation and debate. He is remembered as one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century, and his ideas continue to influence and inspire scholars and thinkers around the world.</p><p>Wittgenstein's legacy also includes his contributions to the field of logic and the philosophy of mathematics. He believed that logic was the key to understanding the structure of the world and that mathematical statements were essentially logical statements. He also argued that many philosophical problems were the result of misunderstandings about the nature of language and that these problems could be solved by examining the way language was used in different contexts.</p><p>In addition to his philosophical and architectural pursuits, Wittgenstein also had a passion for music. He played several instruments and composed music throughout his life. He was particularly interested in the work of composer Arnold Schoenberg and was a strong advocate for his atonal music.</p><p>Wittgenstein's impact on philosophy has been far-reaching, with his work influencing many different schools of thought, including logical positivism, ordinary language philosophy, and postmodernism. His ideas have also had a significant impact outside the fields of philosophy and architecture, with his work inspiring advancements in fields such as computer science and linguistics.</p><p>Overall, Wittgenstein's life and work serve as a testament to the power of questioning and the importance of continually exploring new ideas and perspectives. Despite his tragically short life, his legacy continues to inspire and challenge scholars and thinkers today.</p><p></p><p>

(March 24, 1834		Walthamstow-October 3, 1896			London)

	
		a.k.a. W. Morris

	
was
a British
graphic designer, architect, novelist, writer, designer, artist and visual artist.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		May Morris.

						</p><p>Morris was one of the most important figures of the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain, which sought to revive traditional craftsmanship and to oppose the mass production of goods. He established Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., which later became Morris & Co., a company that produced textiles, wallpapers, and furniture using traditional techniques and high-quality materials. He also designed stained-glass windows, book covers, and typefaces. Morris was an ardent socialist and political activist, and he founded the Socialist League in 1884. He wrote several novels, including "A Dream of John Ball" and "News from Nowhere," which express his socialist ideals. Today, Morris is remembered as one of the most influential cultural figures of the Victorian era.</p><p>In addition to his work in the Arts and Crafts Movement, William Morris was also known for his poetry. He wrote several collections of poems, including "The Defence of Guenevere and Other Poems," which was published in 1858. Morris was heavily influenced by medieval literature and architecture, and this is reflected in his designs and writings. He was also a conservationist and was concerned about the environmental impact of industrialization. In his personal life, Morris was married to Jane Burden, a model and artist's muse, who was also involved in the Arts and Crafts Movement. Morris was a prolific artist and designer, and his work continues to be admired for its beauty and craftsmanship.</p><p>Morris was born in Walthamstow, England and was the third of nine children. His father was a successful broker and Morris attended Oxford University's Exeter College, where he studied Classics and made lifelong friends with artist Edward Burne-Jones. After graduation, he apprenticed with Gothic revival architect G.E. Street before founding the decorative arts company Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. with Burne-Jones and other artists.</p><p>In addition to his work as a craftsman, Morris was a prolific writer and poet. He published a number of essays on art and design, including "The Beauty of Life" and "Hopes and Fears for Art." Morris's socialist beliefs—and his frustration with the rapid industrialization of Britain—prompted him to join the Social Democratic Federation in 1883 and found the Socialist League the following year. He also ran for parliament twice as a Socialist candidate.</p><p>Morris's influence can be seen in the work of countless artists and designers that followed him, including those of the Arts and Crafts Movement, Art Nouveau, and even the Bauhaus. Today, his Morris & Co. designs continue to be popular, and the company still produces fabrics, wallpaper, and other decorative items. His legacy also lives on in the William Morris Gallery in Walthamstow, which preserves his life and work.</p><p></p><p>

(June 5, 1883		Cambridge-April 21, 1946			East Sussex)

	
		also known as John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes

	
was
a British
economist, politician and investor.


					</p><p>Keynes is widely regarded as one of the most influential economists of the 20th century. He is best known for his theory of Keynesian economics which argued that government intervention is necessary to stabilize the economy during periods of economic downturn. This theory helped shape economic policy in many countries following the Great Depression.</p><p>Keynes was also a successful investor, famously making a fortune in the stock market in the 1920s. He was a member of the famed Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals and counted writers like Virginia Woolf and Lytton Strachey among his close friends.</p><p>During World War I, Keynes worked for the British government as part of the Treasury Department, helping to finance the war effort. After the war, he was a key player in the negotiations leading up to the Treaty of Versailles, which he believed was too harsh on Germany and would lead to future conflict.</p><p>In addition to his economic work, Keynes was also a prolific writer and essayist. His most famous works include "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" and "Essays in Persuasion."</p><p>Keynes's economic theories have had a lasting impact on modern macroeconomic thought, particularly in the areas of government intervention and the role of aggregate demand in maintaining economic stability. In fact, his ideas were so influential that the post-World War II economic system was widely referred to as the "Keynesian Consensus."Apart from his professional achievements, Keynes was also a prominent member of society. He was a patron of the arts and played an active role in promoting national and international cultural projects. He was also known for his love of music and owned a large collection of rare manuscripts and scores. Keynes was married to the ballerina Lydia Lopokova and the couple had no children.</p><p>After the publication of his groundbreaking book, "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money," Keynes became known as one of the leading intellectuals of his time. He was also a prominent figure in British politics and played a key role in the establishment of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. In fact, it was largely due to Keynes's efforts that the Bretton Woods Conference was held in 1944, which resulted in the creation of the IMF and the World Bank.</p><p>In addition to his work in economics and politics, Keynes was also a devoted collector of art and antiquities. He was particularly interested in the Bloomsbury Group's Omega Workshops, an avant-garde design collective that specialized in furniture, textiles, and other decorative arts. Keynes acquired a number of Omega pieces over the years and was also an active patron of other artists and designers.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Keynes was not without controversy. He was often criticized for his unorthodox economic theories and his belief in deficit spending as a means of stimulating economic growth. He was also accused of being too sympathetic to the Soviet Union and other socialist regimes.</p><p>Despite these criticisms, Keynes's influence on modern economics cannot be overstated. His theories have formed the basis of modern macroeconomic thought and have had a tremendous impact on economic policy in countries around the world. Today, Keynes's legacy continues to inspire a new generation of economists and policymakers alike.</p><p></p><p>

(November 8, 1723		Newstead Abbey-April 10, 1786			London)


was
a British
personality.


					</p><p>He was a naval officer and a poet known for his satirical and irreverent writings. Byron was the grandfather of the famous poet Lord Byron and is sometimes referred to as "Foul-weather Jack" due to his reputation for sailing in difficult conditions. He is also remembered for his navigational skills and accomplishments, including being the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe twice. Despite his successes, Byron's personal life was tumultuous and he struggled with alcoholism and financial difficulties throughout his career. Nonetheless, he remains an important figure in British naval history and his legacy continues to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>After completing his education, John Byron joined the Royal Navy in 1740 and served throughout the War of Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War. He had a successful naval career, rising through the ranks and eventually being appointed as the Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland in 1764. During his time in Newfoundland, he worked to improve the living conditions of the local population and created a set of laws that are considered to be the foundation of the region's legal system. </p><p>Byron's literary works include several poems and one play, many of which were inspired by his travels and experiences at sea. His most famous poem, "The Isles of Greece," was written following his visit to the Mediterranean in 1751, and is considered to be a precursor to Lord Byron's later work on Greek liberation. </p><p>Unfortunately, Byron's personal life was often turbulent. He was married twice, both times to wealthy heiresses, but his financial difficulties and infidelity strained both marriages. His alcoholism also caused him considerable health problems and eventually contributed to his dismissal from his Governorship of Newfoundland. However, despite these challenges, John Byron is remembered as one of the most important sailors and writers of his time, and his legacy continues to be celebrated by scholars and admirers around the world.</p><p>In addition to his naval and literary accomplishments, John Byron was also an avid explorer. In 1764, he set out on an expedition to find the Southern Continent, which was believed to exist somewhere in the South Pacific. Although he did not find the continent, he did make significant discoveries, including discovering the island now known as Ducie Island. Byron's explorations paved the way for future explorers, and his journals and maps were used by cartographers for years to come. He was also known for his bravery and resilience in the face of adversity. During his travels, he survived multiple shipwrecks and narrowly avoided death on several occasions. Despite his difficult personal life, John Byron remains an inspirational figure in British history, admired for his achievements both on land and at sea.</p><p></p><p>

was
a British
engineer and inventor.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Francis Trevithick.

						</p><p>Trevithick is best known for his contributions to steam engine technology. He built the first high-pressure steam engine in 1799 and later developed the first full-scale working railway steam locomotive in 1804, which he called the “Penydarren.” Trevithick’s innovations helped to transform transportation and industry, vastly improving productivity and efficiency. He also worked on various other engineering projects, including the design of an early submarine prototype. Trevithick’s legacy continues to be felt today, as his innovations paved the way for the Industrial Revolution and the modern world.</p><p>Trevithick's interest in engineering started at an early age. By age 19, he had designed and built his first steam engine. His invention of the high-pressure steam engine in 1799 was groundbreaking, as it allowed for greater efficiency and more powerful engines. In addition to his work on steam engines, Trevithick also had a keen interest in the potential of steam-powered vehicles. He built several steam-powered cars and buses, but they were not commercially successful due to technical problems.</p><p>Trevithick faced many challenges in his career, including financial difficulties and disputes with other inventors over patents. Despite these setbacks, he continued to innovate and push the boundaries of technological advancement. His legacy also includes the development of Cornish boiler, a type of steam boiler widely used in industry.</p><p>Trevithick died in 1833, but his contributions to steam engine technology and transportation live on. He is remembered as a pioneer in the field of engineering and an important figure in the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Throughout his career, Trevithick was known for his determination and willingness to take risks with new inventions. He was often willing to test his designs himself and put himself in danger to prove that they worked. In one famous incident, he drove his steam carriage up the steep hill of Beacon Hill in Camborne, Cornwall, in front of a large crowd. The carriage made it up the hill, but then crashed on the way down, injuring Trevithick and his passengers. Despite this setback, Trevithick continued to work on steam-powered vehicles and even proposed the idea of a steam-powered submarine to the British Navy.</p><p>Trevithick's legacy has been honored in many ways, including a statue in his hometown of Camborne and the naming of a street after him in London. He is also featured on the British £2 coin, which commemorates the 200th anniversary of the first steam locomotive. Today, his innovations and contributions to engineering continue to be studied and celebrated, inspiring future generations of inventors and engineers.</p><p></p><p>
