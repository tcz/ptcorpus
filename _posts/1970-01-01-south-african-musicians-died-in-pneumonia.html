					</p><p>Phillips was a prominent figure in the South African music scene during the 1980s and 1990s. He began his career as a member of the punk rock band Corporal Punishment, before going on to form numerous other bands including Cherry Faced Lurchers and his solo project, Bernoldus Niemand. </p><p>Phillips' music often spoke to the political and social climate of South Africa during apartheid, and he was known for his powerful lyrics and distinctive voice. He collaborated with many other notable South African musicians, and was a key player in the alternative music scene that emerged during the 1980s. </p><p>Tragically, Phillips passed away at the age of 36 due to complications from a stroke. Despite his short career, he left a lasting impact on the South African music landscape and is remembered as a pioneering figure in the country's rock and roll history.</p><p>Phillips was born in Springs, a town located east of Johannesburg, South Africa. He spent most of his childhood in this town, which he often referenced in his music. In the late 1970s, Phillips moved to Johannesburg to pursue a career in music. He became involved in the punk rock scene and formed his first band, Corporal Punishment. Despite limited commercial success, the band gained a cult following in South Africa.</p><p>Phillips went on to form several other bands throughout his career, including The Cherry Faced Lurchers and The Illegal Gathering. In 1984, he released his first solo album under the pseudonym Bernoldus Niemand. The album, Wie Is Bernoldus Niemand?, included the hit single "Hou my vas korporaal" ("Hold me tight, corporal"), which became an anthem for the anti-apartheid movement.</p><p>Phillips continued to produce politically charged music in the years leading up to the fall of apartheid. In 1993, he released his final studio album, Footprints in the Sand. The album was a departure from his earlier work and showcased a more introspective and contemplative side of Phillips' writing.</p><p>Aside from his music, Phillips was known for his sharp wit and irreverent personality. He was a popular figure among his peers and collaborated with many notable South African musicians including Vusi Mahlasela and Karen Zoid.</p><p>Phillips' death in 1995 was a shock to the South African music community. He was widely mourned and his music continues to be celebrated to this day. In 2018, a documentary film about Phillips' life and legacy, called "The Fun's Not Over," was released.</p><p></p><p>
