(November 11, 1930		Washington, D.C.-July 19, 1982			McLean)


was
an American
physicist and mathematician.


					
			
		His child
		is
		
		Mark Oliver Everett.

						</p><p>Everett is most famous for his theory of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, proposed in his 1957 doctoral thesis at Princeton University. This interpretation posits that the universe constantly branches into parallel worlds for every possible outcome of a quantum event, rather than the more familiar Copenhagen interpretation which suggests that the outcome is determined only when it is measured. </p><p>Following the defense of his thesis, Everett left academia and worked for the U.S. government as a defense analyst and consultant. He also pursued interests in fields such as music and poker, and had a reputation as a charismatic and independent thinker. </p><p>Although his many-worlds interpretation was initially met with skepticism and even hostility, it has gradually gained acceptance and become an influential perspective in quantum mechanics. Everett himself did not live to see its widespread acceptance, as he died at the age of 51.</p><p>Everett's many-worlds interpretation has had a significant impact not just on the field of quantum mechanics, but also on science fiction and popular culture. It has been the subject of numerous books, movies, and TV shows, and has influenced the work of writers such as Philip K. Dick and Robert A. Heinlein. In addition to his contributions to physics, Everett was also a talented musician and performed in a number of bands, including the Washington D.C.-based psychedelic rock group, The Eels. He was also a skilled poker player, and at one point even considered pursuing a career as a professional gambler. Despite his many interests outside of physics, Everett's work has had a lasting impact on the field, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important and innovative thinkers in twentieth-century physics.</p><p>After leaving academia, Everett worked for two years at the Pentagon as a member of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG), and later as a consultant for the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). It is said that Everett's mathematical talent, combined with his skepticism of military authority, made him a valuable asset to the government, but also led to some tension between him and his superiors.</p><p>In his personal life, Everett was married twice, first to Nancy Gore, and later to Gretchen, with whom he had his son, Mark. Mark Everett later achieved fame as the lead singer and songwriter for the band Eels.</p><p>Despite the initial skepticism his many-worlds interpretation faced, it has since become widely accepted, with many physicists viewing it as a viable alternative to the Copenhagen interpretation. It has also been the subject of ongoing debate and discussion among scientists and philosophers.</p><p>Hugh Everett's contributions to quantum mechanics laid the foundation for many future discoveries and innovations in the field. He is remembered as a brilliant and unconventional thinker whose work continues to inspire and intrigue scientists and non-scientists alike.</p><p>After his initial departure from academia, Everett rejoined it in the late 1960s, taking a position at the Irvine campus of the University of California. There, he continued to work on the many-worlds interpretation, as well as other topics in physics such as quantum field theory and general relativity. Although he did not publish many papers during this period, his influence on the field of quantum mechanics continued to grow, with a new generation of physicists inspired by his ideas.In addition to his contributions to physics, Everett was also known for his unconventional views on topics such as the nature of time and the role of consciousness in the universe. He believed that the many-worlds interpretation provided a framework for understanding these concepts in a way that was consistent with our current understanding of the universe. Despite his unusual ideas, Everett was respected by his colleagues for his brilliant mind and his willingness to question established theories.Hugh Everett III's legacy continues to be felt in the field of physics and beyond. His many-worlds interpretation has inspired generations of physicists, and his unconventional thinking has opened up new avenues of inquiry in fields such as philosophy and consciousness studies. He is remembered as a brilliant and innovative thinker who pushed the boundaries of what we can know about the universe.</p><p>In addition to his work in physics and his many interests outside the field, Hugh Everett III was also known for his struggles with alcoholism. He was a heavy drinker throughout much of his life and his addiction is believed to have contributed to his departure from academia and his relatively quiet later years. Despite this, however, Everett's contributions to science and his lasting impact on the field of quantum mechanics are his most enduring legacy. Today, his many-worlds interpretation is widely accepted as a viable alternative to the Copenhagen interpretation, and his work continues to inspire new generations of physicists and thinkers.</p><p></p><p>

(August 15, 1933		New York City-December 20, 1984			Manhattan)


was
an American
scientist, psychologist, professor and author.


					</p><p>Milgram is known for his controversial research on obedience to authority, conducted in the early 1960s at Yale University. In these experiments, participants were instructed to administer electric shocks to a stranger they believed to be another participant, with the shocks increasing in intensity with each incorrect response. Milgram found that a surprisingly high percentage of participants were willing to administer the highest level of shock, even when they believed it could cause serious harm to the other person. Milgram's research raised important ethical questions and remains widely discussed and debated in the field of psychology. In addition to his work on obedience, Milgram also conducted research on topics such as conformity, social influence, and the bystander effect. He authored several books, including "Obedience to Authority" and "The Individual in a Social World".</p><p>Milgram was married to artist Alexandra Milgram and had two children. He earned his Bachelor's degree in political science from Queens College before turning to psychology, which he studied at Harvard University under the tutelage of Solomon Asch. Besides academia, he briefly worked at the National Institute of Mental Health as well. Milgram was a pioneer in social psychology and his work continues to be studied and referenced to this day. He received numerous awards for his research, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Social and Behavioral Sciences Prize in 1966. Despite the controversy surrounding his obedience experiments, Milgram's contributions to the field of psychology continue to be recognized and studied by researchers and scholars around the world.</p><p>After the controversy surrounding his obedience experiments, Milgram shifted his focus towards exploring the concept of "six degrees of separation" and the idea that everyone is connected to each other through a chain of six people. This led to the development of the "small world" experiment, which tested this theory by having participants send letters to acquaintances with the goal of reaching a specific target individual. Milgram found that the letters usually passed through six or fewer intermediaries before reaching the target, providing evidence for the concept of six degrees of separation.</p><p>In addition to his research, Milgram was also a beloved professor at the City University of New York, where he taught for many years. His passion for his work, as well as his engaging teaching style, inspired many of his students to pursue careers in psychology and social sciences.</p><p>Milgram's work on obedience and other topics continues to be influential in psychology and social psychology. His research is often cited as evidence for the power of social influence and the importance of individual responsibility in the face of authority. Despite his untimely death, Milgram's contributions to the field of psychology have had a lasting impact and continue to be studied and debated by scholars and researchers around the world.</p><p>Milgram's findings about obedience to authority were controversial and led to criticism from some in the scientific community. Critics argued that the experiments were unethical and caused psychological harm to the participants. Milgram defended his research, arguing that the importance of the knowledge gained outweighed any potential harm caused to the participants.</p><p>In addition to his work in psychology, Milgram was also an advocate for social justice and civil rights. He participated in protests against the Vietnam War and was involved in efforts to desegregate neighborhoods in New York City.</p><p>Today, Milgram is remembered as a pioneering researcher who pushed the boundaries of traditional social psychology. His work on obedience to authority and the concept of six degrees of separation continues to influence both academic research and popular culture.</p><p>Milgram's legacy has also influenced fields beyond psychology, such as law enforcement, political science, and business. His research on obedience to authority has been studied and utilized in developing training programs for police and military personnel. His findings on the importance of individual responsibility have also been applied in the corporate world, with some companies adapting their organizational structures and training programs to encourage ethical decision-making and accountability. </p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding his research, Milgram remains a significant figure in the history of psychology, with his work continuing to inspire new research and discussions in the field. His insights into human behavior and social dynamics continue to have relevance and impact in today's society, making him a lasting influence on the study of psychology and social sciences.</p><p></p><p>
