(April 5, 1482		Guémar-June 19, 1542			Zürich)


was
a Swiss
personality.


					</p><p>He was a Protestant reformer and theologian who played a significant role in the Swiss Reformation. Jud studied under Huldrych Zwingli at the University of Basel and later became his colleague in Zurich. He was known for his skills as a linguist and was instrumental in translating the Bible into German. Jud also served as a pastor in Zurich and was a close friend and advisor to Zwingli. He was known for his moderate stance in theological debates and for his efforts to promote unity among the various Protestant factions. Leo Jud was a pivotal figure in the early years of the Swiss Reformation and his contributions helped to shape the course of Protestantism in Switzerland and beyond.</p><p>Despite his numerous achievements, Leo Jud faced many challenges during his lifetime. He was forced to flee Zurich in 1526 after the city council ordered the expulsion of all Anabaptists and he was falsely accused of being one of them. He eventually returned to Zurich in 1530 and played a vital role in drafting the First Helvetic Confession, which became one of the foundational documents of the Reformed Church in Switzerland. Jud was also a prolific writer and his works include numerous treatises, sermons, and translations of theological works. In addition to his theological contributions, Jud was also known for his philanthropic work and his efforts to help the poor and needy. He died in Zurich in 1542 at the age of 60, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire and influence theologians and scholars to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(May 8, 1834-March 10, 1895)

	
		also known as Fritz Muller or Dr. Fritz Müller

	
was
a Swiss
physician.


					</p><p>However, he is primarily remembered for his pioneering work in the fields of evolutionary biology, botany, and zoology. Müller spent much of his life in Brazil, where he studied the natural history of the country and made many important discoveries. He is credited with contributing significantly to our understanding of mimicry in animals and the role it plays in evolution. He was also a keen observer of plant-pollinator interactions, and his work helped establish the importance of these interactions in the maintenance of biodiversity. Later in his life, Müller became involved in politics and was elected to the Brazilian National Assembly, where he fought for the rights of naturalized citizens. He was widely recognized for his contributions to science and was awarded numerous honors and awards, including the Darwin-Wallace Medal, which he received in 1908.</p><p>Müller was born in a small village called Wollerau, near Lake Zurich in Switzerland. As a child, he was fascinated by nature and spent much of his time exploring the forests and fields around his home. After completing his medical studies in Germany, he traveled to Brazil in 1852, where he worked as a physician in a German colony. In his free time, Müller explored the natural history of the region, collecting specimens and making observations.</p><p>One of Müller's most significant contributions to evolutionary biology was his work on mimicry in butterflies. He discovered that some species of butterflies evolved to resemble toxic or unpalatable species, allowing them to avoid being eaten by predators. This type of mimicry, known as Batesian mimicry, became an important area of study in evolutionary biology.</p><p>Müller also studied the pollination of flowers by insects and birds, and he discovered many new plant species in Brazil. In addition, he was an advocate for conservation and was concerned about the impact of deforestation and development on the natural world.</p><p>Müller was a prolific writer, and his scientific publications were widely read and respected. He also published several books on Brazil and its natural history. Today, he is considered one of the most important naturalists of the 19th century, and his work continues to inspire scientists and conservationists around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(June 1, 1886		Vienna-August 2, 1946			Bern)


was
a Swiss
personality.


					</p><p>Ernst Kurth was a renowned Swiss musicologist, composer and music theorist. Born in Vienna, Austria, he later moved to Switzerland where he spent most of his life studying, teaching and writing about music. He is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential musicologists of the 20th century.</p><p>Kurth's work focused on the analysis of music, exploring its structures, forms and meanings. He was interested in the relationship between music and language, and believed that music could be studied and interpreted in much the same way as poetry. His theories and methods continue to have a significant impact on musicology today.</p><p>In addition to his scholarly work, Kurth was also an accomplished composer, with a particular interest in vocal music. He wrote a number of works in a variety of genres, and his music is notable for its expressive power and lyricism.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Kurth's life was cut short by illness. He died in 1946 at the age of 60, leaving behind a legacy of scholarship and creative work that continues to be celebrated by musicians and scholars alike.</p><p>Kurth began his academic career studying philosophy and musicology at the University of Vienna, where he earned his PhD in 1913. He later became a professor of musicology at the University of Zurich, where he taught for over two decades. Kurth's most famous work, "Grundlagen des linearen Kontrapunkts" (Principles of Linear Counterpoint), was published in 1921 and is still considered a seminal work in the field of music theory. It provided a new way of thinking about the function of individual voices in a musical composition, and greatly influenced subsequent generations of music theorists.</p><p>Kurth was also an important figure in the Swiss musical establishment, serving as director of the Zurich Conservatory from 1929 until his death. During his tenure, he oversaw a significant expansion of the school's programs and facilities. In addition, he was a member of various musicological societies and served as the president of the International Society for Contemporary Music from 1937 to 1940.</p><p>Despite his academic and administrative responsibilities, Kurth remained dedicated to composition throughout his life. He wrote a variety of works in a range of styles, including songs, chamber music, and orchestral pieces. His most famous composition is "Cantata for the 80th Birthday of Alfred Escher," a work for choir and orchestra that celebrates the life of the Swiss industrialist and politician. </p><p>Kurth's work continues to be studied and debated by musicologists today. His ideas about the relationship between music and language, and his use of analytical techniques derived from linguistics, have been both praised and criticized. However, there is no doubt that his work has had a profound impact on the field of music theory, and that his legacy continues to inspire new generations of scholars and musicians.</p><p></p><p>
