						Louis Moreau Gottschalk was considered one of the most talented composers of his time who specialized in creating works inspired by Latin American dance rhythms. Born into a Jewish family in New Orleans, Louisiana, he displayed exceptional talent as a musician from a young age. He began his formal music education at the age of six and later traveled to Europe to study under celebrated pianists and composers. His unique style of blending European classical music with rhythms from Latin America and the Caribbean earned him recognition as one of the first classical composers to incorporate elements of a distinctly American style into his work. Despite his premature death at the age of 40, Louis Moreau Gottschalk continues to be celebrated for his extraordinary contributions to the development of American classical music.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=269839" title="Wikipedia article about Louis Moreau Gottschalk">Louis Moreau Gottschalk on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/new-zealand-musicians-died-at-age-53.html' title='New Zealand musicians died at age 53'><strong>New Zealand musicians died at age 53</strong> List of the top 12 New Zealand music stars who died when they were 53</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-actors-died-in-1979.html' title='Austrian actors died in 1979'><strong>Austrian actors died in 1979</strong> List of the top 3 Austrian actors who died in 1979</a></li><li><a href='/british-musicians-died-in-accidental-fall.html' title='British musicians died in Accidental fall'><strong>British musicians died in Accidental fall</strong> List of the top 1 British music stars who died in Accidental fall</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/venezuelan-musicians-died-at-age-27.html' title='Venezuelan musicians died at age 27'><strong>Venezuelan musicians died at age 27</strong> List of the top 2 Venezuelan music stars who died when they were 27</a></li><li><a href='/chinese-actors-died-at-age-44.html' title='Chinese actors died at age 44'><strong>Chinese actors died at age 44</strong> List of the top 2 Chinese actors who died when they were 44</a></li><li><a href='/belarusian-musicians-died-at-age-78.html' title='Belarusian musicians died at age 78'><strong>Belarusian musicians died at age 78</strong> List of the top 1 Belarusian music stars who died when they were 78</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
