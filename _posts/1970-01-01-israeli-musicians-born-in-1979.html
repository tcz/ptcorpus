(June 6, 1979		Lod-)

	
		a.k.a. Tammer Naffar

	
is
an Israeli
rapper, actor and screenwriter.


						</p><p>Nafar is the founder of the Palestinian hip-hop group DAM, which stands for "Da Arabian MCs." The group is known for their politically charged lyrics about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and for their promotion of Arab and Muslim culture. Nafar has also acted in several films, including "The Bubble" and "Junction 48," which he also co-wrote. He has been recognized for his contributions to the arts and activism, receiving the 2018 Edward Said National Conservatory of Music Award for Creativity and the Arts and being named one of the most influential Arabs under 40 by Arabian Business in 2015. In addition to his artistic endeavors, Nafar is an advocate for Palestinian rights and has spoken at various international events and rallies.</p><p>Furthermore, Tamer Nafar was born in a Palestinian family in Lod, Israel, and grew up in a densely populated Arab neighborhood. He spent several years studying and performing with his group DAM, which has become one of the most prominent hip hop acts in the Arab world. Nafar's work with DAM has been featured in numerous documentaries and news programs, bringing attention to the plight of the Palestinian people. He has also collaborated with a diverse group of artists, including Israeli rock band Mashina, American rapper Chuck D, and the London-based orchestra ICYMI. In addition to his music and acting career, Nafar is actively involved in community programs that help empower Arab and Palestinian youth. He has established several cultural centers in his hometown of Lod, providing a space for young people to express themselves through art and music. Despite facing backlash and criticism for his outspoken activism and views, Tamer Nafar remains committed to promoting social change and inspiring a new generation of artists and activists.</p><p>Nafar's involvement in political and social issues is not limited to his advocacy work for Palestinian rights. He has also spoken out about issues of discrimination and inequality facing Arab and Muslim communities in Israel, and has used his platform to raise awareness about these issues. Nafar has been a vocal critic of the Israeli government's policies towards Palestinians and Arab citizens of Israel, and has called for greater equality and justice for all people living in the region.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to the arts and activism, Nafar is also a father of three and has spoken about the challenges of balancing fatherhood with his busy career. Despite these challenges, he remains committed to using his platform to promote positive change and inspire others to do the same. His work has been recognized both in Israel and internationally, and he continues to be a prominent figure in the world of Palestinian and Arab culture.</p><p>Nafar's music and activism have not come without controversy. In 2017, he and his group DAM were banned from performing at a music festival in Spain due to pressure from the Israeli government. Nafar responded to the ban by saying, "They can stop us from performing in Spain, but they cannot stop the message from spreading." He has also faced backlash from right-wing Israelis who view his activism as anti-Semitic and unpatriotic.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Nafar is dedicated to creating a world where all people are treated with equality and respect. He continues to use his platform to speak out against injustice and to advocate for a better future for Palestinians and all marginalized communities. In an interview with The Guardian, Nafar stated, "I believe that music is a powerful tool for change. It can inspire people to think differently and to take action. That's why I will continue to make music and speak out, no matter what challenges come my way."</p><p></p><p>
