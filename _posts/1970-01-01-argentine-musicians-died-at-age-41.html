(April 5, 2015-April 5, 1974)


was
an Argentine
personality.


					</p><p>Humberto Viola was an Argentine Army General who served as the de facto President of Argentina between 29 March and 11 December 1981, during the National Reorganization Process military dictatorship in Argentina. He held several important positions in the military government, including Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Army. After the end of the dictatorship in 1983, he was charged with crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the Dirty War, a period of state terrorism in which thousands of political opponents were killed or "disappeared" by the military regime. He died in prison in 1994.</p><p>Born in Córdoba, Viola was educated at the National Military College in Buenos Aires and the United States Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He served as a military attaché in Washington, D.C. during the 1960s and was involved in several counter-insurgency operations in Argentina, including the 1967 Corrientes Province massacre, before rising through the ranks of the army.</p><p>As part of the military junta that seized power in 1976, Viola played a prominent role in the repression of political dissidents, trade unionists, and left-wing guerrillas. He was appointed as commander-in-chief of the army in 1978 and oversaw the planning of the invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982, which ultimately failed.</p><p>Viola was known for his authoritarian and conservative views, which he expressed during his brief tenure as president. He implemented a series of economic reforms aimed at reducing inflation and promoting foreign investment, but also continued the military government's policy of repression, with thousands of people being detained, tortured, and "disappeared" under his watch.</p><p>After being sentenced to life imprisonment in 1985, Viola spent the rest of his life in prison. Despite his conviction, he remained a controversial figure in Argentina, with some seeing him as a hero who had defended the country against left-wing terrorism, while others saw him as a symbol of the brutality and impunity of the military regime.</p><p>During his time in power, Viola also faced criticism from some members of the military establishment for what they saw as his hesitancy and lack of leadership. This led to his eventual ousting in December 1981, when he was replaced by Lieutenant General Leopoldo Galtieri. </p><p>Viola's legacy continues to be controversial in Argentina today. While some admire his defense of the country against left-wing terrorism during the Dirty War, others criticize him for his role in the military regime's brutal tactics and lack of respect for human rights. His death in prison in 1994 was seen as the end of an era for many Argentines, but the debates over his life and legacy continue to this day.</p><p>Viola's role in the Argentine military dictatorship and the Dirty War has had a lasting impact on the country's political and social landscape. Despite his controversial legacy, his life and career offer important insights into the complex and often violent history of Argentina in the 20th century.</p><p>Viola's rise to power and subsequent downfall are emblematic of the tumultuous period in Argentine history. His authoritarian regime, characterized by brutal repression and economic instability, was a reflection of the military dictatorship's fear of dissent and opposition.</p><p>However, Viola's conviction for crimes against humanity and his imprisonment raised important questions about the role of military leaders in the post-dictatorship era. Some argued that the prosecution of Viola represented an important step towards accountability and justice, while others accused the government of engaging in a politically motivated campaign against former members of the military regime.</p><p>Despite these controversies, Viola's legacy remains an important facet of Argentine history, as the country continues to grapple with the legacy of the military dictatorship and its impact on society.</p><p>Additionally, Viola was also known for his involvement in the so-called "Dirty War" death flights, which involved prisoners being drugged and thrown from airplanes into the Rio de la Plata. He was also implicated in the murder of Argentine Bishop Enrique Angelelli, who spoke out against human rights abuses by the military government. Viola's role in the Dirty War and other crimes against humanity has led to accusations of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity, making him a highly controversial figure in Argentine history.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Viola remains an important figure in Argentina's history, serving as a reminder of the brutality and authoritarianism of the military dictatorship. His life and career continue to be studied and debated by historians, social scientists, and political analysts, as Argentina grapples with the legacy of its traumatic past and works to build a more just and democratic society.</p><p>Throughout his life, Humberto Viola was a figure of great controversy, with some regarding him as a defender of Argentina against left-wing terrorism while others saw him as a symbol of the military regime's brutality and lack of respect for human rights.
