		also known as Ricardo Rodriguez

	
was
a Mexican
race car driver.


					</p><p>He is best known for his success in sports car racing during the early 1960s, particularly as a member of the Ferrari factory team. Rodriguez began his racing career at an early age, competing in motocross before eventually transitioning to four-wheel racing. He made his professional debut in 1961 at the age of 19, driving for the Rob Walker Racing Team in the non-championship Mexican Grand Prix. In 1962, Rodriguez secured a full-time drive with Ferrari and proved to be a talented driver, consistently finishing in the points and earning his first podium finish at the Belgian Grand Prix. Tragically, he was killed in a crash during practice for the Mexican Grand Prix later that year, cutting short a promising career. Despite his brief time in the sport, Rodriguez remains a beloved figure in Mexican racing and is remembered as one of the country's greatest drivers.</p><p>In addition to his success in sports car racing, Rodriguez also had talent in other areas of motorsport, including Formula One and NASCAR. In fact, he became the youngest driver ever to compete in a Formula One race in 1961 when he drove in the Italian Grand Prix at the age of 19 years and 208 days. He also competed in several NASCAR races in the United States, including the Daytona 500 in 1962.</p><p>Off the track, Rodriguez had a reputation as a charming and friendly person who was well-liked by his fellow drivers and fans alike. He was known for his infectious smile and positive attitude, and was widely considered to be a future world champion in the making. Despite his tragic passing at such a young age, Rodriguez's legacy continues to live on in the hearts and minds of racing enthusiasts around the world.</p><p>Rodriguez came from a family of racers - his older brother Pedro was also a successful driver and competed in Formula One. They were known as the "Flying Rodriguez Brothers" and often raced together, including in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Ricardo's talent on the track was evident from a young age and he began racing go-karts when he was just eight years old. He quickly moved up the ranks and was soon competing in higher-level events. </p><p>In addition to his on-track success, Rodriguez was also a philanthropist and active in his community. He was involved in various charitable organizations and regularly donated money and time to help those in need. After his death, a foundation was established in his name to honor his memory and continue his charitable work. </p><p>Today, the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City - where Rodriguez tragically lost his life - is named in honor of him and his brother Pedro. The track has hosted numerous international events, including Formula One races, and remains an important part of Mexican motorsports history.</p><p>Despite his success in multiple forms of motorsport, Rodriguez is perhaps best known for his achievements in sports car racing. In 1962, he won the 1000 km Nürburgring alongside teammate and fellow Ferrari driver Phil Hill. The victory made Rodriguez the youngest winner of a World Sportscar Championship race at the time. He also won the 1962 Targa Florio alongside his brother Pedro, becoming the first Mexicans to win the prestigious Italian endurance race.</p><p>In addition to his racing accomplishments, Rodriguez was a skilled mechanic and often worked on his own cars. He was known for his attention to detail and technical expertise, which helped him gain an edge over his competitors on the track. </p><p>Rodriguez's untimely death at the age of 20 was a great loss to the racing community, but his legacy lives on through his impressive track record and the many lives he touched throughout his career.</p><p></p><p>
