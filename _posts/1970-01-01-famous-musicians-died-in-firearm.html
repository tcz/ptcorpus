(July 19, 1893		Baghdati-April 14, 1930			Moscow)

	
		a.k.a. Маяковский, Владимир Владимирович, Vladimir Majakovski, Vladimir Mayakovski, V. Mayakovsky or Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky

	
was
a Russian
playwright, poet, artist, actor, screenwriter and visual artist.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Yelena Vladimirovna Mayakovskaya.

						</p><p>Mayakovsky was one of the most prominent figures of the Russian Futurist movement and his poetry is known for its unique style and political engagement. He was deeply committed to the ideals of communism and wrote many works that supported the Soviet revolution. Mayakovsky's literary legacy also includes plays, essays, and screenplays for the Soviet film industry. His visual art, which includes propaganda posters, is also highly regarded. Mayakovsky's death by suicide in 1930 shocked the world and was seen as the tragic end of a brilliant, yet troubled, artist. Nevertheless, his contributions to Russian literature continue to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Mayakovsky was born in the Georgian village of Baghdati, which was then part of the Russian Empire. He had a difficult childhood as his father, an Imeretian forester, died when he was just 14 years old. Despite this, Mayakovsky showed an early talent for writing poetry and became involved in socialist activities while still in school.</p><p>In 1912, Mayakovsky moved to Moscow where he joined the Futurist movement and began to publish his work in avant-garde journals. He quickly gained a reputation for his innovative style, which combined modernist techniques with a strong sense of social and political engagement. His 1915 poem "A Cloud in Trousers" caused a scandal with its frank sexuality and condemnation of bourgeois society.</p><p>Mayakovsky remained an active supporter of the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution and worked for the Soviet government as a propagandist and cultural ambassador. His most famous works from this period include the play "The Bedbug" and the epic poem "The Cloud in Trousers."</p><p>Despite his success, Mayakovsky struggled with depression throughout his life and made several suicide attempts before finally succeeding in 1930. His death was mourned by many as a tragic loss to Russian culture and the Soviet state, and his work continues to be studied and admired around the world.</p><p>Mayakovsky's poetry was influenced by the Futurist movement, which advocated for avant-garde art and rejected traditional forms of art and literature. His work often featured themes of social justice, industrialization, and the struggle of the working class. He was also known for his use of language, which included slang and colloquialisms, as well as his striking visual imagery.</p><p>In addition to his literary and artistic achievements, Mayakovsky was also known for his public appearances and performances. He often recited his poetry in front of large audiences and was known for his theatrical delivery and charismatic personality. His physical appearance, with his tall stature and piercing gaze, also made him a recognizable figure in the avant-garde community.</p><p>Mayakovsky's influence on Russian literature and art cannot be overstated. His work inspired many poets and artists in the Soviet Union and beyond, and his legacy continues to be celebrated by scholars and enthusiasts around the world.</p><p>Mayakovsky was also known for his romantic and tumultuous relationship with fellow artist and actress Lilya Brik. The two became close after meeting in 1915 and their relationship inspired much of Mayakovsky's poetry. Some of his most famous love poems, including "You" and "About That," were written for Brik. Their relationship was complicated, however, and Mayakovsky often felt jealous and insecure about Brik's relationship with her husband. Despite this, they remained close until Mayakovsky's death.</p><p>Mayakovsky's legacy also includes his role as a cultural ambassador for the Soviet Union. He traveled extensively throughout Europe and the United States, giving lectures and readings of his work. He also designed many propaganda posters and advertisements for the Soviet government, promoting the ideals of communism and the values of the Soviet state.</p><p>Despite his unwavering support for the Soviet regime, Mayakovsky's work was not always well received. His avant-garde style and political engagement were often seen as controversial, and his poems and plays were frequently censored by Soviet authorities. Nevertheless, his impact on Russian literature and art cannot be denied, and his legacy continues to influence artists and writers around the world.</p><p>In addition to his political and artistic contributions, Mayakovsky was also known for his involvement in the creation of the ROSTA Windows, a type of propaganda poster that used a combination of text and graphic design to promote Bolshevik ideals. Mayakovsky worked as an artist and designer for ROSTA and produced many of these posters himself. His inventive use of typography and bold graphics made these posters highly effective tools for spreading Communist ideology.</p><p>Mayakovsky's work continues to inspire new generations of artists and writers, and his legacy remains a vital part of Russian cultural history. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in his life and work, with new translations and critical studies bringing his poetry and plays to a wider audience. Today, Mayakovsky is celebrated not only as a towering figure of the Russian avant-garde but also as a passionate advocate for social justice and a visionary artist who helped shape the modern world.</p><p></p><p>

He frequently collaborated with his twin brother Scotty, as well as Caldwell and Hutson, to create the group's signature sound.</p><p>Scott's dedication to philanthropy was also a major part of his life.

He struggled with diabetes for many years before his death, and his health problems often interfered with his ability to perform. In addition, Scott battled substance abuse issues, which eventually led to his departure from The Whispers in the early 1980s. Despite these challenges, Scott remained dedicated to his music and to helping others through his philanthropy.</p><p>In the years since his passing, Walter Scott's legacy has continued to inspire and influence musicians around the world.

(December 28, 1931		Paris-November 30, 1994			Bellevue-la-Montagne)

	
		otherwise known as Guy-Ernest Debord, G.E. Debord or Guy Ernest Debord

	
was
a French
philosopher, screenwriter, film director and writer.


					</p><p>He is best known as the founder and key member of the Situationist International, a group of artists, writers and intellectuals who rejected mainstream culture and promoted radical politics in the 1950s and 60s. Debord's most influential work was the book "The Society of the Spectacle," which critiques the culture of consumerism and the effects of media on society. He also directed two films, "Hurlements en Faveur de Sade" and "Critique de la Separation," and wrote several other books including "Comments on the Society of the Spectacle" and "Panegyric." Debord died by suicide in 1994 at age 62. His ideas and works continue to influence contemporary cultural and political movements around the world.</p><p>Debord's early life was marked by political activism and anti-authoritarianism. He was heavily involved in the Lettrist movement, which sought to subvert social norms through experimental art and literature. In 1957, he and other members of the Lettrist movement merged with several other avant-garde groups to form the Situationist International. The SI quickly became known for its radicalism and its critique of consumer culture, urbanism, and the state.</p><p>Debord's work on the spectacle and the society of the spectacle has been influential across a wide range of fields, from media studies to urban planning. In essence, Debord argued that modern life is defined by a kind of relentless image-making: we are constantly bombarded with images and messages that shape our desires, beliefs, and behaviors. These images, in turn, reinforce the power structures of capitalism and the state, keeping us docile and disconnected from one another. Debord believed that the only way to resist the society of the spectacle was to engage in radical forms of subversion and create new ways of living.</p><p>Debord's films, while not well-known, were also notable for their experimentalism and their rejection of traditional narrative structures. Hurlements en Faveur de Sade (Howls for Sade) was a collaboration with Spanish filmmaker Jorgen Leth, and was a heavily abstracted portrayal of Sade's life and work. Critique de la Separation (Critique of Separation) was similarly unconventional, combining found footage, text, and voice-over narration to explore themes of isolation and detachment.</p><p>Although Debord's ideas and work have been criticized for their sometimes dogmatic and confrontational nature, they remain influential both in academic circles and in activist communities. Many of his concepts have been taken up by contemporary social movements, from Occupy Wall Street to the Yellow Vests in France. Debord's legacy is a complex one, but there is no doubt that his work has had a lasting impact on our understanding of media, politics, and social change.</p><p>In addition to his activism and artistic pursuits, Debord was also a prolific writer. He authored several books and essays on topics ranging from art and culture to politics and revolution. "Comments on the Society of the Spectacle" was a follow-up to his seminal work, expanding on and refining his ideas about the ways in which images and media shape our perceptions of reality. "Panegyric," written after his departure from the Situationist International, was a deeply personal reflection on his own life and experiences. It has been described as a mixture of autobiography, philosophy, and poetry. </p><p>Debord's personal life was often tumultuous. He struggled with alcoholism and had several failed relationships. His suicide in 1994, at his home in Bellevue-la-Montagne, came as a shock to many of his closest friends and allies. However, it also served to solidify his legacy as a radical thinker and activist. Many of his admirers saw his suicide as a final act of rebellion against a society that he had spent his life critiquing and attempting to subvert. </p><p>Today, Debord's ideas continue to be debated and discussed in academic and activist circles around the world. His critiques of consumer culture and mass media have become even more relevant in the digital age, where the lines between reality and fiction are increasingly blurred. Debord's influence can be seen in a variety of contemporary cultural movements, from the punk and post-punk scenes of the 1970s and 80s to the current resurgence of interest in the Situationists and their ideas. Regardless of one's opinions of his work or politics, there is no denying that Guy Debord left an indelible mark on the world of art, philosophy, and political activism.</p><p>Debord's legacy also extends to his contributions to the field of psychogeography, which he defined as "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, whether consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals." Debord believed that the built environment had a profound impact on our perceptions and experiences, and he advocated for the creation of alternative urban spaces that would encourage social interaction and spontaneity. He and other members of the Situationist International developed a series of experimental techniques, such as the dérive (drift), which involved walking through a city without a predetermined destination, in order to explore the hidden potentials of urban space.</p><p>Debord's influence can also be seen in the work of numerous contemporary artists, writers, and activists who share his commitment to challenging the dominant cultural and political frameworks of their time. From the radical politics of the punk and post-punk movements to the anti-globalization protests of the late 1990s and early 2000s, Debord's ideas have been taken up by a wide range of cultural and political movements around the world. In recent years, his work has enjoyed a renewed interest among scholars and activists alike, as new generations grapple with the ongoing challenges of creating a more just and equitable world.</p><p>Debord's influence on contemporary cultural and political movements has also been seen in the rise of digital activism and social media. The concepts he explored in his work, such as the manipulation of images and the creation of spectacle, have become even more relevant in the age of social media, where people are bombarded with information and targeted messages on a daily basis. Many activists have taken up Debord's ideas about the need for radical subversion and counter-culture in order to resist the dominant power structures of society. By questioning the status quo and creating alternative spaces and narratives, they hope to spark social change and build a better world.</p><p>Debord's impact has also been felt in the world of art and literature. His ideas about the intersection of art and politics have inspired generations of artists, writers, and filmmakers to explore new and unconventional forms of expression. His critiques of consumer culture and media have influenced the development of avant-garde movements such as post-modernism and post-structuralism. Even today, filmmakers and artists continue to draw inspiration from Debord's work, exploring the boundaries between reality and fiction, and questioning the power of images and media in shaping our perceptions of the world.</p><p>In summary, Guy Debord was a key figure in the Situationist International, a radical group that rejected mainstream culture and promoted subversive politics. Through his work, he critiqued the society of the spectacle and the effects of media on our perceptions and behaviors. His ideas continue to influence activism, art, and political movements around the world today, and his legacy remains an important contribution to the study of art, politics, and philosophy.</p><p></p><p>

(February 17, 1942		Monroe-August 22, 1989			Oakland)

	
		also known as Huey Newton or Newton, Huey

	
was
an American
political activist.


					</p><p>He is best known as one of the co-founders of the Black Panther Party, a revolutionary political organization in the 1960s that aimed to protect African American communities from police brutality and promote self-sufficiency. Newton was a powerful speaker and writer, and his ideas about black liberation and self-defense had a major impact on the Civil Rights Movement. He faced legal troubles throughout his life and spent time in prison, but he continued to advocate for social justice and create change until his untimely death at the age of 47.</p><p>After the Black Panther Party collapsed in the late 1970s due to internal conflicts and government repression, Newton struggled with drug addiction and run-ins with the law. However, he also continued to work for social change, founding the Huey P. Newton Foundation in 1993 to promote education and youth development in disadvantaged communities. Newton's political legacy has had a lasting impact on American activism and his ideas continue to inspire and inform social justice movements today.</p><p>During his time as a student at Merritt College, Newton became involved in the civil rights movement and actively participated in protests and demonstrations against segregation and discrimination. He co-founded the Black Panther Party along with Bobby Seale in 1966, after witnessing and experiencing police brutality in his community. Newton developed the Party's Ten-Point Program, which called for economic, political, and social equality for African Americans. Under his leadership, the Black Panther Party became a powerful political force and expanded its activities to include community social programs such as free breakfast programs for children.</p><p>Throughout his life, Newton faced multiple legal issues and arrests, including for the murder of a police officer, which he maintained was a case of self-defense. After being incarcerated for over two years, he was released and began to focus on social and community activism. In addition to the Huey P. Newton Foundation, he also co-founded the Poor People's Revolutionary Survival Program, which provided free health care and legal aid to disadvantaged communities.</p><p>Newton's impact on the black freedom struggle cannot be overstated; his unapologetic advocacy for Black self-determination and revolutionary change inspired a generation of Black activists and scholars. He left behind a legacy of political courage and commitment to social justice that continues to inspire activists and organizers today.</p><p>Notably, Newton also earned a PhD in social philosophy from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1980, where he developed a theory of revolutionary humanism that drew on the ideas of Frantz Fanon and Mao Zedong. He also wrote several books, including "Revolutionary Suicide," which recounted his experiences in the Black Panther Party and explored his political philosophy. Newton's activism and writing emphasized the importance of building unity among oppressed groups and creating a truly democratic society that valued the dignity and worth of all people. Despite facing constant surveillance and harassment from the FBI and other government agencies, he remained committed to advancing the cause of black liberation and creating a society free from oppression and inequality. Today, Newton is remembered as a powerful figure in the civil rights movement and an inspiration to all those who continue to fight for social justice and human rights.</p><p>In addition to his political activism, Huey P. Newton was also a major figure in the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s. He was an avid reader and writer and saw the arts as an important tool for social and political change. Newton also had a deep interest in science and technology and saw the need for African Americans to have greater access to education and opportunities in these fields. He advocated for the development of community-based science and technology programs that would empower young people of color to pursue careers in these areas.</p><p>Newton's legacy extends beyond the United States as well. His ideas and activism had a major impact on international liberation struggles, particularly in Africa and Asia. He was a vocal supporter of anti-colonial movements and was inspired by the ideas of leaders such as Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara. Newton also traveled to China and met with Mao Zedong, forging connections between the Black Panther Party and the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>Despite his controversial reputation, Huey P. Newton remains an important figure in American history and his contributions to the struggle for racial justice and equality continue to inspire activists today. His legacy is a testament to the power of grassroots organizing, intellectual rigor, and a commitment to social justice.</p><p></p><p>

(April 15, 1950		District Six-December 16, 2006)


was
a South African
singer and musician.


					</p><p>He was known for his contributions to the Cape Malay music genre, which is a blend of traditional South African rhythms and Malay melodies. Petersen began his music career in the 1970s as a member of the performing group, Golden City Dixies. He later formed the band, Spokean Folk, which played a pivotal role in the development of Cape Jazz.</p><p>Petersen also composed and produced musicals, including the highly acclaimed, "Kat and the Kings," which won the Olivier Award in 1999. The musical was a tribute to District Six, a culturally diverse area of Cape Town that was forcibly evacuated during apartheid.</p><p>Throughout his career, Petersen was a strong advocate for social justice and used his music to address issues such as racism and poverty. He was awarded the Order of Disa by the Western Cape Provincial Government in recognition of his contributions to the arts and culture of South Africa.</p><p>Petersen grew up in District Six, an area known for its vibrant culture and music scene. However, his childhood was marred by the forced removals of residents during apartheid in the 1960s. This experience had a lasting impact on Petersen and inspired much of his work as an artist.</p><p>In addition to his musical career and activism, Petersen was also heavily involved in the education sector. He founded the Taliep Petersen Music Academy in 1995, which provided young people from disadvantaged communities with the opportunity to study music and the arts. Many of his students went on to have successful careers in the industry.</p><p>Tragically, Petersen was murdered in his home in 2006, which sent shockwaves through the South African music community. However, his legacy lives on through his music, his advocacy for social justice, and the many people he inspired through his work as a musician and educator.</p><p>Petersen's music has been praised for its ability to cross cultural divides and bring people together. In particular, his Cape Malay songs have resonated with audiences both within and outside of South Africa. He was often referred to as the "King of Cape Malay Music" and was celebrated for his unique voice and lyrical style.</p><p>One of his most famous works, "District Six: The Musical," premiered in 1987 and was based on Petersen's experiences growing up in the area. The musical was widely acclaimed and went on to enjoy a successful run both in South Africa and overseas.</p><p>Petersen was also known for collaborating with other artists, including his longtime friend and frequent collaborator David Kramer. Together, they wrote and performed several successful works, including "Flopstreet" and "Petruska."</p><p>Despite facing numerous obstacles during his career, including censorship and the ongoing effects of apartheid, Petersen remained committed to his art and his activism. He believed deeply in the power of music to effect change and to bring people together across racial and cultural divides.</p><p>Today, Petersen is remembered as one of South Africa's most beloved musicians and cultural icons. His contributions to the Cape Malay music genre and his tireless advocacy for social justice continue to inspire new generations of artists and activists.</p><p>In addition to his musical talents, Taliep Petersen also had acting experience. He appeared in several productions, including the 1991 film "Boesman and Lena" alongside actors Angela Bassett and Danny Glover. Petersen was also involved in the creation of the District Six Museum, which preserves the history and culture of the area where he grew up. He served as a trustee of the museum and contributed much of his personal archive to the institution. Petersen's commitment to preserving the culture and history of District Six was a testament to his love for his community and his determination to keep its memory alive.</p><p>Furthermore, Taliep Petersen was a true pioneer in the Cape Town music scene. In addition to his work with Spokean Folk, he formed the music production company, Triple M, which helped produce several groundbreaking albums, including "Bo-Kaap Revisited" and "District Six." Petersen's ability to blend traditional local rhythms and sounds with international genres like jazz and pop created a unique sound that set him apart from his peers. His music was not only loved in South Africa but also internationally. </p><p>Petersen's tragic murder in 2006 shook the music community to its core. However, his family and colleagues made sure that his legacy continued. The Taliep Petersen Foundation was established in his honor, with the goal of continuing his passion for the arts and education. The foundation has supported several initiatives, including music schools, scholarships, and various cultural activities. </p><p>Taliep Petersen's passing was a great loss for the South African music and arts community. However, his substantial contributions to the Cape Malay music genre and his advocacy for social justice continue to inspire new generations of artists and activists in South Africa and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
