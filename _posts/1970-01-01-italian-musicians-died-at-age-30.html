He was raised in a large family and developed a passion for flying at an early age. He graduated from the University of Dayton with a degree in engineering and then enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1941.</p><p>Gentile's combat career began in the Mediterranean theater, where he flew the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk.

Richard Bong intercepted a formation of German aircraft over Germany. In a furious battle, the two American pilots shot down eight German planes, with Gentile accounting for five of them. This feat earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest military award in the United States Army.</p><p>After the war, Gentile remained in the Air Force and flew a variety of planes, including the F-86 Sabre during the Korean War. On January 28, 1951, he was killed in a crash while testing a new airplane at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.

(January 26, 1919		Cassano d&#039;Adda-May 4, 1949			Superga)


was
an Italian
personality.


					</p><p>Valentino Mazzola was a former professional footballer who played as an inside forward for Italian club side Torino and the Italian national team. He was considered one of the best players of his generation and was known for his skill and creativity on the pitch. Mazzola was a vital part of the legendary Grande Torino team that dominated Italian football in the 1940s, winning five consecutive Serie A titles. His tragic death in the Superga air disaster, along with the rest of the team, is still mourned by football fans in Italy and around the world.</p><p>Valentino Mazzola was born and raised in Cassano d&#039;Adda, a town in the Lombardy region of Italy. He started playing football at a young age and quickly showed promise, joining his local team, Cassanese, and later moving up to play for Atalanta. In 1942, he signed for Torino, which would prove to be the peak of his footballing career.</p><p>Mazzola was a stylish and versatile player, equally adept at scoring goals and setting them up for his teammates. He formed a deadly partnership on the pitch with his fellow inside forward, Ezio Loik, and together they helped Torino to run riot over their opponents in the 1940s. Mazzola scored 109 goals in 191 appearances for the club, making him one of their all-time greats.</p><p>Mazzola was also a regular for the Italian national team, earning 12 caps between 1940 and 1947. He was part of the squad that won the Central European International Cup in 1942 and helped Italy to reach the quarter-finals of the 1950 World Cup, although he did not play in the tournament due to injury.</p><p>Tragically, Mazzola&#039;s life was cut short when he was just 30 years old. On May 4, 1949, he was one of 31 people onboard a plane that was flying the Torino team back from a friendly match in Lisbon, Portugal. The plane crashed into the hill of Superga, near Turin, killing everyone onboard. Mazzola and his teammates were mourned across the footballing world, and their legacy lives on to this day.</p><p>Valentino Mazzola was not only a great footballer but also a devoted family man. He was married to Emilia Mambretti, and they had three children together, all of whom were born during his time at Torino. His son, Sandro Mazzola, also went on to become a successful footballer, playing in Italy's Serie A for Inter Milan and the national team.</p><p>Mazzola's legacy is not just limited to his on-field achievements. He is remembered in Italy as a symbol of the country's post-war resurgence, and his tragic death is seen as a symbol of a generation's hopes and dreams cut short. In his hometown of Cassano d'Adda, there is a street named after him, and a statue of him was also erected in the town in 2004.</p><p>In 2019, on the 100th anniversary of his birth, Italian football clubs paid tribute to Valentino Mazzola, and his memory was commemorated at a special event at the Superga Basilica. His impact on Italian football is still felt today, and his tragic death has become an integral part of the sport's history in Italy.</p><p></p><p>
