(March 25, 1927		Timmins-August 26, 1951			Cochrane)


was
a Canadian
ice hockey player.


					</p><p>Barilko was a defenseman for the Toronto Maple Leafs from 1946 until his death in 1951. He scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in overtime in 1951, and the goal was the last one he would ever score as he disappeared later that year on a fishing trip. His body and the wreckage of the plane were not discovered until 1962, which became the subject of the hit song "The Tragically Hip." Despite only playing for five seasons in the NHL, Barilko's legacy has had a significant impact on Canadian sports and culture.</p><p>Barilko was born in Timmins, Ontario and grew up playing hockey on frozen creeks and lakes in the area. He was known for his rough playing style and was considered one of the toughest defensemen in the league during his time. In addition to the 1951 Stanley Cup-winning goal, Barilko also scored the game-winning goal in the 1950 Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings. His number 5 jersey was retired by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1951 and he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962, the same year his remains were found. Barilko's story has been the subject of books, documentaries, and movies, and his memory lives on as a symbol of the passion and dedication of Canadian hockey players.</p><p>Off the ice, Barilko was described as a quiet and humble individual who kept to himself. He was also an accomplished amateur pilot, and it was his passion for flying that ultimately led to his tragic death. On August 26, 1951, Barilko and a friend embarked on a fishing trip aboard a small plane. The plane never returned, and an extensive search was launched to find it. Despite several attempts, no trace of the plane or its passengers was found until 11 years later when a helicopter pilot discovered the wreckage in the dense forest near Cochrane, Ontario. </p><p>Barilko's untimely death sparked an outpouring of grief from fans across Canada, and his legacy has continued to inspire a new generation of hockey players. In addition to his Hockey Hall of Fame induction, he was also honored with a monument outside the Ontario legislature building in Toronto, as well as a park and community center named after him in his hometown of Timmins. His story has become an important part of Canadian folklore, and his Stanley Cup-winning goal remains one of the most iconic moments in NHL history.</p><p>Barilko's disappearance for 11 years also influenced Canadian singer-songwriter Gord Downie, who wrote a song about him called "Fifty Mission Cap" while fronting the band, The Tragically Hip. The song was based on a conversation Downie had with his friend, hockey historian Bill Fitsell, about Barilko's story. The Tragically Hip's song brought Barilko's story to a wider audience in Canada and is now considered one of the band's most iconic songs. The song even helped solve the mystery of Barilko's death as it led to a search for the wreckage in the location described in the song's lyrics. The following year, the wreckage was finally found in the exact spot mentioned in the song. The story of Bill Barilko and his enduring legacy continue to inspire Canadians and hockey fans worldwide.</p><p></p><p>
