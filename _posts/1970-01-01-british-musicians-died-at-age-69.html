He was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 1888 for his contributions to science. In addition to his scientific pursuits, Reynolds was also an accomplished mountaineer and often spent his free time climbing in the Alps.</p><p>Reynolds' most notable contribution to fluid mechanics was his publication of a paper titled "An experimental investigation of the circumstances which determine whether the motion of water shall be direct or sinuous, and of the law of resistance in parallel channels" in the Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions in 1883. In this paper, Reynolds used dye to observe the flow of water in a pipe and found that the flow transitioned from laminar to turbulent depending on the velocity and viscosity of the fluid as well as the diameter of the pipe. He also discovered a dimensionless quantity that now bears his name, the Reynolds number, which can predict whether fluid flow will be laminar or turbulent. </p><p>Reynolds was a professor of engineering at the University of Manchester and also served as the President of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. He was renowned for his teaching, and his popular lecture on the motion of water is said to have influenced many young engineers during his time. </p><p>Reynolds was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1877 and was awarded the Rumford Medal in 1888. He was also awarded the Franklin Medal by the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in 1900. Today, Reynolds' work is still widely used in engineering and fluid mechanics, and the Reynolds number is a fundamental concept in the field.</p><p></p><p>

						</p><p>Havers was born in Bushey, Hertfordshire, and educated at Westminster School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. After serving in World War II, he was called to the bar at Inner Temple in 1948, and became a QC in 1964. He was known for his expertise in prosecuting criminal cases, and was appointed Solicitor General in 1972 and Attorney General in 1979.</p><p>As Attorney General, Havers played a key role in a number of high-profile cases, including the prosecution of the killers of Airey Neave, the Conservative politician who was assassinated by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) in 1979. He was also involved in the prosecution of the so-called "Yorkshire Ripper", Peter Sutcliffe, and the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven, cases which later came under scrutiny for wrongful convictions.</p><p>In addition to his legal career, Havers was a Conservative MP for Wimbledon from 1970 to 1987, and was made a life peer as Baron Havers of St. Edmundsbury in 1987. He served as Lord Chancellor under Margaret Thatcher from 1987 until 1992, and was known for his conservative views and tough-on-crime policies. He died in 1992 after a battle with cancer.</p><p>During his time as Lord Chancellor, Havers faced controversy due to his handling of the case of the "Westland Affair", which involved a UK helicopter manufacturer that was the subject of a potential government-backed rescue deal. Havers was accused of having a conflict of interest due to his brother holding a directorship in the company involved in the deal. Despite this, Havers maintained the deal was in the country's best interest and that he had acted properly throughout the affair.</p><p>Beyond his legal and political career, Havers was also involved in several charitable causes, including serving as Chairman of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) from 1990 until his death. In recognition of his contributions to the legal profession and public service, Havers was awarded the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1990.</p><p>Today, Havers is remembered as one of the UK's most prominent legal figures, known for his expertise in criminal law and his staunch conservatism. Despite some controversies during his career, he remains respected for his commitment to justice and public service.</p><p></p><p>
