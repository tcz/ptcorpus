						</p><p>Munio Weinraub was born on April 5, 1915 in Israel. He studied architecture at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem and later in Paris. Weinraub was one of the leading architects of the Bauhaus movement in Israel and was a founding member of the Israeli Association of United Architects. He designed many important buildings in Israel, including the Lassalle House in Tel Aviv and the central bus station in Jerusalem. In addition to his architectural work, Weinraub was an avid photographer and his photographs have been displayed in exhibitions around the world. He passed away on April 5, 1970, on his 55th birthday. His legacy continues through his son, Amos Gitai, who is a renowned filmmaker.</p><p>Munio Weinraub was also known for his contributions to the design of the Israeli Pavilion at the 1958 World Expo in Brussels, where he collaborated with artist Dani Karavan. Weinraub's architectural style was characterized by clean lines, functionalism, and a minimalist approach. He believed that architecture should serve the needs of the people who inhabit a space and that buildings should be designed with simplicity and functionality in mind. He was also interested in the relationship between architecture and the surrounding environment, and many of his buildings feature large windows and open spaces that allow natural light to enter and create a sense of connection with the outdoors. Munio Weinraub's legacy as an architect and photographer has had a significant impact on Israeli culture and continues to inspire generations of architects and artists.</p><p>Weinraub's architectural works became influential for many architects in the country, and his designs often feature in architectural textbooks. One innovative project Weinraub worked on was the "Model Home" in Tel Aviv, which was designed for the 1936 "Housing and Construction" exhibition. The home's design, which included an indoor patio and glass partition walls, was ahead of its time and has since been recognized as a significant milestone in modern Israeli architecture. In addition to his architecture and photography work, Weinraub was also a passionate collector of Israeli and Palestinian folk art, which he often displayed in his home. His interest in folk art informed his architectural designs, as he believed that buildings should reflect the local cultural context in which they are built. Despite his untimely death at the age of 55, Munio Weinraub's contributions to Israeli architecture and art continue to shape the country's cultural landscape.</p><p></p><p>
