					</p><p>Anny Ondra began her acting career in Prague in the 1920s before eventually moving to Berlin to work in German cinema. She appeared in over 100 films throughout her career, including the role of Alice in the famous silent film "Blackmail" directed by Alfred Hitchcock. However, her Czech accent caused difficulties with the sound production of Hitchcock's first talkie film, so her voice was dubbed by Joan Barry. </p><p>In addition to her acting career, Ondra was also a film producer, working on films such as "Grosstadtmelodie" and "Moravská lidová píseň". She married boxer Max Schmeling in 1933, and the couple remained together until her death in 1987. Ondra received several awards for her work in film, including the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.</p><p>Despite her success as an actor, Anny Ondra's career was cut short by World War II. She and her husband Max Schmeling were briefly imprisoned by the Nazis, and they eventually fled to Switzerland to escape persecution. After the war, Ondra devoted most of her time to her husband and their family, though she did make occasional appearances in films such as "The Visit" and "The Brothers Karamazov". She remained active in the film industry as a producer and consultant, and was known for her keen eye and business acumen. Outside of her career, Ondra was also known for her philanthropy and advocacy work, particularly on behalf of children and animals. She died in 1987 at the age of 83, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most talented and beloved actors of her time.</p><p></p><p>
