(June 1, 1300		Brotherton-August 4, 1338)


was
an English
personality.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Alice of Norfolk and Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk.

						</p><p>Thomas of Brotherton was the fifth son of King Edward I of England and his second wife, Margaret of France. He was named after his mother's home county of Brotherton in Yorkshire. Despite being a prince, Thomas did not play a significant role in politics or military affairs during his lifetime. However, he held several important titles, including Earl Marshal, Lord Marshal, and Earl of Norfolk.</p><p>As a young man, Thomas fought in Scotland alongside his father and elder brother, Edward II. He was also present at the famous Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, where the English army was defeated by the Scots under Robert the Bruce. Later in life, Thomas served as a diplomat, representing his brother, King Edward III, in negotiations with France and Flanders.</p><p>Thomas was known for his extravagant lifestyle and love of hunting. He owned several estates throughout England, including the castles of Framlingham in Suffolk and Harewood in Yorkshire. He also commissioned several works of art and literature, including the famous romance poem, "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight."</p><p>Despite his wealth and power, however, Thomas's personal life was marked by tragedy. His wife, Alice Hales, died young, leaving him bereft. Thomas never remarried, and after his death, his fortune was divided between his two daughters. Today, Thomas of Brotherton is remembered primarily for his role as a member of the royal family and his patronage of the arts, rather than for any particular accomplishments or achievements.</p><p>Thomas of Brotherton was also known for his involvement in the Order of Knights Hospitaller, which was a religious military order that provided care for pilgrims to the Holy Land. He was initiated into the order at a young age and rose to the position of Grand Prior, becoming the head of the English branch of the order. This role involved managing the order's estates in England and overseeing its charitable activities.</p><p>Despite his lack of political influence, Thomas was well-respected by his family and peers. He was known for his chivalry and generosity, and was often called upon to settle disputes between members of the aristocracy. When his older brother, Edward II, was overthrown and imprisoned, Thomas remained loyal to him and tried unsuccessfully to secure his release.</p><p>Thomas of Brotherton died in 1338 at the age of 38. He was buried in the priory of the Knights Hospitaller in Clerkenwell, London. His daughter Alice went on to marry Edward Montagu, while his younger daughter Margaret married John Segrave, 4th Baron Segrave. The Earldom of Norfolk, which had been created for Thomas in 1312, passed to his nephew, Thomas of Woodstock, upon his death.</p><p></p><p>
