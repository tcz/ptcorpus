							Zbigniew Cybulski is considered one of Poland's most iconic and influential actors of all time, particularly for his work during the 1950s and 60s. He first gained popularity for his role in the film "Night Train", which went on to win multiple awards at the Cannes Film Festival. He is also known for his collaborations with director Andrzej Wajda, including their work on the film "Ashes and Diamonds". Cybulski's performances were characterized by his rebellious and playful spirit, and he became a symbol of Poland's cultural and artistic renaissance during the post-war period. Tragically, he died at the young age of 40 after falling under an oncoming train in Wrocław train station, which has been the subject of much discussion and speculation over the years. Despite his short career, Cybulski's impact and legacy are still felt today.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=2107478" title="Wikipedia article about Zbigniew Cybulski">Zbigniew Cybulski on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>George E.
