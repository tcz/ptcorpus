was
an Irish
physician and author.


					
			
		He had
		six
		children,
		Oscar Wilde, Willie Wilde, Isola Wilde, Henry Wilson, Emily Wilde and Mary Wilde.

						</p><p>William Wilde was known for his pioneering work on diseases of the eye and ear, as well as his contributions to Irish archaeology and folklore. He was a co-founder of the St. Mark's Ophthalmic Hospital in Dublin, which was one of the first hospitals in the world to specialize in eye care. In addition to his medical work, Wilde was also a prolific writer and an expert on Irish folklore and mythology. He published numerous articles and books on these subjects, including "Irish Popular Superstitions" and "Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland". Despite his many achievements, Wilde's reputation was tarnished by scandal when he was implicated in a high-profile adultery case in 1864. Nevertheless, he continued to practice medicine and pursue his interests until his death in 1876. Today, he is remembered as an important figure in the history of medicine and Irish culture.</p><p>In addition to his work in medicine and folklore, William Wilde was also a keen supporter of the arts. He was a member of the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, and he founded the Irish Archaeological Society in 1840. He also served as the editor of the Dublin University Magazine, which published the early works of his son, Oscar Wilde. </p><p>William Wilde was born in the village of Kilkeevin, near Castlerea in County Roscommon, Ireland. His father was a successful eye and ear surgeon, and young William followed in his footsteps, studying medicine at Trinity College Dublin. After completing his studies, he worked as an assistant surgeon at the Dublin Eye and Ear Infirmary before establishing his own ophthalmic practice in Dublin. </p><p>In addition to his medical and literary pursuits, William Wilde was also a noted philanthropist. He was actively involved in efforts to alleviate poverty and improve living conditions for the poor in Dublin's slums. He was a supporter of the temperance movement and a vocal opponent of the use of alcohol and drugs. </p><p>Despite his achievements, William Wilde's personal life was not without controversy. In 1851, he married Jane Francesca Agnes Elgee, a writer and poet who used the pen name "Speranza". The couple would go on to have two sons and a daughter, including the famous writer Oscar Wilde. However, William was known to have numerous extramarital affairs, and in 1864 he was sued for criminal conversation by a woman named Mary Travers. The scandal caused a public outcry, and although William was eventually cleared of the charges, his reputation never fully recovered. </p><p>William Wilde died of acute meningitis at the age of 61. He is buried in St. Ann's Churchyard in Dawson Street, Dublin. Despite the scandal that marred his reputation, William Wilde is remembered today as a pioneering physician, scholar, and cultural figure who made lasting contributions to the fields of medicine, folklore, and archaeology.</p><p>William Wilde was also a renowned traveler, having journeyed to Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East where he gathered information about the customs, traditions, and cultural practices of the people he met. He documented his travels in a book titled "Lough Corrib, Its Shores and Islands," which detailed the rural life in Ireland. He was also an avid collector of antiquities and amassed an impressive collection of artifacts from various cultures, which were housed in his home and later donated to the National Museum of Ireland. In recognition of his contributions to medicine, he was knighted in 1864 by Queen Victoria. His son, Oscar Wilde, would go on to become one of the most famous writers of the Victorian era, known for his wit, aestheticism, and homosexuality. However, William never lived to see his son's literary success, as he died two years before the publication of his first book. Nonetheless, his legacy lives on, and his contributions to medicine and Irish culture continue to be celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>
