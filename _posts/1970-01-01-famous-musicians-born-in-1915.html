(August 26, 1915		Den Helder-December 14, 1999)

	
		also known as Gre Brouwenstijn

	
was
a Dutch
singer.


						</p><p>She is considered one of the greatest Wagnerian sopranos of the 20th century, known for her powerful and dramatic interpretations of roles such as Isolde in Tristan und Isolde and Brünnhilde in the Ring Cycle. Brouwenstijn began her career in the 1940s, performing primarily in the Netherlands before gaining international recognition in the 1950s. She was particularly associated with the Royal Opera House in London, where she made her debut in 1951 and performed frequently throughout her career. Brouwenstijn also appeared at many other major opera houses, including the Metropolitan Opera in New York, the Bayreuth Festival in Germany, and La Scala in Milan. In addition to her operatic work, she was also a respected concert singer and recorded extensively.</p><p>Despite her success, Brouwenstijn retired relatively early from performing in 1966, at the age of 51, due to health issues. She continued to teach and mentor young singers, passing on her knowledge and expertise to future generations. In 1989, she received the Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau, one of the highest honors awarded to citizens of the Netherlands, in recognition of her contributions to the arts. Brouwenstijn passed away in 1999 at the age of 84. Today, she is remembered as one of the greatest Wagnerian sopranos in history, with a legacy that continues to inspire and influence opera singers around the world.</p><p>Brouwenstijn's early life was marked by tragedy: her mother passed away when she was only six years old, and her father died a few years later. Despite these difficulties, Brouwenstijn showed early musical talent and attended the Amsterdam Conservatory, where she studied with several renowned vocal coaches. Her career took off during World War II, when she sang with the Dutch National Opera (then known as the Dutchman's Opera), which had been founded by a group of musicians who were opposed to the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. Brouwenstijn's performances with the company, which aimed to preserve Dutch cultural heritage in the face of Nazi censorship, earned her a reputation as a skilled interpreter of both classical and contemporary works.</p><p>After the war, Brouwenstijn continued to perform with the Dutch National Opera, but also began to attract attention from international audiences. Her London debut in 1951, as Leonore in Beethoven's Fidelio, was a triumph, and she quickly became a frequent guest at Covent Garden. Brouwenstijn's passionate, emotionally charged performances in Wagner operas won her critical acclaim, and she was praised for her ability to convey both the heroic and vulnerable aspects of characters like Isolde and Brünnhilde. In addition to her successful opera career, Brouwenstijn was also a popular concert singer, and her recordings of lieder by composers like Schubert and Brahms are still regarded as definitive interpretations. </p><p>Throughout her life, Brouwenstijn remained devoted to the Netherlands and its culture, and was known for her efforts to promote Dutch composers and musicians. She was married twice, and had two children. After her retirement from performing, she continued to teach and give masterclasses, and was known for her nurturing, supportive approach to young singers. In a career that spanned over two decades, Brouwenstijn cemented her place as one of the greatest sopranos of all time, and her legacy continues to inspire generations of musicians.</p><p></p><p>
