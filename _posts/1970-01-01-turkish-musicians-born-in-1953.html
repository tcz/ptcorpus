Noyan is known for his dynamic drumming style and for his contribution to the fusion of traditional Turkish music with rock and roll. Some of his most famous works include the album "Anadolu Pop 1" which was a milestone in the development of Turkish rock music.</p><p>In addition to his musical career, Noyan has also been active as a writer, publishing several books on topics ranging from music to philosophy. He is also a regular contributor to music magazines and has given lectures on the history of Turkish music at various universities.</p><p>Noyan has received numerous awards for his contributions to Turkish music and culture, including the prestigious "Golden Key" award, which is bestowed by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism. He continues to perform both solo and with Moğollar, and his innovative approach to music has cemented his place as one of Turkey's most influential musicians.</p><p>Noyan's interest in music began when he was just a teenager, and he was largely self-taught. He started playing the drums at the age of 15 before joining Moğollar in 1971. The band played a pivotal role in the development of Turkish rock music, and Noyan's dynamic drumming was a key part of their sound.</p><p>During his time with Moğollar, Noyan collaborated with several other musicians and helped to incorporate different styles of music into the band's repertoire. He also contributed to several albums with the band, including "Danses et Rythmes de la Turquie d'hier à aujourd'hui" which won critical acclaim.</p><p>Noyan's work as a writer has also garnered significant attention, with several of his books translated into English and other languages. He has written on a range of topics, including the history of Turkish music, the role of the musician in society, and the philosophy of music.</p><p>While Noyan has achieved significant success in his career, he remains committed to promoting Turkish culture and music both at home and abroad. He has been involved in numerous cultural projects and has worked to preserve and promote traditional Turkish music. Noyan is widely regarded as a pioneer in Turkish rock music and a leading figure in the country's music scene.</p><p>Noyan's influence on Turkish rock music extends beyond his time with Moğollar. He has collaborated with other Turkish musicians and has also worked with international artists such as Peter Gabriel and Mike Oldfield. His willingness to experiment with different genres and styles has led to him being credited with expanding the boundaries of Turkish rock music.</p><p>Noyan's impact on Turkish music and culture has been acknowledged through various honors and awards. He has received the title of "State Artist" from the Turkish government and was also awarded the "Lifetime Achievement Award" at the 2012 Istanbul Music Festival. In addition to this, he has been a judge on reality music competitions and has been a mentor to many aspiring musicians.</p><p>Despite his numerous achievements, Noyan remains humble and down-to-earth. He has expressed his gratitude for the opportunities he has had to share his music with the world and has dedicated himself to continuing to promote Turkish music for future generations.</p><p></p><p>
