He also explored the concept of the "will to power," which described the innate drive of human beings to assert their individuality and autonomy in the face of societal constraints. In addition to his work in psychoanalytic theory, Rank was a prolific writer and artist. He was a close friend of many influential thinkers and artists of his time, including Carl Jung, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Franz Kafka.
