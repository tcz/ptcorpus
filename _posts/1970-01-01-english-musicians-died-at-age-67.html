(August 7, 1852		Montpellier-December 19, 1919			South Mimms)

	
		also known as Arnold Harris Mathew or Arnold Harris Ochterlony Matthews

	
was
an English
bishop.


					</p><p>He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1884 and later became a bishop of the Old Catholic Church in Great Britain. In addition to his religious work, Mathew was a controversial figure due to his involvement with the Catholic Apostolic Church and claims of being the Archpriest of the Abbé Saunière, the priest rumored to have discovered a wealth of treasure in the French village of Rennes-le-Château. Mathew was also a prolific writer, authoring several books on religious topics and history, as well as a translator of medieval Latin and French texts. Despite his controversial reputation, Mathew is recognized as a significant figure in the history of independent Catholicism in England.</p><p>Mathew's involvement with the Catholic Apostolic Church began in his youth when he became a member of the church, which was a Christian sect that believed in the imminent return of Christ. Mathew eventually rose to the rank of apostle within the church but became disillusioned with its leadership and left the church in 1892.</p><p>In 1908, Mathew was consecrated as an Old Catholic bishop by Bishop Gerard Gul of the Netherlands, and he became the bishop of the Old Catholic Church in Great Britain. He established several parishes in England and also established the Old Catholic Press, which published many of his writings.</p><p>Mathew's claims of being the Archpriest of the Abbé Saunière and his alleged involvement in the mystery of Rennes-le-Château have been the subject of much speculation and controversy. Some have accused him of being a fraud and a charlatan, while others believe that he was unfairly maligned and that there may be some truth to his claims.</p><p>Mathew died in 1919, and his legacy remains a subject of debate among scholars of independent Catholicism and the mystery of Rennes-le-Château.</p><p>In addition to his religious and controversial pursuits, Arnold Mathew was also involved in politics. He ran unsuccessfully for a parliamentary seat as a candidate of the Social Democratic Federation in 1885. Later in life, he supported Irish nationalism and joined Sinn Féin, a political party advocating for Irish independence. Mathew was also an advocate for animal rights and abstained from consuming meat. Despite his idiosyncrasies, Mathew's influence can still be seen in the Old Catholic Church, which he helped to establish in England. Today, the Old Catholic Church traces its roots to the Jansenist movement of the 17th century and maintains a separate existence from the Roman Catholic Church  while still maintaining apostolic succession.</p><p></p><p>

His outspoken views often put him at odds with both Catholic and Protestant authorities, and he lived in constant fear of persecution.</p><p>Despite these challenges, John Bale remained a committed and passionate advocate for the ideals of the Reformation.

(June 1, 1889		Fleetwood-March 21, 1957			London)

	
		also known as C. K. Ogden or C.K. Ogden

	
was
an English
philosopher.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on language and communication, particularly for inventing Basic English, a simplified version of English that consisted of only 850 words, intended for international communication. Ogden also founded the Orthological Institute in 1923, which was dedicated to the study and improvement of language. In addition to his work in philosophy and linguistics, Ogden was a polymath who wrote on a wide range of topics, including education, psychology, and religion. Through his work, he sought to eliminate barriers of communication and promote international understanding.</p><p>Ogden began his career as a schoolteacher, but later he turned to writing and publishing. In 1922, he published "The Meaning of Meaning," which he co-wrote with linguist I.A. Richards. The book was a pioneering work in the field of semiotics and had a significant impact on literary theory. It expanded the horizons of literary criticism and paved the way for the development of modern sociolinguistics.</p><p>Ogden was also an accomplished lexicographer and compiled several dictionaries, including "The Basic Words of English" (1930) and "The ABC of Basic English" (1932). He travelled extensively throughout Europe and Asia, promoting Basic English as a means of international communication. During World War II, he served as a consultant on language and propaganda to the British government.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Ogden's work fell out of favor in the decades following his death. However, in recent years, his ideas have seen a resurgence of interest in the fields of linguistics, philosophy, and education. Today, he is remembered as a visionary thinker who sought to bridge the gaps between languages and cultures.</p><p>Ogden was born in Fleetwood, Lancashire, England, in 1889. He grew up in a working-class family, and his early experiences fostered a strong sense of social justice that remained with him throughout his life. He attended the University of London, where he studied philosophy and psychology, and later earned a master's degree in education from Harvard University. He went on to lecture at several universities and colleges, including the University of London, the University of Chicago, and Bryn Mawr College.</p><p>Ogden's interest in language and communication led him to develop Basic English, a simplified version of the English language that he hoped would become a global lingua franca. The language consisted of only 850 words, making it easy to learn and use for people from diverse linguistic backgrounds. Basic English was used during World War II by the US Army and later by the United Nations, but it never achieved widespread adoption.</p><p>Ogden's belief in the power of language to shape our understanding of the world led him to become involved in many social and political causes. He was a committed pacifist and a vocal critic of the British government's policies toward India. He also advocated for social and economic reforms, including the establishment of a universal basic income.</p><p>Despite his contributions to linguistics, philosophy, and other fields, Ogden's legacy remains somewhat overshadowed by the controversy surrounding his political views.

(December 14, 1866		London-September 9, 1934			London)


was
an English
art critic.


					</p><p>He was a key figure in the Bloomsbury Group, a collective of writers, artists, and intellectuals who were influential in the early 20th century. Fry was a champion of Post-Impressionist art and helped to bring the works of artists like Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne to a wider audience in Britain. He was also a painter himself and exhibited his work in several exhibitions, including the landmark 1910 exhibition "Manet and the Post-Impressionists" which he organized. Fry was a passionate advocate for modernism and helped to establish it as a legitimate art form in Britain. In addition to his work as an art critic, Fry was also a lecturer, a curator, and a teacher, and his ideas and influence are still felt in the world of art today.</p><p>Fry was educated at Cambridge University, where he studied science and philosophy before turning to art. He traveled extensively throughout his life, visiting cities like Paris, where he became enamored with the avant-garde art scene. Fry's writings on art were groundbreaking for their time and helped to establish him as a leading authority on the subject. He was a founding member of the Omega Workshops, an interior design and decorative arts company that aimed to bring contemporary design to a wider audience. Fry's distinctive style and taste helped to shape the look of British design in the early 20th century, and he was influential in the development of the Arts and Crafts movement. Fry's personal life was marked by tragedy - his wife Helen was mentally ill and ultimately committed suicide, and Fry struggled with depression throughout his life. Despite these challenges, Fry continued to produce important work and remains an important figure in the history of British art and design.</p><p>Additionally, Fry's impact on the art world extended beyond his own time. He played a significant role in the development of art history as a field, pioneering new approaches to the study of art and its cultural contexts. Fry's belief that art should be accessible to all, regardless of social or economic status, helped to democratize the art world and make it more inclusive. He believed that art had the power to transform society and create a more just and equitable world. Fry's legacy is still studied and debated by art historians and enthusiasts to this day, and his ideas continue to shape and influence the art world. In recognition of his achievements, Fry was awarded the Order of Merit by King George V in 1933, just one year before his death.</p><p></p><p>
