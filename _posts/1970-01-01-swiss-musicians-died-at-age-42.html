		a.k.a. Jorg Jenatsch

	
was
a Swiss
personality.


					</p><p>He is remembered for his role as a military leader during the Thirty Years’ War, which was a religious conflict that lasted from 1618 to 1648. Jenatsch led several successful campaigns against the Austrian Habsburgs who sought to expand their territory into the Swiss Confederacy. He was also a key figure in the political and religious movements that sought greater autonomy for the independent Swiss cantons.</p><p>In addition to his military and political activities, Jenatsch is known for his involvement in a notorious assassination. In 1626, he was accused of killing a prominent Calvinist minister, but the charges were later dropped. However, in 1637, Jenatsch was involved in the murder of an important rival, the politician Pompeius von Planta. This crime caused a scandal, and Jenatsch fled to France to avoid arrest. He later returned to Switzerland, where he was eventually caught and sentenced to death.</p><p>Despite his controversial reputation, Jenatsch is still regarded as a hero by some Swiss nationalists who celebrate his efforts to defend Swiss independence and resist foreign influence. A statue of him stands in the town of Samedan, his birthplace.</p><p></p><p>
