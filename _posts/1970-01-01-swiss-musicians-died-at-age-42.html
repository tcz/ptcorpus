(February 4, 1896		Vienna-December 8, 1938)


was
a Swiss
writer and novelist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his crime novels featuring the detective Sergeant Studer. His works have been translated into several languages, and his unique style and approach to crime fiction have earned him a loyal following among readers and critics alike. </p><p>Glauser had a troubled life and suffered from various addictions, including alcohol and drugs, as well as mental illness. He was institutionalized several times, and his struggles with these issues were reflected in his writing, which often dealt with social outcasts and marginal figures. Despite his personal difficulties, Glauser was a prolific writer, and his works were widely acclaimed for their vivid characters, powerful themes, and intricate plots.</p><p>Today, Glauser is considered one of the most important Swiss writers of the 20th century, and his legacy continues to inspire and influence writers, scholars, and readers around the world.</p><p>Born in Vienna, Glauser's family moved to Switzerland when he was a child. He served in World War I and suffered a head injury that would plague him for the rest of his life. After the war, he worked a variety of jobs, including as a laborer, waiter, and journalist. It wasn't until his thirties that he began to seriously pursue writing, and he quickly gained a reputation as a talented author.</p><p>While his crime novels featuring Sergeant Studer are his most well-known works, Glauser also wrote poetry and literary fiction. He was a member of the Dada movement and was influenced by the works of Franz Kafka and James Joyce. In addition to his struggles with addiction and mental illness, Glauser's personal life was fraught with difficulties, including a failed marriage and financial struggles.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Glauser wrote consistently throughout his life and produced a body of work that has stood the test of time. His depiction of the underbelly of Swiss society and his focus on marginal characters have led many to view him as a pioneer of Swiss crime fiction. Today, he is celebrated as one of Switzerland's most important literary figures.</p><p>Throughout his life, Friedrich Glauser struggled with addiction and mental illness, often spending time in hospitals and sanatoriums. He frequently used his own experiences as inspiration for his writing and was known for his unflinching portrayal of the darker aspects of human nature. His most famous work, the Sergeant Studer series, features a detective who is flawed and human, rather than a perfect hero. This approach was groundbreaking at the time, and helped to usher in a new era of crime fiction that focused on the psychology and motivations of criminals.</p><p>In addition to his literary accomplishments, Glauser was also involved in left-wing politics and was a supporter of the Communist Party. He was active in various workers' and artists' movements, and his writing often incorporated themes of social justice and inequality. Despite his political views, Glauser was able to achieve a certain level of recognition and success within Switzerland during his lifetime, and his works have since been widely translated and adapted for stage and screen.</p><p>Today, Friedrich Glauser's legacy continues to inspire writers and readers around the world. His innovative approach to crime fiction, combined with his deep understanding of the human condition, has cemented his place in literary history as one of Switzerland's greatest writers.</p><p></p><p>

		a.k.a. Jorg Jenatsch

	
was
a Swiss
personality.


					</p><p>He is remembered for his role as a military leader during the Thirty Years’ War, which was a religious conflict that lasted from 1618 to 1648. Jenatsch led several successful campaigns against the Austrian Habsburgs who sought to expand their territory into the Swiss Confederacy. He was also a key figure in the political and religious movements that sought greater autonomy for the independent Swiss cantons.</p><p>In addition to his military and political activities, Jenatsch is known for his involvement in a notorious assassination. In 1626, he was accused of killing a prominent Calvinist minister, but the charges were later dropped. However, in 1637, Jenatsch was involved in the murder of an important rival, the politician Pompeius von Planta. This crime caused a scandal, and Jenatsch fled to France to avoid arrest. He later returned to Switzerland, where he was eventually caught and sentenced to death.</p><p>Despite his controversial reputation, Jenatsch is still regarded as a hero by some Swiss nationalists who celebrate his efforts to defend Swiss independence and resist foreign influence. A statue of him stands in the town of Samedan, his birthplace.</p><p>Jörg Jenatsch was born into a prominent family in Samedan, Switzerland. He studied at the University of Basel before returning to his hometown to become a Protestant minister. However, he soon became involved in politics and military affairs, and he led a successful campaign against the Austrians in 1621. He also played a major role in negotiating the independence of the Swiss canton of Graubünden from Austria in 1621.</p><p>Jenatsch's political and religious beliefs were complex and often contradictory. He was a Calvinist, but he was also sympathetic to the Catholic cause and worked closely with Catholic leaders to achieve his political goals. He was a fierce defender of Swiss independence, but he also recognized the importance of forming alliances with foreign powers.</p><p>Jenatsch's involvement in the murder of Pompeius von Planta tarnished his reputation and legacy. Some historians believe that he was motivated by personal resentment rather than political or religious motives. Nevertheless, his military and political achievements continue to be celebrated in Switzerland, and he remains a controversial figure to this day.</p><p>Jörg Jenatsch was not only a military leader and politician, but he was also a writer and poet. He wrote several plays and poems in German and Latin, which reflected his political and religious beliefs. One of his most famous works is the play "Diotima", which tells the story of a woman who is unjustly accused of a crime and fought for her innocence.</p><p>In addition to his literary pursuits, Jenatsch was also known for his charisma and charm. He was a skilled negotiator and had a talent for building alliances and persuading people to support his cause. This helped him to become a influential figure in the political and military spheres of Switzerland during his time.</p><p>Despite his controversial actions, Jörg Jenatsch left a lasting impact on Swiss history. His defense of Swiss independence and his military and political achievements continue to be celebrated in Switzerland, and he is remembered as a complex and enigmatic figure who defied easy categorization.</p><p></p><p>
