						</p><p>Christoph Probst was a German student and anti-Nazi activist who played an active role in the White Rose resistance movement. Along with other members of the movement, such as Sophie Scholl and Hans Scholl, Probst advocated for the end of the Nazi regime and was involved in distributing leaflets and other oppositional materials across Germany. Probst was eventually arrested for his activities and was convicted of high treason by the Nazi regime. He was executed by guillotine at Stadelheim Prison in Munich at the age of 23. Despite his short life, Probst remains an inspiration to many for his bravery and dedication to the values of freedom and justice.</p><p>Probst was born into a Catholic family in Murnau, Germany. His father was a doctor and his mother was a homemaker. Probst was a bright student and attended the University of Munich to study medicine. However, after being drafted into the German army during World War II, Probst became disillusioned with the Nazi regime and began to sympathize with anti-Nazi movements.</p><p>Around this time, Probst became involved with the White Rose resistance group, which sought to overthrow the Nazi government through non-violent means. Probst helped to distribute anti-Nazi leaflets and agitated against the government in other ways. As a result, he was arrested by the Gestapo in February 1943 along with fellow White Rose members.</p><p>After being interrogated and subjected to torture, Probst was tried and sentenced to death for his involvement with the resistance. Despite being given the opportunity to renounce his beliefs, Probst refused and was executed by guillotine at Stadelheim Prison.</p><p>Probst's legacy has been celebrated in many ways, including through the creation of the Christoph Probst Foundation, which seeks to promote peace and democracy in Germany. Probst has been posthumously honored with numerous medals and awards for his bravery and commitment to the ideals of freedom and justice.</p><p>Probst's courage, along with that of the other members of the White Rose resistance, has had a lasting impact on Germany's post-war narrative. In later years, his story was taught in German schools as a shining example of resistance to tyranny and oppression. Probst's widow, Herta Dohrn Probst, continued to uphold his legacy by speaking out against fascism and right-wing extremism in Germany. Today, Probst is considered a national hero and is remembered as one of the martyrs of the German resistance. His life and legacy stand as an important reminder of the dangers of extremism and the importance of speaking out against injustice.</p><p>Despite his tragic death at a young age, Christoph Probst's legacy continues to inspire people around the world. In addition to the Christoph Probst Foundation, which was established by his family, several schools and streets have been named in his honor. Probst's story has also been the subject of several films, plays, and books, further immortalizing his bravery and dedication to the anti-Nazi cause.</p><p>Probst's wife Herta Dohrn Probst, who he married in 1942, went on to become a renowned German sculptor and worked tirelessly to keep the memory of her husband alive. Throughout her career, she created several sculptures dedicated to Probst and the White Rose resistance, including a memorial at the University of Munich where the group distributed their anti-Nazi materials.</p><p>The courage shown by Christop Probst and the other members of the White Rose resistance serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of speaking out against oppression and injustice, even in the face of danger. More than seven decades after his death, Probst's legacy continues to inspire and motivate people to fight for a better, more just world.</p><p></p><p>

was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>Hans Conrad Leipelt was a German member of the White Rose resistance movement against the Nazi regime during World War II. He was the only non-student member of the group and was a close friend of Sophie Scholl, one of the movement's leaders. Leipelt was arrested along with the other members of the White Rose in February 1943 and was sentenced to death by the Nazis. He was executed by guillotine in Munich's Stadelheim Prison on January 29, 1945, at the age of 23. Leipelt is remembered for his bravery and sacrifice in opposing the oppressive Nazi regime. He continues to be an inspiration to those who fight against oppression and discrimination.</p><p>Hans Conrad Leipelt's family moved from Vienna to Munich when he was a child. He grew up in a middle-class family and attended secondary school in Munich. After finishing school, he was drafted into the German military and sent to fight on the Eastern Front in 1941. However, he was discharged due to injuries and later began working as an apprentice at a furniture store.</p><p>It was during this time that he became involved with the White Rose resistance movement, which aimed to spread anti-Nazi propaganda and encourage civil disobedience against the regime. Leipelt was attracted to the group's ideals of freedom, justice, and human dignity, and he quickly became a committed member.</p><p>While the other members of the White Rose were students at the University of Munich, Leipelt was a non-student outsider who brought a unique perspective to the group. He worked closely with Sophie Scholl, one of the movement's leaders, in organizing and distributing pamphlets and flyers throughout Munich.</p><p>Leipelt's capture, trial, and execution were a devastating blow to the White Rose movement, but his bravery and dedication continue to inspire people all over the world. He is remembered as a hero who stood up for what was right, even in the face of extreme danger and oppression.</p><p>After his arrest and imprisonment, Leipelt remained resolute in his beliefs and did not betray his fellow members of the White Rose. He refused to reveal the names of his comrades and tried to protect his friends from harm. His steadfastness and loyalty in the face of torture and interrogation are a testament to his courage and moral fiber.</p><p>Leipelt's legacy has also been celebrated in various ways. In 1983, the German government issued a postage stamp honoring him and the other members of the White Rose. In 2003, a memorial plaque was installed at the place where he was arrested in Munich, and another one was erected at the Stadelheim Prison where he was executed. His life and actions have been the subject of numerous books, documentaries, and movies, including the 2005 film "Sophie Scholl: The Final Days."</p><p>In addition to his involvement with the White Rose movement, Hans Conrad Leipelt was also involved in other acts of resistance against the Nazi regime. He helped to hide Jewish friends and acquaintances from the authorities and was active in the underground railway, which aided people in escaping Nazi persecution. Leipelt's bravery and selflessness in risking his own safety to help others are a testament to his character and moral convictions.</p><p>Before his execution, Leipelt wrote a letter to his parents in which he expressed his belief that his actions were necessary to resist the evil of the Nazi regime. He wrote, "We have to stand up against the evil, no matter what the consequences might be. We cannot afford to sit idly by and watch the destruction of everything that is good and noble in our world."</p><p>Leipelt's life and legacy continue to inspire people today to stand up against oppression and discrimination. His courage in the face of overwhelming hardship and his unwavering commitment to justice are a lasting testament to the human spirit.</p><p></p><p>
