						</p><p>Gable was known for his rugged good looks and charismatic screen presence. He began his acting career on stage and in silent films, but it was his role as Rhett Butler in the 1939 epic "Gone with the Wind" that solidified his status as a Hollywood icon. Gable appeared in over 60 films throughout his career, including "It Happened One Night," "Mutiny on the Bounty," and "The Misfits." He was frequently paired on screen with leading ladies such as Greta Garbo, Marilyn Monroe, and Vivien Leigh. Gable was married five times, including to actress Carole Lombard until her death in a plane crash in 1942. He himself suffered a heart attack on November 6, 1960 and passed away ten days later at the age of 59.</p><p>Gable was also known for his service in the military during World War II. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1942 and served as a gunner on a B-17 Flying Fortress. Gable's service was seen as a morale booster for the American public, and he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal for his actions. After the war, he continued his acting career and also worked as a producer, forming his own production company, GABCO. Gable's legacy as a Hollywood legend has continued long after his death, and he is often cited as one of the greatest actors in the history of American cinema.</p><p>Gable was born in Cadiz, Ohio to William Henry Gable and Adeline Hershelman, and was the only child of the couple. His parents separated when he was young, and he was raised primarily by his mother. Gable's first job was in the oil fields, but he later moved to Akron, Ohio to work in a tire factory. It was during this time that he got his start in acting, joining a local theater group. He eventually made his way to Hollywood, where he landed small roles in films before catching his big break with "It Happened One Night." Gable's portrayal of a wisecracking, yet charming news reporter in the film earned him his first Academy Award for Best Actor. Gable's off-screen persona was just as legendary as his on-screen roles, with his affairs and romances with fellow actresses adding to his allure. Despite never receiving another Oscar, he continued to be a beloved and respected actor in Hollywood until his death in 1960.</p><p>Gable's iconic mustache became a trademark of his appearance and was even dubbed the "Gable mustache" by the press. He was also known for his love of cars and owned a collection of luxury vehicles. In addition to his Hollywood fame, Gable was also a skilled polo player, owning his own team, and was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed hunting and fishing. Gable's personal life was not without tragedy, as his third wife, the actress Carole Lombard, died in a plane crash in 1942 while returning from a war bond tour. Gable briefly returned to active duty in the military afterward but was eventually discharged due to his age. Despite the loss of Lombard and his own health struggles, Gable continued to work in Hollywood and remained a beloved figure until his untimely death in 1960.</p><p>Gable was also a pioneer in the use of method acting, which emphasizes the actor's emotional connection to their character. He studied with the legendary actor and acting teacher, Josephine Dillon, and later with the equally renowned teacher, Natasha Rambova. Through their guidance, Gable learned how to tap into his own emotions to create compelling and nuanced performances. Gable's dedication to his craft often led to clashes with directors and studio executives, but his reputation as a talented and committed actor helped him to weather these disputes. </p><p>Gable's legacy as a Hollywood icon has only grown over the years, with numerous books and documentaries exploring his life and career. He has been cited as an influence by countless actors, and his films continue to be screened and enjoyed by audiences around the world. Despite his success, Gable never forgot his roots in Ohio and remained a proud Midwesterner throughout his life. His enduring popularity is a testament to his talent and charisma, and his contributions to the world of film will continue to be celebrated for generations to come.</p><p></p><p>
