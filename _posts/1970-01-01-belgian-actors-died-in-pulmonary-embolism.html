							Brel is widely regarded as a master of the modern chanson, a French style of music characterized by its poetic lyrics and cabaret style. He rose to fame in the 1950s, with hits such as "Ne me quitte pas" ("Don't Leave Me"), "La chanson des vieux amants" ("The Song of Old Lovers") and "Le Moribond" ("The Dying Man"). His music was infused with deep emotion and social commentary, and he often tackled controversial topics such as death, love, sex, and politics.</p><p>In addition to his music career, Brel was also a celebrated actor, starring in several French films including "La Bande à Bonnot" and "Franz". He also directed and wrote the screenplay for the film "Franz".</p><p>Brel was known for his intense, often theatrical performances and his powerful baritone voice. Despite his international success, he remained a deeply private person and retired from performing in 1967 to focus on his family and writing. He later returned to the stage briefly in the 1970s before his untimely death from lung cancer at the age of 49. His legacy lives on, with many of his songs considered classics of French popular music.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=91751" title="Wikipedia article about Jacques Brel">Jacques Brel on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/swiss-musicians-died-at-age-61.html' title='Swiss musicians died at age 61'><strong>Swiss musicians died at age 61</strong> List of the top 8 Swiss music stars who died when they were 61</a></li><li><a href='/polish-actresses-died-at-age-77.html' title='Polish actresses died at age 77'><strong>Polish actresses died at age 77</strong> List of the top 3 Polish actresses who died when they were 77</a></li><li><a href='/hungarian-actors-died-in-1979.html' title='Hungarian actors died in 1979'><strong>Hungarian actors died in 1979</strong> List of the top 1 Hungarian actors who died in 1979</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/canadian-musicians-died-in-stroke.html' title='Canadian musicians died in Stroke'><strong>Canadian musicians died in Stroke</strong> List of the top 9 Canadian music stars who died in Stroke</a></li><li><a href='/american-musicians-died-in-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis.html' title='American musicians died in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'><strong>American musicians died in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</strong> List of the top 7 American music stars who died in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></li><li><a href='/finnish-actors-born-in-1921.html' title='Finnish actors born in 1921'><strong>Finnish actors born in 1921</strong> List of the top 5 Finnish actors who were born in 1921</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
