		also known as Dr. Carl Hellmuth Hertz

	
was
a Swedish
physician.


					</p><p>He was born in Berlin, Germany in 1915 and grew up in a family of scientists. Hertz moved to Sweden with his family in 1933 and began studying medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. After completing his studies, he worked as a physician and research scientist at several hospitals and institutions.</p><p>Hertz was known for his pioneering work in the field of neonatal medicine, specifically in the care of premature infants. He developed new techniques for providing respiratory support to premature babies, which helped to prevent blindness and brain damage in these vulnerable patients. Hertz also conducted important research on the effects of oxygen on premature infants, which led to significant changes in the way these infants are treated today.</p><p>In addition to his work in neonatal medicine, Hertz also made significant contributions to the field of medical education. He was a professor of pediatrics at the Karolinska Institute and mentored many young physicians and researchers throughout his career.</p><p>Hertz received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to medicine, including the Max Planck Medal and the Avery Prize in Neonatology. He died in Stockholm, Sweden in 1990 at the age of 75.</p><p>Hertz was also an avid photographer and documented his travels extensively through his photographs. He had a great appreciation for art and often visited museums and galleries in his free time. Additionally, Hertz was an active member of several medical organizations, including the Swedish Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. He authored over 100 publications throughout his career, including several textbooks and articles that are considered seminal works in the field of neonatal medicine. Hertz's legacy lives on through the countless premature babies whose lives have been saved by his groundbreaking research and through the generations of physicians that he mentored and inspired.</p><p>Hertz's impact on neonatal care extends far beyond his lifetime, with his techniques for respiratory support and management of oxygen levels in premature infants still used today. In fact, his work laid the groundwork for modern neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) around the world. Beyond his academic and medical contributions, Hertz was also known for his kindness and dedication to his patients. He is remembered by colleagues and friends as a humble and thoughtful physician, always eager to learn and improve the care he provided. Hertz's passion for photography and art was also evident in his medical work, as he often incorporated visual elements into his research and teaching materials. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of physicians and researchers in neonatal medicine and beyond.</p><p>Hertz's impact on neonatal medicine is further evident in his development of the Hertz Respirator, a device used to provide continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to premature infants. This device was instrumental in improving the survival rates of premature infants and reducing the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. Hertz was also a key player in the establishment of the Swedish Neonatal Society, which aimed to promote the care of premature infants in Sweden.Beyond his medical and academic contributions, Hertz was also a dedicated family man. He had three children with his wife, Marianne Gran Hertz, and was known for his love of nature and the outdoors. Hertz spent much of his free time exploring the forests and lakes of Sweden and was an avid gardener. He often shared his love of nature with his children and grandchildren, taking them on frequent camping and hiking trips.Hertz's legacy continues to be celebrated today through the Carl Hellmuth Hertz Lecture, an annual lecture series at Karolinska Institute focused on neonatal medicine. The lecture series showcases the latest research in the field and honors Hertz's pioneering work in neonatal care.</p><p></p><p>
