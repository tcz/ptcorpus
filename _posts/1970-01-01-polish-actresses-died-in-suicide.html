						</p><p>Pola Nirenska was born in Warsaw in 1910 into a family of actors and musicians.

She was particularly inspired by the work of French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whose writings on phenomenology influenced her choreography. Nirenska's dances were performed in the United States and Europe, and she received numerous awards for her contributions to dance and theater.</p><p>In addition to her work as a dancer and choreographer, Nirenska was also an accomplished actor, appearing in several films and theatrical productions throughout her career.

She often incorporated multimedia elements into her performances, such as film and spoken word, to create a multidimensional experience for her audiences. Nirenska was also actively involved in numerous organizations dedicated to the advancement of dance, including the American Dance Guild and the Dance Notation Bureau. </p><p>In addition to her dance and theater work, Nirenska was an accomplished writer and published several essays and articles on dance theory and history. She also wrote a memoir, "The Warsaw Ghetto: A Diary," which chronicled her experiences escaping the Nazi occupation of Poland during World War II. </p><p>Nirenska's legacy continues to influence the world of dance and theater today. Her work inspired countless dancers and choreographers and her contributions to the field have been recognized by numerous awards and honors, including a National Endowment for the Arts Choreographer's Fellowship in 1979.
