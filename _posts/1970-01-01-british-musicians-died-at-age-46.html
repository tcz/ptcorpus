(December 13, 1890		Poole-March 5, 1937)


was
a British
writer, novelist and author.


					</p><p>She was a prominent figure in the literary circles during the 1920s and 1930s and was known for her experimental writing style that often combined elements of modernism, mysticism, and spirituality. Butts was a close friend of several influential writers of her time, including D.H. Lawrence, Ezra Pound, and T.S. Eliot. She published several novels and short stories, including her most well-known work, "Armed With Madness," which was based on her own experiences during World War I. In addition to writing, Butts was also an accomplished occultist and spent a great deal of time exploring various spiritual and mystical practices. She died at the age of 46 after a long battle with cancer. Despite her relatively short life and career, Butts has continued to be celebrated as an important and innovative writer in the years since her death.</p><p>Born into an affluent family, Butts was educated at home by her mother and later attended Oxford University. She married a fellow writer, John Rodker, in 1919, but the marriage was short-lived and ended in divorce in 1923. Butts struggled with her health and personal life throughout her writing career, but continued to produce works that were well-received by critics and readers alike.</p><p>One of Butts' distinguishing features was her interest in the occult, which she incorporated into her writing in unique and complex ways. She was a member of several esoteric societies and believed in the power of spiritual and mystical practices to connect with the divine. This interest in the supernatural also played a role in her personal life, as she was known to conduct s√©ances and communicate with spirits.</p><p>Despite her contributions to British literature, Butts was largely forgotten in the years following her death. It wasn't until the late 20th century that her work began to be re-evaluated and appreciated by a new generation of readers and critics. Today, Butts is considered an important figure in the modernist literary movement and is celebrated for her unique style and mystical explorations.</p><p></p><p>

(August 16, 1888		Tremadog-May 19, 1935			Bovington Camp)

	
		also known as Lawrence of Arabia, Thomas Edward Lawrence, Aircraftsman Ross, Aircraftsman Shaw, Thomas E. Lawrence, Ned, Thomas Edward Lawrence, CB, DSO, John Hume Ross, Thomas Edward Shaw or T.E. Lawrence

	
was
a British
writer and military officer.


					</p><p>Lawrence achieved fame for his role as a liaison officer during the Arab Revolt of 1916-1918 against the Ottoman Empire. He was instrumental in leading Arab forces in a successful guerilla campaign against the Ottomans, and his expertise in desert warfare was legendary. Lawrence's work on the revolt was chronicled in his classic book, "Seven Pillars of Wisdom." Following the revolt, he served as an advisor to Winston Churchill and the British government, and also played a key role in the negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I. In later years, Lawrence was involved in various political causes and continued to write about his experiences in the Middle East. Despite his legendary status, Lawrence struggled with personal demons throughout his life and died at the age of 46 in a motorcycle accident.</p><p>Lawrence was born in Tremadog, Wales and grew up in Oxford, England. He studied history and archaeology at Oxford University and spent time traveling and learning about different cultures before the outbreak of World War I. Lawrence's fluency in Arabic and knowledge of the Middle East made him a valuable asset to the British military during the war, and his leadership during the Arab Revolt earned him widespread admiration.</p><p>After the war, Lawrence struggled to adjust to civilian life and joined the Royal Air Force under an assumed name. He continued to write and was offered a knighthood, which he declined. Lawrence's death in 1935 was a major loss to the literary and military worlds, but his legacy lived on through his writing and his role in Middle Eastern history. Today, Lawrence is still regarded as a key figure in the Arab Revolt and a symbol of British heroism and imperialism.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by motorcycle accident.

(October 1, 1630		London-May 4, 1677			London)


was
a British
mathematician.


					</p><p>Isaac Barrow was a prominent figure of the 17th century in the field of mathematics. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he eventually became a professor of mathematics. He was a contemporary of Sir Isaac Newton, and the two were great friends. Barrow is perhaps best known for his work on calculus, and he is credited with discovering the fundamental theorem of calculus.</p><p>Barrow was also an influential theologian and was known for his sermons, which were both eloquent and insightful. He was a strong believer in the importance of morality and ethics and sought to teach these values through his lecturing and writing.</p><p>In addition to his academic and religious pursuits, Barrow was also an accomplished linguist, fluent in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic. He was a member of the Royal Society and was honored by the society with their first gold medal in recognition of his contributions to mathematics.</p><p>Although he died young, at the age of 46, Barrow left behind a tremendous legacy. He influenced many great mathematicians and scientists, including Isaac Newton, who once described Barrow as a "master of geometry."</p><p>Barrow was born in London in 1630 to a family of modest means, and his father was a linen-draper. He attended Charterhouse School before studying at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he excelled in his studies. After completing his bachelor's degree, Barrow became a fellow of the college and took up a teaching position there. However, he soon left Cambridge and spent several years travelling throughout Europe, studying mathematics under some of the best teachers of the time.</p><p>Upon his return to Cambridge, Barrow was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, a position Sir Isaac Newton would later hold. Barrow's most significant contribution to mathematics was his work on the calculus of infinitesimals, in which he laid the groundwork for later developments by Newton and Leibniz.</p><p>Barrow was also a prolific writer and produced works on subjects ranging from ancient history to theology. His theological writings were highly regarded, and he was offered several positions in the Church, including that of the Bishop of Rochester, which he declined.</p><p>Barrow's influence on Newton was significant, and he played a crucial role in laying the foundation for Newton's later work. Newton acknowledged Barrow's contributions by dedicating his famous work, Principia Mathematica, to him.</p><p>Barrow died in 1677, at the age of 46, from an illness. Though he did not live to see the full extent of his impact on mathematics, his work and influence continued to be felt long after his death.</p><p></p><p>

(August 18, 1685		Municipal Borough of Edmonton-November 30, 1731			London)


was
a British
mathematician.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work on what is now called Taylor's theorem, which provides a way to represent functions as infinite series. Taylor also made contributions to the field of calculus, developing techniques for evaluating integrals and solving differential equations. In addition to his mathematical work, he was also a member of the Royal Society and served in the British Parliament. Taylor's legacy has continued to influence mathematics and other fields, with his name now attached to various concepts and theorems.</p><p>Taylor was born into a family of wealthy merchants and was one of five children. He showed an early aptitude for mathematics and was privately tutored before studying at St John's College, Cambridge. He later traveled abroad to study in France and Italy, where he met the prominent mathematicians of his time. Taylor's contributions to mathematics were not limited to his work on calculus; he also wrote about optics, sound, and music theory. His interest in music led him to develop a theoretical explanation for the phenomenon of sympathetic vibrations. Taylor's work has been praised for its elegance and rigor, and he is considered one of the most important mathematicians of the 18th century. His legacy has continued to inspire researchers in fields ranging from mathematics to physics and engineering.</p><p></p><p>
