politician and samurai.


					</p><p>Toshimichi is best known for his crucial role in the Meiji Restoration - a period in Japan's history when the country transitioned from a feudal shogunate to a modern nation-state. As one of the Three Great Nobles who spearheaded the movement, Toshimichi played a significant role in implementing westernization policies such as abolishing the feudal system and establishing a modern educational system. Prior to his political career, Toshimichi trained as a samurai under the Shimazu clan, and he was highly respected for his military knowledge and experience. In addition to politics, he also made significant contributions to the economic development of Japan. Despite his accomplishments, Toshimichi was assassinated by an extremist in 1878 at the age of 47. He is still revered as a national hero and a key figure in Japan's modernization.</p><p>Toshimichi was born in Kagoshima to a family of lower samurai rank. He was educated in both Japanese and Dutch, which influenced his later work in modernizing Japan. In 1866, he was appointed governor of Hyōgo Prefecture, where he was involved in developing infrastructure and establishing a modern legal system. </p><p>During the Boshin War, Toshimichi helped to establish a coalition between the Satsuma and Chōshū domains, which led to the downfall of the Tokugawa shogunate. He also played a significant role in negotiating the end of Japan's isolationist policies and establishing trade agreements with Western countries. </p><p>As a politician, Toshimichi was known for his strong leadership and commitment to modernizing Japan. He was involved in the establishment of the Meiji Constitution, which transformed Japan into a constitutional monarchy. </p><p>Toshimichi's legacy is still celebrated in Japan today, with statues and memorials dedicated to him throughout the country. He is considered one of the most important figures in the country's modern history and is often referred to as the "father of modern Japanese politics."</p><p>Toshimichi began his political career in 1869 when he was appointed to the Daijō-kan, the highest council of the Imperial Court. He held important positions such as Minister of Finance and Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, where he implemented policies to develop the country's economy. Toshimichi is credited with establishing Japan's first national bank and introducing the country's first modern currency system. He also played an instrumental role in the development of Japan's first railroad network and transforming the country's agricultural practices.</p><p>Toshimichi's contributions extended beyond politics and economics. He was passionate about education and believed that a modern, western-style education system was crucial to Japan's success. He worked towards establishing schools and universities based on this belief and played a significant role in the establishment of Tokyo Imperial University, Japan's first national university. Toshimichi was a strong advocate for gender equality in education and pushed for the establishment of schools for women.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Toshimichi's political career was not without controversy. He was known for his strict policies and authoritarian leadership style which earned him the nickname, "Devil of the Restoration." He also faced criticism for his handling of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877, and his decision to suppress the revolt is still debated by historians.</p><p>Regardless of his shortcomings, Toshimichi's contributions to Japan's modernization cannot be overstated. His vision and leadership paved the way for Japan's rise as a major world power in the 20th century. Today, he is remembered as one of Japan's greatest statesmen and a symbol of the country's impressive transformation from a feudal society to a modern, industrialized nation.</p><p></p><p>
