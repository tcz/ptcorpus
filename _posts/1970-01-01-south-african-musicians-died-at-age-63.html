					</p><p>He was mostly known for his unusual height, measured at 7 feet 6 inches, which made him one of the tallest men in the world during his time. Mitchell traveled extensively as a professional wrestler, where he was billed as the "Kentucky Giant", and gained significant popularity for his impressive physique and strength. In 1901, he was hired by the famous Barnum and Bailey Circus as one of its star attractions. After retiring from wrestling, Mitchell became a pub landlord, initially in London and later in his hometown of Market Weighton. Despite his remarkable height, Mitchell lived a relatively quiet life and was known for his friendly personality and kindheartedness towards children.</p><p>Mitchell's size was attributed to both gigantism and acromegaly, a hormonal disorder that causes abnormal growth of the bones. Although his condition helped him gain fame and fortune, it also caused him significant physical discomfort and health problems in his later years. Mitchell suffered from heart disease and was also blind in one eye due to a boxing injury sustained early in his career. Despite these setbacks, Mitchell remained active and continued to enjoy life until his sudden death in 1935, which was attributed to a heart attack. He was buried in Market Weighton cemetery and to this day remains a beloved figure in the town's history.</p><p>Mitchell was born in England but spent most of his life in South Africa, where he worked as a miner before pursuing a career in wrestling. He gained fame for his battles against other giant wrestlers, including the famous Maurice Tillet, who was also known as the "French Angel". Mitchell's wrestling career took him all over the world, from the United States to Australia, and he was known for his impressive strength and agility despite his massive size.</p><p>In addition to his wrestling career, Mitchell was also a talented musician and played several instruments, including the piano and accordion. He often entertained guests at his pub with his musical performances.</p><p>Despite his larger-than-life persona, Mitchell was described as a gentle and kind-hearted man who enjoyed spending time with children and animals. He was also a devoted husband to his wife, Ada, whom he married in 1918.</p><p>Today, Mitchell is remembered as an icon of his era and an inspiration to those who overcome physical challenges to achieve greatness. His legacy lives on through his appearances in popular culture, including references in books, films, and television shows.</p><p>Mitchell's legacy also extends to his impact on the world of professional wrestling. He was one of the first giants to gain worldwide fame and helped pave the way for future wrestlers of similar stature. His battles with other giant wrestlers are still remembered today as some of the most iconic matches in wrestling history. In 2014, Mitchell was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame, cementing his legacy as one of the greatest wrestling icons of all time.</p><p>Furthermore, Mitchell's height and physical appearance were also the subject of scientific study. After his death, his body was donated to science and analyzed by several researchers. Medical experts were fascinated by his size and sought to understand the underlying causes of his gigantism and acromegaly. Mitchell's legacy lives on not only through his impact on popular culture and wrestling but also through his contributions to medical science.</p><p></p><p>

His efforts helped to establish Afrikaans as a legitimate language of scholarship and literature, and today, it is the third-most-spoken language in South Africa.</p><p>Despite his popular appeal among Afrikaners, du Toit's legacy has been complicated by his involvement in the Afrikaner Bond, which has been criticized for promoting white supremacy and segregation.

It was erected in honor of his contributions to the development of the Afrikaans language and serves as a symbol of Afrikaner culture and identity.</p><p>Du Toit's advocacy for Afrikaner language and culture also played a significant role in the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910. He was instrumental in securing language rights for Afrikaans speakers in the new government, helping to ensure that Afrikaans would be recognized as an official language alongside English. Du Toit's legacy continues to influence the Afrikaner community, as well as academic and cultural institutions throughout South Africa. In recognition of his contributions to Afrikaans language and culture, several universities and institutions in South Africa have named buildings, scholarships, and awards in his honor.
