						</p><p>Pol Pot was the prime minister of Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. He was the leader of the Khmer Rouge regime which aimed to establish a communist peasant farming society. During his regime, an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians died as a result of forced labor, torture, starvation, or execution. </p><p>Pol Pot was born into a relatively wealthy farming family and later traveled to France to pursue his education. He was heavily influenced by Marxist philosophy and rebelled against the French colonial rule. In the 1960s, he formed the Communist Party of Kampuchea and began a guerrilla war against the government.</p><p>After the Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975, Pol Pot implemented radical policies that included the forced evacuation of people from cities, abolishment of religion, and the execution of people deemed enemies of the state. The regime was overthrown in 1979 and Pol Pot fled to the jungle. He continued to lead the Khmer Rouge until the 1990s, when he was arrested by his own followers and placed under house arrest. </p><p>Pol Pot died in 1998 while still under house arrest. Despite his crimes against humanity, Pol Pot remains a controversial figure, with some people idolizing him for his nationalist and anti-colonialist views.
