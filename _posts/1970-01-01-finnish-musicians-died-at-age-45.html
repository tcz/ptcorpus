(July 17, 1883		Helsinki-November 18, 1928			Stockholm)

	
		also known as Moshe Stiller, Mauritz Rellits or Mosje

	
was
a Finnish
film director, screenwriter and actor.


					</p><p>He began his career in theater before transitioning to films, and is perhaps best known for his work in the Swedish film industry during the silent era. Stiller is credited with discovering and helping launch the careers of Greta Garbo and Lars Hanson. He directed several films with Garbo, including "Gösta Berling's Saga" and "The Divine Woman". However, Stiller's own career was cut short when he died at the young age of 45 from pneumonia. Despite his short career, he is remembered as a pioneer in early Swedish cinema and for his influential work in shaping the careers of two of Hollywood's greatest stars.</p><p>In addition to his work in cinema, Stiller was also a talented writer and published several novels. He was known for his visual style and his ability to create emotionally powerful scenes on screen. Stiller's early life was marked by tragedy - his mother passed away when he was just six years old, and his father later committed suicide. Despite these challenges, he was able to rise to great heights in his career and became one of the most influential filmmakers of his time. Today, he is remembered as a key figure in the history of Swedish cinema and a pioneer in the development of the art form.</p><p>Stiller worked in both Finland and Sweden before eventually settling in Stockholm to focus on his burgeoning film career. He directed over twenty films in total, many of which are now considered classics of early Swedish cinema. Stiller's work was characterized by its attention to detail and his ability to create complex characters that resonated with audiences. Despite the success he enjoyed during his lifetime, Stiller's legacy was largely forgotten after his death. It wasn't until many years later that he was rediscovered by film historians and recognized for his contributions to the art form. Today, Mauritz Stiller is remembered as an innovator, a visionary, and a true pioneer of Swedish cinema. His work continues to inspire and captivate audiences around the world.</p><p>Stiller's influence on Swedish cinema extended far beyond his work as a director. He was also instrumental in developing the Swedish film industry as a whole, advocating for higher production values and encouraging greater collaboration between filmmakers and other artists. He was a mentor to many young filmmakers and actors, and his ideas helped shape the way Swedish cinema evolved in the years after his death. </p><p>In addition to his work with Garbo and Hanson, Stiller also directed several other notable actors, including Ingrid Bergman and Lars Ekborg. His films were marked by their lush, expressive visuals and their emphasis on character-driven storytelling. Despite his early death, Stiller's legacy lives on through his pioneering work and the influence he had on generations of filmmakers who came after him.</p><p>Stiller was born in Helsinki, Finland to Jewish parents who were both actors. He grew up in poverty after his father's suicide and was forced to leave school at an early age to work and support his family. Stiller's first love was theater, and he began his career as an actor before transitioning to directing. He worked in several theaters in Helsinki before moving to Sweden in 1912 to join the Svenska Biografteatern studio. Stiller quickly established himself as a talented director and was given creative control over his projects, which was rare at the time.</p><p>Stiller's breakthrough film came in 1916 with "The Gardener," which was a critical and commercial success. The film was noted for its naturalistic performances and realistic portrayal of everyday life, which set it apart from the melodramas that were popular at the time. Stiller continued to push the boundaries of Swedish cinema with films like "Erotikon" and "Sir Arne's Treasure," which experimented with visual and narrative techniques that were ahead of their time.</p><p>Stiller's contribution to Swedish cinema was cut short with his untimely death in 1928. However, his influence on the industry was felt for years to come. Many of his films were remade and adapted into other languages, and his visual style and storytelling techniques inspired generations of filmmakers. In 2018, the Finnish Film Foundation published a biography on Stiller, which highlighted his contributions to the art form and his impact on Swedish and Finnish cinema.</p><p></p><p>
