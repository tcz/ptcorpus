(June 29, 1754-August 27, 1803)


was
a Swedish
physician.


					</p><p>He was born in Stockholm, Sweden and obtained his medical degree from Uppsala University. Tengmalm was a prominent figure in the field of public health and epidemiology during the late 18th century. He is most well-known for his pioneering work on the prison system and his contributions to the understanding of infectious diseases, particularly during times of epidemic outbreaks. Tengmalm also made significant contributions to the history of medicine and authored several publications on the subject. He died in Stockholm at the age of 49.</p><p>Tengmalm's interest in public health extended beyond the prison system. He was an advocate for vaccination against smallpox and played a role in its implementation in Sweden. Tengmalm also contributed to the development of quarantine measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.</p><p>In addition to his medical career, Tengmalm was a founding member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences and served on numerous committees and commissions related to health and medicine. He was also a noted botanist and zoologist, with a particular interest in ornithology. Tengmalm is commemorated in the scientific names of several animal species, including the Tengmalm's owl and the Tengmalmsnäcka sea snail.</p><p>Tengmalm's early years were marked by tragedy as his family lost several members to disease outbreaks. These experiences likely shaped his interest in public health and his dedication to preventing similar tragedies in the future. </p><p>His work on the prison system was groundbreaking for its time. Tengmalm recognized the dire conditions in which prisoners were kept and advocated for improvements in sanitation, hygiene, and medical care. He also recommended that prisoners be separated by gender and age to prevent the spread of disease. His ideas were often met with resistance, but Tengmalm persisted in his efforts to improve prison conditions.</p><p>Tengmalm's contributions to the study of infectious diseases were also significant. He conducted research on the epidemiology of diseases such as cholera and tuberculosis, and was one of the first to suggest that epidemic diseases could be transmitted through water and air. His insights helped lay the groundwork for modern epidemiology and public health practices.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Tengmalm's life was cut short by tuberculosis, a disease that he had spent much of his career studying. He was just 49 years old at the time of his death, but his legacy lived on through his contributions to public health, medicine, and science.</p><p></p><p>
