(January 10, 1859		Płock-May 17, 1936			London)


was
a Polish
writer and journalist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his work as a leader of the Zionist movement, advocating for the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. Sokolow played a key role in the establishment of the World Zionist Organization and was the organization's first president from 1921-1931.</p><p>Aside from his political involvement, Sokolow was a prolific writer and editor. He founded and edited several newspapers and wrote numerous books on Jewish history and culture. Sokolow also served as a delegate to the Paris Peace Conference after World War I, advocating for the rights of Jews in the Middle East and promoting the Zionist cause to world leaders.</p><p>He is remembered as a passionate advocate for the Jewish people and their right to a homeland, and his efforts helped pave the way for the establishment of the modern state of Israel.</p><p>During his lifetime, Nahum Sokolow was honored for his work and contributions to the Jewish community. In 1925, he was awarded the Bialik Prize for Jewish literature, and in 1930 he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize (along with Jewish-American leader, Bernard Baruch) for his work in promoting international understanding and cooperation. Sokolow was also a polyglot, fluent in 11 languages, which allowed him to communicate with a wide range of people from different countries and cultures. His legacy continues to inspire and motivate those who work towards advancing the Zionist cause and promoting Jewish rights worldwide.</p><p>Sokolow was born into a Jewish family in Płock, which at that time was part of the Russian Empire. His father was a rabbi and a writer, and his mother was well-educated and encouraged her son's studies. Sokolow showed an early talent for languages, which he developed through his studies at local schools and later at universities in Warsaw and Berlin.</p><p>In 1882, Sokolow became involved in the Hibbat Zion movement, which advocated for the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. He helped to found the Hebrew language newspaper Ha-Zefirah, which became one of the leading voices of the Zionist movement. In 1897, Sokolow attended the First Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland, which marked the beginning of organized political Zionism. He played a key role in the congress and the subsequent establishment of the World Zionist Organization, which became the central body of the Zionist movement.</p><p>Over the next several decades, Sokolow traveled extensively throughout Europe and the Middle East, advocating for the Zionist cause and meeting with world leaders to promote Jewish rights. He was a skilled orator and writer and his speeches and articles were widely read and influential. In 1920, Sokolow was elected as the first president of the World Zionist Organization, a position he held for 11 years.</p><p>Sokolow's contributions to the Zionist movement and Jewish culture were widely recognized during his lifetime.

After his death in 1936, his legacy continued to be celebrated by the Jewish community and his writings and speeches remain important sources of inspiration for those who seek to promote Jewish rights and the Zionist cause.</p><p>Sokolow's advocacy for the Zionist cause was not without controversy. He faced criticism from some within the Jewish community who believed that a Jewish homeland should be pursued through peaceful means and without relying on Western powers for support. Sokolow argued that political action was necessary to achieve Zionist goals and that the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine would require the support of the international community.</p><p>Despite facing opposition, Sokolow remained steadfast in his commitment to the Zionist cause. He believed that a Jewish state was not only necessary for the safety and security of the Jewish people, but also for the preservation of Jewish culture and heritage. Through his writing, speaking, and organizing, Sokolow helped to lay the groundwork for the establishment of the modern state of Israel and to inspire generations of Jewish leaders and activists.</p><p>Today, Sokolow is remembered as a visionary leader and a tireless advocate for the Jewish people. His contributions to the Zionist movement and to Jewish literature and culture continue to inspire people around the world to stand up for their rights and to work towards a better future for their communities.</p><p>In addition to his work as a Zionist leader and writer, Nahum Sokolow was also involved in philanthropy and Jewish education. He helped to establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and served as its first president from 1925-1931. Sokolow also founded the Jewish Agency for Israel, which became an important organization for Jewish immigration to Palestine and the development of the Jewish state. He believed strongly in the importance of education in the preservation of Jewish culture and heritage.</p><p>Sokolow was also a prominent figure in interfaith dialogue, working to promote understanding and cooperation between Jews and Christians. He met with several prominent Christian leaders and advocated for mutual respect and tolerance between the two communities.</p><p>Despite facing many challenges and setbacks in his work for the Zionist cause, Sokolow remained optimistic and dedicated throughout his life. He once wrote, "Zionism is not a faith, but a battle for faith. It is not a hope, but a victory in hope. It is not a prayer, but a production of prayer."</p><p>Nahum Sokolow's impact on Jewish history and culture cannot be overstated. His vision and dedication helped pave the way for the establishment of the modern state of Israel, and his legacy of advocacy for Jewish rights continues to inspire people around the world today.</p><p></p><p>

(February 6, 1905		Krosno-September 1, 1982			Konstancin-Jeziorna)

	
		also known as Wladyslaw Gomulka

	
was
a Polish
politician.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Ryszard Strzelecki-Gomulka.

						</p><p>Władysław Gomułka was one of the key figures in the Polish Communist Party, having served as the First Secretary of the party in the 1950s and 60s. He played a crucial role in the events leading up to the 1956 Polish October and the subsequent liberalization of Poland's political and economic systems. Under Gomułka's leadership, the government initiated a series of reforms aimed at improving living standards, increasing political participation, and reducing the power of the secret police. However, he was also responsible for suppressing dissent and enforcing strict censorship measures, particularly in the aftermath of the Prague Spring in 1968. Despite these contradictions, Gomułka remains an important figure in the history of modern Poland and its transition to democracy.</p><p>After serving as the First Secretary of the Polish Communist Party, Gomułka also became the Prime Minister of Poland and later assumed the position of the President of the State Council, making him the highest-ranking politician in the country. During his tenure, he pursued a policy of "national communism," emphasizing the importance of Poland's national identity and historical traditions within a socialist framework.</p><p>In addition to his political career, Gomułka was also an active member of the Polish resistance during World War II, participating in underground activities against the Nazi occupation. He was imprisoned for his activities in 1936 and again in 1939, but eventually escaped and joined the Polish Army in France.</p><p>Gomułka's legacy is still debated in Poland today, with some viewing him as a pragmatic reformer who helped modernize the country and others condemning him for his authoritarian tendencies and repression of political dissent. Regardless of one's opinions on his rule, it is clear that Gomułka played a significant role in shaping post-war Poland and its relations with the Soviet Union.</p><p>Throughout his life, Władysław Gomułka was an ardent advocate of socialism and communism, and his political views were shaped by his experiences growing up in a working-class family in pre-World War I Poland. As a young man, he joined the Communist Party of Poland and became involved in various underground political activities. During World War II, he fought against the Nazis as a member of the Polish resistance and was imprisoned and later exiled for his activities.</p><p>After the war, Gomułka rose through the ranks of the Polish Communist Party, eventually becoming its First Secretary in 1956. His reforms during this period included liberalizing the economy, loosening censorship laws, and reducing the power of the secret police. Despite these efforts, Gomułka's rule was marked by ongoing political repression and suppression of dissent, particularly during the 1968 period of political upheaval known as the "Prague Spring."</p><p>In 1970, a wave of protests against Gomułka's economic policies led to violent clashes between protesters and police in several Polish cities, resulting in dozens of deaths. Gomułka was forced to resign as First Secretary, although he remained active in Polish politics for several more years.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Gomułka's impact on Polish history cannot be denied. His reforms in the 1950s and early 1960s helped to modernize the country and pave the way for its eventual transition to democracy. At the same time, his authoritarian tendencies and use of force to suppress dissent remain a subject of ongoing debate among historians and political analysts.</p><p>After his resignation as First Secretary in 1970, Gomułka remained active in politics, serving as a member of the Polish parliament until his death. He continued to advocate for socialism and communism, but also expressed regret for some of the more repressive aspects of his rule. Gomułka's personal life was marked by tragedy as well, as his son Ryszard was killed in a car accident in 1973.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Gomułka is remembered as one of the most influential figures in post-war Polish history. His policies helped to modernize the country and improve the standard of living for many Poles, while also laying the groundwork for the eventual collapse of communism in Poland and across Eastern Europe. Gomułka remains a significant figure in the ongoing debates about Polish identity and political ideology, and his complex legacy continues to shape political discourse in Poland to this day.</p><p>In addition to his political activities, Władysław Gomułka was also a prolific writer and intellectual. He wrote extensively on political theory, socialist ideology, and the history of Poland, and his writings were widely read and studied in Poland and throughout the socialist world. Gomułka was also an accomplished orator, and his speeches were known for their fiery rhetoric and commanding presence.</p><p>Despite his reputation as a hardliner within the Polish Communist Party, Gomułka was known for his independent streak and his willingness to challenge the Soviet Union on a number of issues. He was a strong advocate for Polish sovereignty and national identity, and he worked tirelessly to promote Poland's interests within the socialist bloc.</p><p>Gomułka's legacy is still the subject of intense debate in Poland today, with some viewing him as a hero of the socialist cause and others regarding him as a tyrant who repressed dissent and stifled democracy. Regardless of one's views on his rule, however, it is clear that Gomułka played a key role in shaping the political and economic landscape of post-war Poland, and his contributions to the country's history are both complex and far-reaching.</p><p></p><p>

He believed that objects, whether they be works of art or everyday objects, have a "constitutive essence" that is created by the way in which they are perceived by the human mind. This idea was further developed in his work on ontology, where he explored the nature of being and existence. </p><p>In addition to his academic work, Ingarden was also involved in Polish cultural life, serving as a founding member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and as the director of the National Museum in Krakow.

His emphasis on the role of perception and consciousness in the creation of meaning resonated with existentialist thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger. Ingarden's ontology, which focused on the individual's relationship to the world, was also influential in the development of existentialist philosophy.</p><p>Throughout his career, Ingarden remained committed to the ideals of humanism, emphasizing the importance of ethical values and human dignity. He was a strong advocate for democracy and human rights and was recognized for his contributions to Polish culture with several awards and honors.

His mother was a teacher, while his father was a lawyer and a professor of civil law. Ingarden was a gifted student from a young age, and he showed an early interest in philosophy. He was particularly drawn to the works of Edmund Husserl, who developed the philosophy of phenomenology. After completing his studies at the University of Krakow, he began his academic career as a professor of philosophy.</p><p>During his career, Ingarden developed a unique approach to ontology that emphasized the role of the individual in the creation of meaning. He believed that objects were not passive entities that existed independently of human experience, but rather were actively constituted by the way in which they were perceived by the human mind. This idea had a significant impact on the field of aesthetics, and his work on the nature of the literary work of art was particularly influential.</p><p>Although Ingarden was primarily an academic philosopher, he was also involved in the social and cultural life of Poland. He was a founding member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and served as the director of the National Museum in Krakow.
