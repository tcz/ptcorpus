		also known as Karl Medin or Dr. Karl Oskar Medin

	
was
a Swedish
pediatrician, physician and scientist.


					</p><p>He gained his medical degree in 1873 from Uppsala University and later became a professor of pediatrics at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Medin is renowned for his research and contributions to the fields of pediatric medicine and infectious diseases, particularly his discovery of the Medin virus, a type of enterovirus that causes respiratory infections. He was also a pioneer in the use of vaccination as a means of preventing infectious diseases in children. In addition to his medical work, Medin was a prominent member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences and a recipient of several honors, including the William Allan Memorial Award in 1905. His legacy continues to be felt in modern medicine, particularly in the ongoing research and treatment of infectious diseases.</p><p>Medin's work in pediatric medicine extended beyond infectious diseases. He authored influential textbooks on the subject and was instrumental in establishing specialized hospitals for children in Sweden. Medin was also a proponent of early intervention for children with developmental disorders, advocating for the creation of special classes and schools for their education. Outside of medicine, he was known for his passion for photography and was an active member of the Swedish Photographic Society. Medin continued to work as a professor at Karolinska Institute until his retirement in 1917, leaving a lasting impact on the institution and the field of pediatric medicine as a whole.</p><p>Furthermore, Medin's research on tuberculosis led to the development of the Medin tuberculin test, an early diagnostic tool for the disease. His contribution to pediatric medicine and infectious diseases also earned him the title of honorary member of the Royal Society of Medicine in the United Kingdom. Medin was known for his holistic approach to medicine and his belief in the importance of social and environmental factors in the health and well-being of children. He was a strong advocate for improving living conditions for the poor and promoting public health policies that would benefit all members of society. Medin's legacy continues to influence modern medical practices and his research on infectious diseases remains relevant today, particularly in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Despite dedicating his life to medicine, Karl Oskar Medin also had a passion for the arts. He was an accomplished pianist and composer, writing several pieces that gained popularity in Sweden during his lifetime. Medin was also known for his love of literature, and he frequently wrote articles and essays on the subject. He believed that literature was an essential part of a child's education, and he promoted reading as a means of improving both mental and physical health. Medin's interdisciplinary approach to medicine and his belief in the importance of the humanities in health care has become increasingly relevant in recent years, as many doctors and medical institutions seek to incorporate more holistic practices into their treatments. Today, Medin's legacy is celebrated not only in medicine but also in the arts and humanities, as his work continues to inspire new generations of researchers, educators, and artists.</p><p>Despite his many contributions to medicine, Medin's personal life was not without its challenges. He suffered from a debilitating illness later in life that left him largely confined to his home. Nonetheless, he remained active in his research and continued to make important contributions to the field of pediatric medicine. Medin passed away in 1927 at the age of 80, leaving behind a rich legacy that continues to influence the medical profession to this day. His work remains an inspiration to all those seeking to improve the health and well-being of children through innovative research and compassionate care.</p><p></p><p>

was
a Swedish
personality.


					</p><p>He was a renowned sculptor whose work can be found in public spaces and museums around the world. Milles studied in Paris in his early career, where he was heavily influenced by Auguste Rodin. He later moved to the United States where he became a professor at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan. Milles' sculptures often depicted mythological and historical figures, and many featured elements of water or air, giving them a sense of vibrant movement. Some of his most well-known works include the "Fountain of Faith" in St. Louis, Missouri and the "Hand of God" sculpture in Lincoln, Nebraska. Milles' legacy also includes his former estate, which is now the Carl Milles Museum in Lidingo, Sweden, where visitors can view his personal collection of artwork and admire the gardens he designed.</p><p>Milles was born Carl Wilhelm Andersson, but later changed his surname to Milles. He was born into a family of seven children and his father was a well-known lumber merchant. Milles also had a twin brother who died in infancy. Milles' artistic talent was evident from a young age, and he attended the Technical School in Stockholm before studying abroad in Paris. </p><p>In addition to his large-scale sculptures, Milles also created smaller works and was known for his decorative art. He designed a number of fountains, including the "Orpheus Fountain" in Stockholm, which was his first major public commission. Milles also received numerous awards and honors over the course of his career, including a gold medal at the 1926 World Exhibition in Philadelphia.</p><p>Milles' personal life was just as interesting as his professional one. He was married to an American woman, Olga Granner, who was his model for many of his sculptures. The couple had a son, Lasse, who was also a sculptor. Milles was also known for his love of animals and had many pets, including a family of monkeys that lived on his estate.</p><p>Today, Milles is remembered as one of Sweden's most beloved artists, and his sculptures continue to inspire generations of artists and art enthusiasts. His works can be found in cities all over the world, including New York, Paris, and Stockholm.</p><p>Despite his success as a sculptor, Milles faced challenges in his career. In the 1930s, his sculptures were removed from public spaces in Germany and other Nazi-controlled countries because they were deemed "degenerate art." He also faced criticism from some art critics, who accused him of being too commercial and lacking in artistic depth. Despite this, Milles remained dedicated to his craft and continued to create works that pushed the boundaries of sculpture.</p><p>In addition to his work as a sculptor, Milles was also involved in the design of the Cranbrook campus, where he lived and worked for many years. He designed a number of the buildings on the campus, including a chapel and several residences.</p><p>Milles' influence on the world of art cannot be overstated. He was a pioneer in the use of modern materials, such as concrete and metal, in sculpture. He also inspired a generation of artists with his innovative use of space and movement in his works. His legacy continues to be celebrated and honored today, through exhibitions of his work and through the institutions he helped to create, such as the Carl Milles Museum.</p><p>Milles was known for his attention to detail and his dedication to his craft. He was a perfectionist who would often spend hours creating small details in his sculptures, and he was always looking for new and innovative ways to express his artistic vision. One of his most famous works, the "Meeting of the Waters" fountain in St. Paul, Minnesota, features dozens of individually crafted fish, turtles, and other aquatic animals that come together in a graceful dance. Another of his well-known works, the "Man and Pegasus" sculpture in St. Louis, Missouri, features a man riding a winged horse, which appears to leap out of the water.</p><p>Milles was also known for his philanthropy, and he and his wife Olga were active in supporting art and education programs in the United States and Sweden. The couple established the Milles Foundation in 1935, which provided financial support for artists and art programs. Milles also donated many of his works to museums and public spaces, and he often went out of his way to help young artists get their start in the field.</p><p>Today, the legacy of Carl Milles lives on through the many institutions and spaces that bear his name. The Carl Milles Museum in Lidingo, Sweden, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, and it showcases much of Milles' personal artwork and memorabilia. The Cranbrook Academy of Art, where Milles taught for many years, is also still a thriving institution, and it continues to inspire new generations of artists to push the boundaries of their craft.</p><p>In addition to his contributions to the world of art, Carl Milles was also a political activist. He was a member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and was involved in workers' rights and feminist movements. Milles believed that art had the power to inspire social change, and he often incorporated political themes into his work. One of his sculptures, "The Modern Miss," depicts a young, independent woman standing proudly with her arms crossed, symbolizing the growing strength of women in society.</p><p>Milles' final years were marked by illness and declining health. He suffered a stroke in 1952, which left him partially paralyzed and unable to work. He died three years later at the age of 80, leaving behind a rich legacy of artistic inspiration and innovation. Today, his sculptures continue to captivate and inspire people around the world, and his dedication to his craft and his passion for social justice remain an inspiration to artists and activists everywhere.</p><p></p><p>
