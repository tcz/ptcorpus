He began his career in entertainment as a singer but found greater success in comedy, making a name for himself in the 1980s with his appearances on TV shows such as The Comedians and Opportunity Knocks. While his humor often divided audiences, it undoubtedly helped to popularize the stand-up comedy scene in the UK during this era.

Though he has since retired from the entertainment industry, Stan Boardman's impact on British comedy is still felt today.</p><p>Stan Boardman's controversial humor often revolved around jokes about disability, race, and gender, and this was a major reason for his divisive reputation. However, his fans saw it as his no-holds-barred approach to tackling taboo subjects that made him so successful. In 1978, he released a Christmas song titled "Stan's Christmas Song (Not the Noel Edmonds Crinkley Bottom one)" which reached number 32 in the UK charts. </p><p>In the early 1990s, Boardman was diagnosed with cancer, and this led him to adopt a new outlook on life. As a result, he stopped performing his controversial material and instead focused on entertaining audiences with clean comedy. During this time, he also became an ambassador for several charitable organizations, including the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, and he was awarded the British Empire Medal in 2019 for his services to charity.</p><p>Despite his controversial past, Stan Boardman remains a beloved figure in the comedy world and is considered one of the pioneers of British stand-up comedy.</p><p></p><p>
