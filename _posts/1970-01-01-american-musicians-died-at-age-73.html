(December 30, 1906		Lees Creek-January 28, 1980			Palm Springs)


was
an American
film producer.


					</p><p>Babb is best known for his work in the exploitation film industry, producing and promoting low-budget movies dealing with controversial and taboo subjects such as drug addiction, prostitution, and venereal disease. He was referred to as the "King of the Roadshow" due to his innovative marketing tactics, such as hosting live events and creating sensationalized trailers. Despite the criticism he faced for the content of his films, Babb was instrumental in paving the way for the independent film industry and is considered a pioneer in cinema advertising. Outside of film, Babb was also involved in radio broadcasting and politics, running unsuccessfully for mayor of Dallas in 1949.</p><p>Babb began his career as a salesman, selling everything from vacuum cleaners to insurance policies. This experience led to his talent for marketing, which he applied to the film industry. He worked closely with director/producer Elmer Clifton, producing films such as "Mom and Dad" (1945) and "She Shoulda Said No!" (1949), which were controversial for their frank portrayal of sex and drug use. Despite their controversial subjects, Babb's films were financially successful and often played to packed crowds in small towns across America.</p><p>In addition to his work in film, Babb was also a radio personality and a political activist. He hosted a popular radio talk show in Dallas in the 1940s, where he discussed topics such as politics, religion, and human behavior. He also ran for mayor of Dallas as a Republican in 1949, but was defeated by the incumbent Democrat.</p><p>Later in life, Babb moved to Palm Springs, California, where he continued to work in the entertainment industry. He owned a nightclub called "The Old Plantation" and helped produce the Palm Springs Follies, a popular vaudeville-style show that ran from 1990 to 2014. Despite his controversial past, Babb is recognized as an important figure in the history of American cinema and is remembered for his innovative marketing techniques and contributions to independent film.</p><p>Babb's promotional tactics for his films were legendary. He employed a combination of sensationalized advertising, controversial subject matter, and extensive touring of his movies through local towns and cities. His trailers featured provocative voiceovers and tantalizing clips, often implying more than the films actually delivered. He also created elaborate stage shows to complement the films, featuring exotic dancers, live music, and other forms of entertainment. In this way, Babb built a large and loyal fan base, particularly among less affluent and rural audiences.</p><p>Babb's most infamous film was probably "Mom and Dad," which purported to be a frank educational film about sex education, but really served as a vehicle for salacious content. The movie outraged many conservative groups, but Babb was unapologetic, arguing that he was providing information that was largely absent from public discourse. His other films similarly pushed buttons with topics like childbirth, drug addiction, and juvenile delinquency.</p><p>Babb's legacy has continued to inspire filmmakers and exploiters alike. His influence can be seen in everything from shockumentaries like "Faces of Death" to the more controversial output of directors like John Waters and Russ Meyer. Although he never won mainstream recognition, Babb played an important role in shaping the cinema of the mid-twentieth century and beyond.</p><p>In addition to his promotional tactics, Babb was also known for his showmanship. He would often make personal appearances at screenings of his films, sometimes even posing as a doctor or expert to add credibility to the educational messages in his movies. Babb was also innovative in his use of technology, using stereophonic sound and 3-D effects in his films to enhance their impact. </p><p>However, Babb's career was not without controversy. His films were criticized for exploiting their subjects and promoting harmful stereotypes. Some accused him of exploiting vulnerable communities, such as sex workers and drug addicts, for profit. Additionally, Babb was arrested on several occasions for obscenity charges related to his films. </p><p>Despite these criticisms, Babb remained committed to his work and continued to produce and promote films until his death in 1980. He left behind a lasting legacy in the world of independent cinema, inspiring generations of filmmakers to push boundaries and challenge social norms.</p><p></p><p>

During his military career, Doubleday fought in the Mexican-American War and served in various posts throughout the country.</p><p>As the Civil War began, Doubleday was stationed at Fort Sumter in South Carolina. He played a key role in defending the fort against Confederate forces and was later promoted to Brigadier General. Doubleday fought in several major battles, including the Battle of Gettysburg.</p><p>After the war, Doubleday continued to serve in the Army and was involved in the development of the garrison system, which helped to modernize the U.S. military. He also wrote several influential books on military tactics and strategy, including "Reminiscences of Forts Sumter and Moultrie" and "Chancellorsville and Gettysburg: Campaigns of the Civil War."</p><p>Despite his military accomplishments, Doubleday is best known for his association with the sport of baseball.

Nevertheless, Doubleday remains an important figure in American history and a symbol of the country's resilience during a time of great conflict. His legacy continues to inspire military leaders and sports enthusiasts alike.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Doubleday's claim to have invented baseball has been widely refuted by historians. In fact, the origin of baseball is a matter of much debate and is believed to have developed from various early bat-and-ball games played in England and the United States. The myth of Doubleday's invention likely originated from a letter written by baseball enthusiast Albert Spalding in the early 20th century, who sought to cement baseball as an American invention. Nevertheless, Doubleday's name remains attached to the myth and he is often cited as the father of baseball.</p><p>In addition to his military and intellectual pursuits, Doubleday was also a devoted family man. He married Mary Hewitt in 1852 and the couple had two children. Despite the demands of his military career, Doubleday remained close with his family and corresponded with them regularly.</p><p>Today, Abner Doubleday is remembered as an important and complex figure in American history.

		also known as Thomas S. Kuhn or Thomas Samuel Kuhn

	
was
an American
historian, philosopher, scientist and physicist.


					</p><p>Kuhn is best known for his influential book "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" (1962), in which he introduced the concept of a "paradigm shift" to describe the way scientific knowledge advances. Prior to its publication, Kuhn was a professor of philosophy and history of science at Harvard University, but the book's success launched him to international fame. Kuhn argued that scientific progress was not a linear process of accumulation, but rather a series of revolutions in which existing paradigms were overthrown and replaced by new ones. The book had a significant impact on the philosophy of science, and Kuhn's concepts are still widely cited and discussed today. Kuhn was also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><p>In addition to "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions," Thomas Kuhn also wrote several other influential works in the fields of history, philosophy, and science. These include "The Copernican Revolution" (1957), which explored the transition from the geocentric to the heliocentric model of the solar system, and "The Essential Tension" (1977), which examined the relationship between theory and observation in science.</p><p>Kuhn's ideas were not always universally accepted, and some philosophers and scientists criticized his emphasis on revolutions and paradigms over empirical evidence and objective truth. Nevertheless, his work continues to be widely studied and debated in universities and academic circles.</p><p>Beyond his scholarly career, Kuhn was an accomplished musician who played the clarinet and saxophone. He also served in the United States Army during World War II and was awarded the Bronze Star for his service.</p><p>Kuhn's work was not limited to the history and philosophy of science. In later years, he also taught courses in the social and political dimensions of science, and he contributed to debates about the role of science in society. His interest in the social and political implications of science was reflected in his participation in the anti-Vietnam War movement and his contributions to debates about science education and science policy. In recognition of his contributions to the field of science studies, Kuhn was awarded numerous honors and awards, including the George Sarton Medal of the History of Science Society and the James H. H. Tate Medal for Excellence in Undergraduate Advising from MIT. Today, Kuhn's legacy continues to shape our understanding of science and the scientific enterprise.</p><p>During his career, Kuhn was also a visiting professor at several universities, including UC Berkeley, Princeton, and Oxford. He was a prolific writer and his works have been translated into over 20 languages. In addition to his academic pursuits, Kuhn was also a dedicated mentor and advisor to many students, including numerous graduate students who went on to become influential figures in their own right. Kuhn's impact on the philosophy of science is still recognized today, with disagreements over his ideas continuing among scholars in the field. Despite this, his influence on the study of science is undeniable, and his work remains a foundational text in the history and philosophy of science.</p><p></p><p>
