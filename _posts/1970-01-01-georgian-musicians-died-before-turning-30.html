was
a Georgian
personality.


					</p><p>He was one of the leaders of the paramilitary organization "Mkhedrioni" in the 1990s, which aimed to restore order and protect Georgian sovereignty during the tumultuous years of post-Soviet transition. Abashidze was a controversial figure, known for his confrontational tactics and alleged involvement in several violent incidents. </p><p>After the fall of the Soviet Union, Abashidze became involved in the military conflict in Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia, which was seeking independence. He led a paramilitary group in the region and fought against Abkhazian separatists. In September 1992, Abashidze was killed in a battle in Sukhumi, the capital of Abkhazia. </p><p>Despite his divisive legacy, Abashidze remains a prominent figure in Georgian history, remembered as a charismatic leader who fought for his country's independence and sovereignty during a time of great turmoil and uncertainty.</p><p>Abashidze's early years were marked by tragedy as his father, a well-known Georgian film director, was killed in a mysterious car accident when he was only 15 years old.

He was one of the founders of Mkhedrioni, which was initially formed to fight against criminal organizations in Georgia, but later became embroiled in political and military conflicts. Abashidze was known for his fiery speeches and bold actions, but also for his close ties to Georgian business tycoons and politicians, which led to accusations of corruption and abuse of power. In addition to his involvement in the conflict in Abkhazia, Abashidze also played a role in the civil war in Georgia in the early 1990s.
