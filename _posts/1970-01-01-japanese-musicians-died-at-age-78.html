was
a Japanese
personality.


					</p><p>He was a Buddhist priest and the founder of the Jōdo-shū sect of Buddhism in Japan. He is often remembered as the person who popularized the chanting of the Name of Amida Buddha among the common people in Japan. Hōnen's teachings encouraged people to seek salvation by reciting the phrase "Namu Amida Butsu" which means "I take refuge in the Amida Buddha". This became known as the nembutsu practice and it gained widespread popularity during his lifetime. Hōnen is considered an important figure in the history of Japanese Buddhism and his legacy continues to inspire people around the world today.</p><p>Hōnen was born in Kume, Japan and was originally named Seishimaru. He studied Buddhist teachings at a young age and became a monk at the age of nine. In his early years as a monk, Hōnen was influenced by the teachings of Micchaka, a Chinese monk who emphasized the importance of reciting the name of Amida Buddha as a means of attaining enlightenment. </p><p>Hōnen's focus on the nembutsu practice put him at odds with other Buddhist schools, who believed in different practices for salvation. His teachings were considered radical at the time and he faced persecution from religious authorities. Despite this, Hōnen persisted in spreading his message and eventually gained a large following of disciples.</p><p>In 1207, Hōnen was exiled from Kyoto as part of a wider crackdown on his followers, known as the Jōkyū Disturbance. He spent the next few years traveling and spreading his teachings throughout Japan, eventually returning to Kyoto in 1211. Hōnen died the following year at the age of 79.</p><p>Today, the Jōdo-shū sect of Buddhism has millions of followers in Japan and around the world. Hōnen is remembered as a visionary who sought to make Buddhism accessible to everyone, regardless of social status or education. His legacy lives on through his teachings and the continued practice of the nembutsu.</p><p></p><p>
