						Although Pontecorvo began his career as a chemistry student, his love for the arts led him to pursue a career in filmmaking. He is perhaps best known for his critically acclaimed 1966 film "The Battle of Algiers", which is considered a masterpiece of political cinema. A semi-documentary style film, it depicted the Algerian War and the tactics used by both the French government and the National Liberation Front. </p><p>Pontecorvo's career spanned several decades and he directed a number of other acclaimed films, including "Kap√≤" (1960), "Burn!" (1969), and "Ogro" (1979). He was also a prolific screenwriter, actor, and composer, and contributed to many productions over the course of his career.</p><p>In addition to his work in film, Pontecorvo was an active member of the Italian Resistance during World War II and later became involved in left-wing politics. He was awarded numerous honors throughout his life, including the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the 2006 Venice Film Festival shortly before his passing.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=1939901" title="Wikipedia article about Gillo Pontecorvo">Gillo Pontecorvo on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/french-actors-died-in-multiple-myeloma.html' title='French actors died in Multiple myeloma'><strong>French actors died in Multiple myeloma</strong> List of the top 1 French actors who died in Multiple myeloma</a></li><li><a href='/french-musicians-died-before-turning-35.html' title='French musicians died before turning 35'><strong>French musicians died before turning 35</strong> List of the top 19 French music stars who died before 35</a></li><li><a href='/french-actors-died-in-1992.html' title='French actors died in 1992'><strong>French actors died in 1992</strong> List of the top 10 French actors who died in 1992</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/australian-actors-died-in-kidney-cancer.html' title='Australian actors died in Kidney cancer'><strong>Australian actors died in Kidney cancer</strong> List of the top 1 Australian actors who died in Kidney cancer</a></li><li><a href='/australian-musicians-born-in-1960.html' title='Australian musicians born in 1960'><strong>Australian musicians born in 1960</strong> List of the top 15 Australian  music stars who died in who were born in 1960</a></li><li><a href='/australian-musicians-born-in-1941.html' title='Australian musicians born in 1941'><strong>Australian musicians born in 1941</strong> List of the top 11 Australian  music stars who died in who were born in 1941</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
