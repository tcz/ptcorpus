(October 13, 1824		Brandenburg-July 25, 1866)

	
		also known as Alexander Rustow

	
was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a lawyer and politician who played an important role in the liberal movements during the pre-1848 period. He served as a member of the Prussian Landtag and was a vocal advocate for legal reform and the protection of civil rights. Rustow was also involved in the 1848 Revolution, where he called for a constitutional monarchy and a united Germany. After the revolution, he went into exile in Switzerland where he continued his activism and writings on political theory. Rustow died tragically at the age of 42, having contracted cholera during an epidemic that swept through Switzerland at the time. His ideas and contributions to German liberalism and constitutionalism continue to be studied and debated by scholars and historians today.</p><p>Rustow was born into a family of lawyers, and following in his family's footsteps, he studied law at the University of Berlin. He also developed an interest in philosophy and political theory, which would later influence his political activism. In addition to his political involvement, Rustow was also a prolific writer and scholar. He wrote extensively on topics such as political theory, legal reform, and German history. Some of his notable works include "The German Revolution and its Preludes" and "The Development of Political Freedom in Germany." Rustow was also involved in founding several academic journals, including the "Jahrbuch für Gesetzgebung, Verwaltung, und Volkswirtschaft im Deutschen Reich."</p><p>Despite his contributions to German liberalism, Rustow's legacy has been somewhat overshadowed by his more famous brother, Wilhelm Rüstow, who was a military strategist and played a prominent role in the 1848 Revolution. Nevertheless, Rustow remains an important figure in the history of German liberalism and constitutionalism, and his ideas continue to be studied and debated by scholars today.</p><p></p><p>
