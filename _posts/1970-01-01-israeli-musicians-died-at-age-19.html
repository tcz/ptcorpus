(July 9, 1986		Rishon LeZion-August 4, 2005			Shefa-&#039;Amr)


was
an Israeli
soldier.


					</p><p>Eden Natan-Zada was a Jewish Israeli soldier who became infamous for his involvement in the shooting at a bus station in the Arab-Israeli town of Shefa-Amr in August 2005. Natan-Zada, a member of the right-wing Jewish nationalist movement, was on a mission to carry out a revenge attack against what he perceived as the Israeli government's "disengagement plan" that involved evacuating Israeli settlements from the Gaza Strip.</p><p>After arriving in Shefa-Amr, he opened fire on a bus, killing four Arab-Israeli civilians and injuring many others. In the aftermath of the shooting, angry crowds swarmed around Natan-Zada. Despite his surrender to the police, the crowds lynched him and killed him on the spot.</p><p>The incident sparked widespread outrage and unrest among both Israelis and Palestinians. The Israeli government denounced Natan-Zada's actions, while Palestinians viewed him as a symbol of Jewish aggression against their community. The incident highlighted the deep-seated tensions and polarizations that exist between Israel and Palestine, and it remains a poignant reminder of the ongoing conflict between the two communities.</p><p>Eden Natan-Zada was born on July 9, 1986, in Rishon LeZion, Israel, and was raised in a religious Jewish family. He was conscripted into the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) at the age of 18 and served as a soldier in a combat unit. After completing his service, he became active in the right-wing Jewish nationalist movement and opposed the Israeli government's plans to evacuate Israeli settlements from the Gaza Strip.</p><p>Natan-Zada's attack on the bus station in Shefa-Amr on August 4, 2005, shocked the nation and drew widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum. Israeli officials described his actions as a "heinous crime" and vowed to hold him accountable. The incident also raised questions about the government's ability to prevent attacks by extremist individuals and groups.</p><p>In the aftermath of Natan-Zada's shooting, both Israelis and Palestinians grappled with the implications of the incident. Some saw it as evidence of the deep-seated hatred and animosity that exists between the two communities, while others viewed it as a tragic reminder of the toll that years of conflict have taken on both sides.</p><p>Despite the upheaval and unrest that followed Natan-Zada's attack, his legacy continues to inspire controversy and debate. Some view him as a martyr and a symbol of Jewish resistance against perceived threats to Israel's security, while others condemn his actions as a misguided and reprehensible attempt to sow further discord and division.</p><p>The aftermath of Eden Natan-Zada's attack saw a surge of violence and tension between the Jewish and Arab communities in Israel. There were retaliatory attacks by Jewish nationalists against Arab targets, and several Palestinian attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians. The incident also sparked a debate in Israel about the role of militant right-wing groups and the government's responsibility to rein them in.The family and supporters of Eden Natan-Zada decried his lynching as a tragic and unjust act of violence, while many others saw it as a fitting punishment for his heinous crime. Natan-Zada's mother and father were both arrested in the aftermath of the incident for incitement to violence against Arabs, but they were later released without charge.Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, Eden Natan-Zada remains a prominent figure in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. His attack at the Shefa-Amr bus station is frequently cited as an example of the extreme violence and hatred that can arise from the bitter and deeply entrenched divisions between the two communities. The incident continues to be remembered in Israel and around the world as a tragedy that underscores the urgent need for peace and reconciliation in the region.</p><p>Natan-Zada's attack and subsequent lynching triggered a number of legal and political debates in Israel. Some critics argued that the government had failed to adequately address the threat posed by extremist right-wing groups, while others questioned the role of the media in stoking tensions and fueling violence. In addition, some lawmakers pushed for stricter laws to curb incitement and hate speech on both sides of the conflict.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his actions, Natan-Zada has become something of a martyr figure in certain right-wing circles in Israel. Some activists have organized protests and rallies in his honor, arguing that he was a brave defender of Jewish rights and sovereignty in the face of Arab aggression. However, his legacy remains deeply divisive, with many Israelis and Palestinians alike viewing him as a symbol of the ongoing conflict and an obstacle to peace and reconciliation in the region.</p><p>In the years since the attack, Israeli and Palestinian leaders have made little progress towards resolving the underlying issues that fuel the conflict. Tensions have continued to flare up periodically, with outbreaks of violence and unrest occurring on both sides. Despite the challenges, however, many peace activists and advocates continue to work tirelessly towards a lasting solution to the conflict, with the hope that someday the region can move beyond the legacy of violence and division that has plagued it for generations.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 2015-April 5, 1996)

	
		also known as Chaim Rabin

	
was
an Israeli
personality.


					</p><p>Chaim Rabin was born in Jerusalem, Palestine, during the British mandate period. He grew up in a political family, his father being an elected official in the Jewish Agency. Rabin joined the Haganah, the precursor to the Israeli Defense Forces, in 1940 and served as an intelligence officer during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.</p><p>After the war, Rabin continued to serve in the IDF, rising through the ranks to become Chief of Staff in 1964. He played a key role in the Six-Day War of 1967, which saw Israel capture large territories from its neighbors.</p><p>Rabin retired from the military in 1968, and became an ambassador to the United States. In 1974 he became the first native-born Israeli to be appointed Prime Minister of Israel. During his tenure, he pursued negotiations with the Palestinians and signed the Oslo Accords in 1993, which aimed to provide a framework for peaceful coexistence.</p><p>Rabin was assassinated on November 4, 1995 by a right-wing Jewish extremist opposed to the peace process. He is remembered as a symbol of peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.</p><p>Chaim Rabin's impact on Israeli politics and society was significant. He was instrumental in shaping Israel's military strategy, and his leadership during the Six-Day War is credited with the success of the Israeli military campaign. As Prime Minister, he pursued a policy of compromise with the Palestinians, which earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994. The Oslo Accords, which he signed with PLO leader Yasser Arafat, were a major step towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but they also proved controversial, with some Israelis accusing Rabin of making too many concessions to the Palestinians. Despite this, Rabin's legacy as a peacemaker and a visionary leader endures, and he is widely regarded as one of Israel's greatest statesmen. His assassination shocked the world and underscored the deep divisions within Israeli society over the peace process.</p><p>In addition to his military and political career, Chaim Rabin was also a writer, publishing several books on his experiences and perspectives. He was particularly interested in military strategy and the role of the military in Israeli society. Rabin was also a founding member of Kibbutz Nachal Oz, a cooperative settlement devoted to agriculture and social justice. </p><p>Rabin's assassination had a profound impact on Israel and the region, sparking widespread protests and political turmoil. It also marked a turning point in Israeli politics, with the peace process losing momentum in the years following Rabin's death. Nevertheless, his vision of a two-state solution remains a goal for many Israelis and Palestinians, and his legacy as a leader committed to peace continues to inspire generations.</p><p>Chaim Rabin was married to Leah Rabin, a prominent activist and advocate for social justice in Israel. Leah Rabin was also deeply involved in the peace process and worked closely with her husband to promote a more peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. Following Chaim Rabin's assassination, Leah became a powerful voice for peace and reconciliation, carrying on her husband's legacy and advocating for greater understanding and cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians. She passed away in 2000, but her contributions to Israeli society and her unwavering commitment to peace continue to inspire many.</p><p></p><p>
