After the war, several of his recordings were released, including "Shanghai Shuffle" and "Indian Boogie Woogie", which showcased his unique style.

She quickly gained fame across Europe and was known for her performances in Mozart's operas, particularly the role of Zerlina in "Don Giovanni." </p><p>Over the course of her career, Sontag performed in many major opera houses and was a favorite of important composers such as Rossini and Meyerbeer.

Sadly, Sontag's career was cut short by her untimely death in 1854 at the age of 48.

In addition to her success in opera, Sontag was also a skilled musician who played several instruments, including the piano, guitar, and harp. She was known for her philanthropic efforts and often used her performances to raise funds for charitable causes. Despite her early retirement from the stage, Sontag's influence was felt long after her death, as her style and technique inspired generations of opera singers. Her legacy continues to be celebrated today, with several music festivals and awards named in her honor.</p><p></p><p>
