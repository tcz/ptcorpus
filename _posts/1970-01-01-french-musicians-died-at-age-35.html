(March 31, 1909		Perpignan-February 6, 1945			Montrouge)


was
a French
writer and novelist.


					</p><p>Brasillach was a controversial figure due to his collaboration with the Nazi occupation forces during World War II. He was an active supporter of the Vichy regime and contributed to several pro-Nazi publications. After the war ended, he was tried and sentenced for treason and collaboration with the enemy. Despite pleas for clemency from intellectuals such as Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, Brasillach was executed by firing squad in 1945. His legacy remains divisive, with some admiring his literary talents and others condemning his political beliefs and actions.</p><p>Brasillach's writing career began in the 1930s and he gained a reputation as an innovative and talented writer. He worked as a journalist and editor, with his most famous work being the novel "Les Sept Couleurs" (The Seven Colors). Brasillach was also a member of the Académie française, France's most prestigious literary society. </p><p>During the war, Brasillach was involved in the National Popular Rally, a collaborationist group that sought to align France with Nazi Germany. He wrote for the pro-Nazi publication "Je suis partout" (I am everywhere) and actively promoted anti-Semitic and anti-Communist views. </p><p>Despite his controversial views and actions, Brasillach retained a significant following among literary circles, with many arguing that his execution was a violation of free speech and artistic expression. However, others have criticized Brasillach for his collaboration with the Nazis and the harm he caused to French society. </p><p>In recent years, Brasillach's legacy has been re-examined, with some arguing that his literary talents should be evaluated separately from his political views. Nevertheless, his collaboration with the Nazis and his support for their ideology continues to be a source of controversy and debate.</p><p></p><p>
