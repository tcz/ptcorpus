Despite Colombia's disappointing performance in the World Cup, Escobar was highly respected by his teammates and fans alike for his dedication to the sport.</p><p>Tragically, just 10 days after returning to Colombia following the World Cup, Escobar was shot and killed outside a bar in Medellín. His murder was believed to be in retaliation for an own goal he scored during a match against the United States, which contributed to Colombia's early exit from the World Cup.

Escobar was also an advocate for peace in Colombia and used his platform to speak out against violence and corruption in the country. Following his death, Escobar's legacy has continued to inspire and his memory has been honored in various ways, including through documentaries, memorials, and the annual "Andrés Escobar Fair Play Award," which recognizes sportsmanship and fair play in football. His death remains a tragic reminder of the violence and turmoil that plagued Colombia during that time, and the need for peace and justice in the country.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Andrés Escobar's impact on football and Colombian society lives on. He is still considered one of the greatest defenders in Colombian football history and his legacy as a passionate, dedicated and fair player is celebrated around the world. In 2002, he was inducted into the Colombian Football Hall of Fame, and in 2004, ESPN named him the third-best Colombian footballer of all time. In 2010, a documentary film titled "The Two Escobars" was released, exploring the parallel lives of Andrés Escobar and Pablo Escobar, the infamous drug lord who terrorized Colombia. The film showcased Andres' love for football and country, and his efforts to bring social change to Colombia through his foundation, El Jardin. Today, his memory lives on through the foundation and through the annual Andrés Escobar Fair Play Award, which is given to players who demonstrate the highest standards of sportsmanship and fair play. Escobar's legacy reminds us of the power of football to unite people and inspire positive change in the world.</p><p></p><p>
