was
a New Zealand
lawyer.


					</p><p>She was the first woman to graduate with a law degree from a New Zealand university, and also the first woman to be admitted as a barrister and solicitor in New Zealand. Over the course of her legal career, Benjamin was a fierce advocate for women's rights and played a key role in advancing the cause of women's suffrage in New Zealand. In addition to her legal work, she was also involved in a number of other social and political causes, including the temperance movement and efforts to improve public health. Despite facing significant opposition and discrimination as a woman in a male-dominated profession, Benjamin's pioneering work paved the way for many other women to follow in her footsteps and pursue careers in law.</p><p>After completing her law degree, Ethel Benjamin returned to her hometown of Dunedin and started her own legal practice in 1897. However, due to societal prejudices against women in the legal profession, she struggled to gain clients and many of her male colleagues refused to work with her. Despite these challenges, she continued to fight for gender equality in her work and public appearances. </p><p>In 1898, Benjamin's efforts paid off when she was admitted to practice as a barrister and solicitor in the Supreme Court of New Zealand. This landmark achievement made her the first female lawyer not only in New Zealand, but in the entire British Empire. Benjamin's work continued to focus on advocating for women's rights and encouraging other women to pursue careers in law, a path which had previously been closed off to them.</p><p>Throughout her career, Ethel Benjamin continued to actively campaign for the rights of other marginalized groups, such as children and minorities. She was involved in founding several charitable organizations and was a member of the New Zealand Women's Christian Temperance Union. Benjamin remained an active and vocal feminist until her death in 1943 at the age of 68. Her legacy as a trailblazer for women's rights and an inspiration to female lawyers around the world lives on to this day.</p><p></p><p>
