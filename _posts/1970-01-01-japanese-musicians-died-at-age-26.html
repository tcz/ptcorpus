Ishikawa's poetry often delved into personal and emotional themes, such as his struggles with illness and poverty, as well as social commentary on Japanese society during the tumultuous time of the Meiji and Taisho periods. He also had a keen interest in Western literature, particularly the works of Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Baudelaire, and incorporated elements of their styles into his own writing. Despite his relatively short career, Ishikawa Takuboku's impact on Japanese literature and poetry continues to be felt to this day.</p><p></p><p>
