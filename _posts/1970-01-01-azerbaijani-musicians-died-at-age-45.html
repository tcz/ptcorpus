In 1938, during the height of Stalin's purges, she was accused of being an enemy of the state and sentenced to death by firing squad. Her execution was part of a larger campaign to eliminate perceived threats to the Soviet regime, which resulted in the deaths of countless innocent people. Despite the tragic circumstances of her death, Gayibova's legacy lives on through her music and the countless students she inspired and taught throughout her career.</p><p></p><p>
