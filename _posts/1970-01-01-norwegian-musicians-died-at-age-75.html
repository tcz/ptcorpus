Skolem's work in logic had a significant impact on the foundations of computer science and his theorems on power sets continue to be studied today.</p><p>Skolem was born into a family of farmers and early on in life, showed an aptitude for mathematics. He studied at the University of Oslo, where he obtained his doctorate in mathematics at the age of 24. Skolem's early work focused on the foundations of arithmetic and number theory. Later, he turned his attention to mathematical logic and set theory, where he made his most significant contributions.</p><p>Skolem's work on set theory and its relation to mathematical logic led to the creation of Skolem functions and Skolemization. Skolemization is a technique used to convert statements involving quantifiers into equivalent statements without quantifiers. This work allowed for the development of formal systems that are used in mathematical logic today.</p><p>Skolem's work was not limited to mathematics, and he was involved in politics as well.
