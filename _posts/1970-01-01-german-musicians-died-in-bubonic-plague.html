					</p><p>composer, organist, and choir director who spent most of his career in Denmark. At the age of 24, he became the organist at the St. Nikolai Church in his hometown of G端strow. In 1688, Geist moved to Copenhagen to take the position of second organist at the Church of Our Lady, and eventually became the first organist in 1693. </p><p>Geist is known for his sacred vocal music, particularly his cantatas, which were performed at the Church of Our Lady as well as at other churches and events. He was a leading figure in the development of the Danish Baroque style, combining Italian and French influences. </p><p>Aside from his musical accomplishments, Geist was also known for his work as a music teacher and mentor. He taught many talented students, including his successor as first organist at the Church of Our Lady, Johann Adolph Scheibe.</p><p>Geist was also a prolific composer of instrumental music, including preludes, fugues, and variations for the organ. Some of his notable works include "O quam tu pulchra es," "Plorate filii Israel," and "Ach Herr wie lang." In addition to his musical activities, Geist was a respected member of the community and was involved in philanthropic work. He was a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters and was appointed an honorary court composer by King Christian V of Denmark. Geist's legacy continues to be celebrated in Denmark and Germany, with his music being performed and recorded by modern musicians.</p><p>Geist was born into a family of musicians, and it is likely that his father was his first music teacher. He received further education in music in L端beck and Hamburg before returning to G端strow. Geist's compositions were often characterized by their complexity and emotional depth, and his works for the organ are noted for their technical virtuosity. His contributions to Danish music have been celebrated by scholars and performers alike, and his music has been described as representing the very best of the Danish Baroque style. In addition to his sacred music, Geist also composed secular vocal works and pieces for the keyboard. Despite his achievements, Geist's life was not without its difficulties. He suffered from poor health for much of his life and experienced financial struggles. However, his legacy as a composer and musical educator continues to inspire musicians and music lovers to this day.</p><p>Geist's legacy reached beyond his own compositions, as he also played a crucial role in the development of Danish musical culture through his teachings. Among his notable students were the aforementioned Johann Adolph Scheibe, and also Johann Joachim Quantz, who became a court musician for Frederick the Great of Prussia. Despite his contributions to Danish music and his acclaim as a composer and teacher, Geist's music largely fell out of favor in the centuries following his death. However, a revival of interest in his works occurred in the 20th century, with his works performed and recorded by modern ensembles. In recognition of his contributions to music, a street in Copenhagen was named after him in 1922.</p><p></p><p>
