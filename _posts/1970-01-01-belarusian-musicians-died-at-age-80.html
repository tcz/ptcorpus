(July 22, 1895		Hlybokaye-September 15, 1975			Moscow)


was
a Belarusian
aerospace engineer and engineer.


					</p><p>He was the founder of the Sukhoi Design Bureau, one of the world's oldest and most prestigious manufacturers of military aircraft. Sukhoi began his career in aviation in the early 1920s and played a major role in the development of early Soviet military aircraft. He designed numerous successful fighter planes during World War II, including the Su-2, Su-6, and Su-7. Sukhoi's work post-war resulted in the development of the Su-9 and Su-11 interceptor aircraft, and later the Su-15, one of the fastest and highest-flying fighters of its time. Sukhoi was awarded numerous honors during his lifetime, including the Stalin Prize and the USSR State Prize.</p><p>In addition to his work as an aerospace engineer, Sukhoi was also a talented painter and poet. He was known to incorporate his artistic skills into his work, often sketching his designs before they were finalized. Despite the success of his designs, Sukhoi was not free from controversy. In the early 1950s, his bureau was accused of producing planes that were too heavy and inefficient, and he was briefly removed from his position. However, Sukhoi was able to quickly bounce back, leading his team to create some of the most iconic aircraft in history, including the Su-24 and Su-27. Today, the Sukhoi Design Bureau remains a leading manufacturer of fighter jets and is a symbol of Russian aerospace innovation.</p><p>Sukhoi was born in the village of Hlybokaye, which was then part of the Russian Empire but is now located in present-day Belarus. He attended and graduated from the Imperial Moscow Technical School in 1918, just after the Bolshevik Revolution. Sukhoi was originally interested in studying architecture but shifted his focus to aeronautics when he witnessed the potential of aviation during World War I.</p><p>During the 1930s, Sukhoi became heavily involved in Soviet aviation politics, often facing competition from other designers and bureaus. Despite this, he continued to produce innovative designs, such as the Su-2, which was used extensively during World War II. After the war, Sukhoi became heavily involved in creating high-altitude interceptors to counter American strategic bombers. His designs, such as the Su-15, were successful in this regard and became a major part of the Soviet Union's air defense system.</p><p>Sukhoi's legacy in the aerospace industry continues to this day. The company he founded, the Sukhoi Design Bureau, has produced some of the most advanced fighter jets in the world, including the Su-35 and Su-57. These aircraft have been used in combat in conflicts such as the Syrian Civil War and have been exported to countries such as China and India. Sukhoi's innovations have also been essential in the development of hypersonic missiles, a key component of modern military strategy.</p><p>Beyond his contributions to aerospace technology, Sukhoi was known for his interest in the arts. He was an amateur painter and poet and often incorporated his artistic skills into his work as an engineer. He died in 1975 at the age of 80 and was buried in Moscow's Novodevichy Cemetery, alongside other famous Soviet figures.</p><p></p><p>
