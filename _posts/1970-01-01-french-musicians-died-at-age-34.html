(February 3, 1909		Paris-August 24, 1943			Ashford)

	
		also known as Red virgin or The Martian

	
was
a French
philosopher, teacher, political activist and writer.


					</p><p>Simone Weil was born to a Jewish family in Paris and was known for her strong social and political beliefs. She was a teacher of philosophy at various institutions and was actively involved in political activism, particularly in the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II. Weil's writings focus on topics such as suffering, poverty and the human condition, and her most notable works include "Gravity and Grace" and "The Need for Roots." She also had a strong interest in religious and spiritual issues and explored Christianity, as well as other religious traditions, throughout her life. Despite her many accomplishments, Weil struggled with mental health issues and died at the young age of 34 while living in exile in England. Today, she is widely regarded as a leading philosopher of the 20th century and her work continues to influence scholars and activists around the world.</p><p>Weil's political activism began during her time at the École Normale Supérieure, where she became involved in left-wing politics and joined the French Communist Party. However, she soon became disillusioned with the party and left to join the Trotskyist movement. Weil's experiences in the Spanish Civil War only strengthened her convictions and she later joined the French Resistance during World War II, working as a factory laborer and eventually serving as a member of the Free French Air Force.</p><p>Weil's writings were diverse and covered a range of topics. In addition to her philosophical works, she also wrote articles and essays on political and social issues. One notable example was her essay "The Iliad, or the Poem of Force," which explored the relationship between power and violence. Weil was also a prolific letter-writer and her correspondence with various intellectuals, including Albert Camus, has been published.</p><p>Despite her Jewish background, Weil was drawn to Christianity and even considered becoming a Christian mystic. She believed that Christianity offered a unique perspective on suffering and the human condition, and her exploration of Christian theology and mysticism greatly influenced her later writings.</p><p>Today, Weil's work continues to be studied and celebrated by scholars and activists alike. Her ideas on empathy and compassion, as well as her critiques of power and violence, continue to resonate with people around the world.</p><p>Throughout her life, Simone Weil was known for her staunch refusal to compromise on her principles. She lived an ascetic lifestyle, often going without food or sleep so that she could better understand the struggles of the poor and marginalized. She saw her own suffering as a way of connecting with others who were similarly marginalized or oppressed. This deep empathy and compassion for others is a central theme of her work.</p><p>Weil's influence on 20th century philosophy cannot be overstated. Albert Camus, who corresponded with Weil for a time, once said that she "might well be the patron saint of all outsiders." Weil's ideas on the interconnectedness of all living beings and her belief in the importance of empathy and compassion continue to inspire people today. Her work on the relationship between power and violence has been especially influential, with many activists and scholars drawing on her insights to better understand the dynamics of oppression and resistance in modern society.</p><p></p><p>

(March 2, 1760		Guise-April 5, 1794			Place de la Concorde)


was
a French
lawyer.


					</p><p>Desmoulins was a key figure in the French Revolution and a fervent supporter of the Jacobin movement. He became famous for his fiery oratory and was a close friend of revolutionaries such as Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton. Desmoulins played a significant role in inciting the storming of the Bastille in 1789, which marked the beginning of the revolution. He was also a prolific journalist and writer, contributing to various newspapers and publishing several works on politics and literature. Despite his contributions to the revolution, Desmoulins fell out of favor with Robespierre, who accused him of being a counter-revolutionary. He was arrested in 1794 and, along with his wife Lucile and many others, was sent to the guillotine. His death was seen as a tragic loss by many of his contemporaries, who saw him as a passionate and visionary leader of the revolution.</p><p>Desmoulins was born into a wealthy family in Guise, France. He studied law in Paris and became a lawyer in 1785. Despite his legal training, Desmoulins was drawn to politics and became involved in revolutionary circles in the years leading up to the revolution. He became known for his radical views and incendiary rhetoric, which helped to galvanize support for the revolution.</p><p>In addition to his activism, Desmoulins was also a prolific writer. He contributed to various newspapers and wrote several influential pamphlets, including "Français, encore un effort si vous voulez être républicains" ("Frenchmen, one more effort if you want to be republicans"), which called for an end to the monarchy and the establishment of a republic.</p><p>Despite his early success, Desmoulins fell out of favor with Robespierre and other members of the Committee of Public Safety. He was arrested and accused of conspiring against the revolution. Desmoulins was sent to the guillotine in April 1794, along with his wife Lucile and many of his closest friends and allies.</p><p>Desmoulins' legacy as a revolutionary leader and writer has endured to this day. He is remembered as a passionate and visionary leader who played a crucial role in the French Revolution, even as his life was cut short by the very forces he helped to unleash.</p><p>Desmoulins was also known for his close friendships with other prominent revolutionaries, such as Jean-Paul Marat and Camille Jordan. He was a prolific letter writer and maintained a wide network of correspondents throughout his life. Desmoulins was married to Lucile Duplessis, whom he had met while studying in Paris. Their marriage was seen as a symbol of the revolution, as they had married in a civil ceremony rather than a religious one. Lucile was also known for her political activism and was executed alongside her husband.Despite his radical views and contributions to the revolution, Desmoulins' legacy has been somewhat controversial over time. Some have criticized his fiery rhetoric and accused him of inciting violence and extremism. Others have argued that he was a visionary leader who helped to bring about a more just and democratic society. Regardless of these debates, it is clear that Desmoulins played a significant role in the French Revolution and his ideas continue to inspire political movements around the world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by guillotine.

(March 1, 1760		Évreux-June 18, 1794)

	
		a.k.a. Francois Buzot

	
was
a French
lawyer and politician.


					</p><p>François Buzot was a prominent figure during the French Revolution and played an important role in drafting the Constitution of 1793. He was a member of the Girondins, a group of moderate republicans who aimed to limit the power of the Jacobins and preserve the gains of the revolution. Buzot was a fierce critic of the radical faction led by Maximilien Robespierre and opposed the Reign of Terror.</p><p>In 1793, Buzot was elected to the National Convention, France's first elected legislature. He quickly emerged as a leader of the Girondins and advocated for a federalist system in which the power would be shared between central and local authorities. However, the Jacobins, who held a majority in the convention, opposed Buzot's vision and ultimately outlawed the Girondins.</p><p>As the Reign of Terror intensified and many of his colleagues were arrested and executed, Buzot went into hiding in June 1793. For several months, he lived in secret in various locations in France, aided by sympathizers who shared his views. However, in June 1794, he was betrayed by a former friend and discovered by the authorities. Facing certain arrest and execution, Buzot took his own life by stabbing himself with a knife. His death was seen as a symbol of the repression and violence of the Revolution, and he is remembered as a martyr of the Girondin cause.</p><p>Prior to his involvement in politics, François Buzot was a successful lawyer in Normandy. He was known for his eloquence and his defense of the poor and oppressed. Buzot was also an ardent supporter of the American Revolution and saw it as a model for France's own struggle for liberty and equality.</p><p>During his time in the National Convention, Buzot was a prolific writer and orator. He wrote extensively on the principles of democracy and human rights, and argued passionately for the preservation of individual freedoms in the face of the radicalism of the Jacobins.</p><p>Buzot's death was met with widespread outrage and his funeral became a rallying cry for the Girondin movement. Many saw him as a tragic figure, a victim of the violent excesses of the Revolution. In the years following his death, Buzot became an important symbol of resistance to tyranny and oppression.</p><p>Today, François Buzot is remembered as a key figure in the early years of the French Revolution and an advocate for democracy, human rights, and individual freedoms.</p><p>In addition to his political and legal work, François Buzot was also an accomplished musician and composer. He played the violin and composed several pieces of chamber music. Buzot's love of music was seen as a reflection of his belief in the importance of artistic expression and creativity in society.Throughout his life, Buzot remained committed to his ideals of democracy and freedom, even in the face of widespread persecution and violence. His unwavering dedication to these principles inspired many of his contemporaries and continues to inspire activists and intellectuals today.Buzot's tragic end remains a cautionary tale of the dangers of political extremism and the need for a balanced and inclusive approach to governance. Despite his untimely death, his legacy lives on as a symbol of the enduring struggle for human rights and social justice.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by suicide.

(April 28, 1928		Nice-June 6, 1962			Paris)


was
a French
artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>Klein was known for his unique style of art which was heavily influenced by his interest in spirituality and mysticism. He placed a great emphasis on the color blue, which he believed symbolized the infinite and the immaterial. He created a vivid blue pigment which he called International Klein Blue (IKB) and used it in his artwork. Klein's work has been exhibited around the world and he is considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. He was also a judo master and incorporated elements of martial arts into some of his performances.</p><p>Klein's interest in the concept of immateriality led him to develop a series of works known as "The Void" or "Le Vide," which consisted of empty gallery spaces that were painted entirely in IKB. He believed that this created a space where viewers could experience a sense of the infinite. </p><p>In addition to his work as an artist, Klein was also an influential figure in the development of performance art, and he frequently staged public actions and spectacles. One of his most famous works in this vein is "Anthropometries," in which nude models covered in IKB paint created imprints of their bodies on large sheets of paper, creating a kind of living painting.</p><p>Klein was greatly influenced by the work of the philosopher and mystic G.I. Gurdjieff, and he believed that art had the power to connect individuals with a higher spiritual reality. His work is characterized by a deep sense of spirituality and a desire to transcend the material world.</p><p>Klein's legacy has had a profound impact on the world of contemporary art, and his work continues to inspire and influence artists today. He is widely regarded as a pioneer of post-war European art, and his innovative use of color and form have made him one of the most important artists of the 20th century.</p><p>Klein's family was heavily involved in the art world, with his father being a well-known figurative painter and his grandfather owning a gallery in Nice. Klein was trained as a judo master and even opened his own dojo in Paris, where he trained with other famous artists such as Arman, Jean Tinguely, and Martial Raysse. He also briefly studied at the École Nationale Supérieure de la Photographie in Paris. </p><p>After developing his signature color and style, Klein gained notoriety in the art world with his first solo exhibition in Paris in 1957, titled "Yves: Propositions Monochromes," which featured a series of his works painted solely in IKB. In 1958, he exhibited his work in the United States and later traveled to Japan to further his understanding of Eastern spirituality.</p><p>In addition to his artwork and performance art pieces, Klein also wrote extensively on topics related to art and spirituality. He published two books, "Yves Klein: Le dépassement de la problématique de l'art" and "Les Fondements du Judo," the latter of which explored the philosophical and spiritual principles of the martial art.</p><p>Klein's work has been exhibited in major museums and galleries around the world, including the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Tate Modern in London. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of artists and his unique style and contributions to the world of contemporary art remain highly influential.</p><p></p><p>

a French
personality.


					</p><p>She was a prolific painter known for her portraiture and genre scenes, and was also a notable pupil of the Impressionist master, Edouard Manet. Born in Paris, Eva showed an early artistic talent and began studying painting at a young age. In 1869, she became a student of Manet's and quickly became one of his favorite pupils. It was said that he even considered her a sort of surrogate daughter, and the two had a close and affectionate relationship. After studying under Manet, Gonzales went on to have a career of her own, exhibiting her work with the Impressionists and winning recognition for her powerful portraits of young women. Sadly, her promising career was cut short when she died of childbirth complications at the young age of 34. Despite her short life, Gonzales had a significant impact on the art of her time and her legacy continues to be celebrated to this day.</p><p>Some of Gonzales' most well-known works include "Child with an Apple" and "The Convalescent." In addition to her painting, she was also a talented pianist and a lover of music, which is reflected in her artwork. Gonzales was also notable for breaking traditional gender roles by pursuing a career in art, which was not a common choice for women during her time. She was married to artist Henri Guérard, who was also a friend and colleague of Manet's. Despite her brief life and career, Gonzales made a significant contribution to the Impressionist movement and paved the way for future generations of female artists.</p><p>Gonzales' work was often noted for its sensitivity and attention to detail. Her portraits of women, in particular, were celebrated for their realism and emotional depth. She was also known for her use of color and light, which were hallmarks of the Impressionist movement. Her paintings often depicted everyday scenes and people, giving an insight into the lives of the working class during her time.</p><p>After her death, much of Gonzales' work was scattered or lost, but in recent years there has been a growing interest in her art. In 2018, the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris held a retrospective of her work, which drew significant attention from the art world. Today, Gonzales is remembered as one of the most talented artists of her generation, and her contributions to the Impressionist movement continue to be celebrated.</p><p></p><p>
