							Tom Payne developed a taste for theatre at an early age, and by the age of 18, he had already directed several plays. He later associated with the Independent Film Directors Association, where he met other film enthusiasts and made contacts in the film industry. Payne's directorial debut was in 1939, with the film "Avisos Importantes," and he went on to direct over 20 films throughout his career. He also wrote numerous screenplays, including the script for the film "Ha llegado un ángel" (An Angel has Arrived), which received several awards for its screenplay. In addition to his work in film, Payne was also a renowned theater actor, and he participated in several stage productions. Despite his impressive achievements in the film industry, Payne's contributions have been largely obscured by the Argentine dictatorship, which censored his films and suppressed their distribution during the 1970s. Nevertheless, his legacy lives on as a testament to the power of film to entertain and inspire audiences around the world.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=25546391" title="Wikipedia article about Tom Payne">Tom Payne on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/armenian-musicians-died-at-age-62.html' title='Armenian musicians died at age 62'><strong>Armenian musicians died at age 62</strong> List of the top 5 Armenian music stars who died when they were 62</a></li><li><a href='/south-korean-actors-died-in-1982.html' title='South Korean actors died in 1982'><strong>South Korean actors died in 1982</strong> List of the top 2 South Korean actors who died in 1982</a></li><li><a href='/swiss-musicians-died-at-age-37.html' title='Swiss musicians died at age 37'><strong>Swiss musicians died at age 37</strong> List of the top 2 Swiss music stars who died when they were 37</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/famous-actors-died-in-alcohol-intoxication.html' title='Famous actors died in Alcohol intoxication'><strong>Famous actors died in Alcohol intoxication</strong> List of the top 1 Famous actors who died in Alcohol intoxication</a></li><li><a href='/hongkongese-musicians-died-at-age-48.html' title='Hongkongese musicians died at age 48'><strong>Hongkongese musicians died at age 48</strong> List of the top 1 Hongkongese music stars who died when they were 48</a></li><li><a href='/american-actors-died-in-infectious-disease.html' title='American actors died in Infectious disease'><strong>American actors died in Infectious disease</strong> List of the top 1 American actors who died in Infectious disease</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
