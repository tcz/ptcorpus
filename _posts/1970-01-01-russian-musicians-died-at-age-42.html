									</h1><p>Here are 4 famous musicians from Russian Empire died at 42:</p><h2>Georgii Karpechenko</h2><p><strong>Georgii Karpechenko</strong>
(April 5, 1899		Velsk-July 28, 1941			Moscow Oblast)


was
a Russian
biologist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his groundbreaking work in the field of genetics and hybridization. Karpechenko studied at the Moscow Agricultural Institute and went on to work at the Institute of Applied Botany in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), where he conducted extensive research on the genetic hybridization of plants.</p><p>Karpechenko is credited with successfully crossing members of the Brassicaceae family, such as cabbage and radish, while working as a breeding scientist. His work paved the way for modern plant breeding methods and helped to increase crop yields and improve the quality of cultivated plants.</p><p>In addition to his work in genetics and botany, Karpechenko was also an advocate for science education in the Soviet Union. He worked to establish botanical gardens and research institutes throughout the country and helped to train a new generation of scientists.</p><p>Tragically, Karpechenko's promising career was cut short when he was arrested by the Soviet secret police during the Stalinist purges of the 1930s. He was imprisoned for several years before being released, but his health had deteriorated and he died in 1941. However, his contributions to the field of genetics and plant breeding continue to be celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>

					</p><p>Gogol was born in a small village in Ukraine and later moved to Saint Petersburg where he studied at the School of Higher Art. He became famous for his portrayal of Ukrainian and Russian rural life in his early works, such as "Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka" and "Mirgorod". However, it was his novel "Dead Souls" that brought him critical acclaim and permanent fame. The book tells the story of a conman who buys up the "souls" of deceased serfs to use them as collateral for loans.</p><p>Gogol's writings often blended elements of the macabre, surreal, and grotesque with social satire and commentary on the human condition. He also wrote several plays, including the famous "The Inspector General", which is still regularly performed today. Despite his success, Gogol was deeply troubled by his own writing and suffered from depression and religious angst. He spent his final years traveling and seeking spiritual guidance, but ultimately died in tragic circumstances.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of starvation.
