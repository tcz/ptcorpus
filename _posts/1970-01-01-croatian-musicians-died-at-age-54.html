(October 3, 1891		Belišće-February 17, 1946			Zagreb)

	
		also known as Baron Viktor Gutmann von Gelse und Belišće

	
was
a Croatian
nobleman and industrialist.


					</p><p>He was born to a wealthy family of Jewish descent in the town of Belišće in what is now Croatia. Gutmann studied engineering in Vienna and then worked for several years in the United States before returning to Croatia to take over his family's paper factory. </p><p>Under Gutmann's leadership, the factory prospered and became one of the largest employers in the region. He was also involved in politics, serving as a member of parliament for several years in the 1920s and 1930s. </p><p>However, when the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, Gutmann was arrested and sent to a concentration camp. He managed to survive and was eventually released, but his health had been severely damaged. He died in Zagreb in 1946, just a year after the end of World War II. </p><p>Gutmann's legacy lives on through the numerous philanthropic contributions he made throughout his life. One of his major philanthropic initiatives was the establishment of a hospital in Belišće that was open to all, regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>In addition to his business and political pursuits, Gutmann was also an art collector and patron. He collected contemporary European art and displayed it in his family's estate in Belišće. He also commissioned works by several Croatian artists, including the painter Edo Kovačević. Gutmann's collection was eventually confiscated by the Nazis during their occupation of Croatia, but many pieces were later recovered and are now housed in Croatian galleries and museums. </p><p>Gutmann's tragic fate at the hands of the Nazis is a reminder of the atrocities committed against Jewish people during World War II. However, his impact on his community and country extended far beyond his own life. The hospital he established in Belišće continued to operate for decades after his death, providing quality medical care to the people of the region. Today, Gutmann is remembered as a successful businessman, a devoted philanthropist, and a victim of Nazi persecution.</p><p></p><p>
