(November 18, 1933		Little Rock-November 8, 1991			New York City)


was
an American
composer, artist, musician and music artist.


						</p><p>She was best known for her work as a performance artist, particularly in the field of avant-garde and experimental music. Moorman was a classically trained cellist but became known for performing on a variety of electronic and unconventional instruments, including the TV Cello, which she created by attaching television sets to a traditional cello. </p><p>Moorman was a well-known figure in the New York City art scene during the 1960s and 70s and collaborated with many notable artists and musicians, including Nam June Paik, John Cage, and Yoko Ono. She was also the founder and director of the Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York, which ran from 1963 until 1980 and featured performances by both established and emerging artists. </p><p>Throughout her career, Moorman pushed the boundaries of traditional performance art and incorporated her own body into her performances, often performing in provocative ways that challenged societal norms and expectations. Despite facing censorship and legal challenges for her work, Moorman continued to create and perform until her death from cancer in 1991. Today, she is considered a pioneer of performance art and an important figure in the development of avant-garde music and art.</p><p>Moorman was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, but grew up in Jackson, Mississippi. She attended the University of Texas and later the University of Illinois, where she received her master's degree in music. After moving to New York City in 1961, Moorman quickly became involved in the avant-garde art scene and began collaborating with other artists on experimental projects. She first gained recognition for her work with the Fluxus movement, a group of artists who sought to blur the boundaries between art and everyday life.</p><p>In addition to her work as a performer and artist, Moorman was also a passionate advocate for experimental art and music. She worked tirelessly to promote emerging artists and musicians, often organizing and producing their shows herself. Moorman's commitment to the avant-garde earned her the nickname "the Jeanne d'Arc of new music."</p><p>Moorman's influence on the art world can still be felt today. Her pioneering work in performance art has inspired countless artists, and her commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable in art and music continues to inspire new generations of creatives. In 2014, the Queens Museum in New York City held a retrospective exhibit of Moorman's work, cementing her place in art history as a pioneering figure in the avant-garde.</p><p></p><p>
