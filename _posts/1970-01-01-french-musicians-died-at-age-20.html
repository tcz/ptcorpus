(June 18, 1903		Saint-Maur-des-Fossés-December 12, 1923			Paris)


was
a French
novelist and writer.


					</p><p>Despite his short life, Radiguet wrote a number of influential works and is considered a significant figure of the literary movement known as the "Lost Generation". His most famous work is the novel "Le Diable au corps" ("The Devil in the Flesh"), which was published when he was just 17 years old and caused a scandal due to its explicit themes. Radiguet was also associated with prominent artists and writers of his time, including Jean Cocteau and Pablo Picasso. Even today, his writing continues to be celebrated for its striking style and exploration of taboo topics.</p><p>Radiguet was born to a middle-class family but his parents' divorce when he was four years old made his childhood difficult. He dropped out of school at the age of 14 and started working for a bookseller. In 1919, at the age of 16, he met the famous writer and artist, Jean Cocteau, who became his mentor and close friend. Cocteau recognized Radiguet's talent and helped him publish his first poems and stories in several magazines.</p><p>"The Devil in the Flesh" was published in 1923 and became an instant success, selling over 100,000 copies in a year. The novel was controversial due to its depiction of a young boy's passionate love affair with a married woman during World War I. Some critics condemned it as immoral, while others praised it for its honesty and boldness. Despite the controversy, the novel helped to establish Radiguet as a major new voice in French literature.</p><p>Sadly, Radiguet's life was cut short when he contracted typhus during a trip to Morocco with Cocteau. He died in Paris a few days after returning, at the age of 20. His early death cut short a promising career, but his impact on French literature cannot be denied. His work has inspired many writers, and his legacy lives on today.</p><p>After Radiguet's death, Jean Cocteau mourned him deeply and wrote a eulogy that was published in a Parisian newspaper. In it, Cocteau referred to Radiguet as his "son, brother, and friend" and praised his talent as a writer. Cocteau also helped to edit and publish Radiguet's unfinished novel, "Vers l'autre flamme" ("Toward Another Flame"), which was released posthumously in 1924.Radiguet's influence can be seen in the work of many French writers who came after him, including Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Françoise Sagan. In addition, his life and work have been the subject of several biographies and films, including the 1977 movie "Le Diable au corps" directed by Marco Bellocchio. Today, Radiguet is remembered as one of the most important figures of 20th-century French literature, whose innovative style and provocative subject matter continue to captivate readers around the world.</p><p>Radiguet's early works were heavily influenced by Cocteau's surrealism and avant-garde style. However, as he grew more confident in his own voice, Radiguet developed a distinct style characterized by sparse, straightforward prose and frank, sometimes shocking subject matter. His writing often explored themes of love, death, and morality, and was marked by its willingness to confront taboo topics head-on.</p><p>In addition to his literary pursuits, Radiguet was also a talented artist and musician. He played several instruments, including the piano and saxophone, and was known to compose his own music. Radiguet's love for the arts brought him into contact with some of the most influential artists and thinkers of his time, including Picasso, Sergei Diaghilev, and Guillaume Apollinaire.</p><p>Despite his short life, Radiguet left behind a body of work that continues to be studied and admired by readers and scholars alike. His influence on French literature, and on the broader cultural landscape of the 20th century, cannot be overstated.</p><p>Radiguet's impact on the literary scene was significant, given that he was only active for a few years during which he published just two novels, a handful of short stories, and some poems. However, his writing was praised for its unique voice, which was unflinching in its depiction of human emotions and desires. In addition to his literary legacy, Radiguet's personal life also garnered attention from historians and biographers alike. He was known for his charismatic personality and his scandalous affairs, including a rumored fling with the actress Jeanne Hébuterne, who later became the muse of Amedeo Modigliani. Despite the controversies surrounding his life and work, Radiguet remains an iconic figure in French literature and an inspiration to generations of artists and writers who have followed in his footsteps.</p><p>Radiguet's impact on the literary world was not limited to his own writing. He was also a significant influence on his mentor, Jean Cocteau, who praised Radiguet's work and helped him gain recognition in literary circles. Cocteau referred to Radiguet as his "son" and saw him as a kind of literary heir. Radiguet's style and themes can be seen in Cocteau's later work, and the two collaborated on several projects, including the film "The Blood of a Poet."Radiguet's posthumous influence on French literature cannot be overstated. His innovative style and daring subject matter continue to inspire writers today. Even outside of France, Radiguet's impact can be felt. His work has been translated into many languages, and his life and legacy have been the subject of study by scholars around the world. He is remembered as a poet, novelist, musician, and cultural icon whose contributions to modern literature will never be forgotten.</p><p></p><p>
