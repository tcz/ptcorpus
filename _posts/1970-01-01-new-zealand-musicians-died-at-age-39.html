(January 5, 1910		Crushington-December 28, 1949			New York City)


was
a New Zealand
personality.


					</p><p>Lovelock was a middle-distance runner who famously won the gold medal in the 1500 meters at the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin, Germany. He was a gifted athlete who also set world records in the mile and 1500 meters. Lovelock was highly regarded for his intellect in addition to his athleticism, obtaining a degree in medicine and a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University. He went on to become a medical doctor and was in the United States working as a research scientist when he tragically died at the young age of 39 from a heart attack. Lovelock's accomplishments in sport and academics continue to inspire many in his home country and around the world.</p><p>Despite being born and raised in New Zealand, Jack Lovelock's family roots traced back to the British Isles. Lovelock initially gained attention as an athlete during his college years. He attended both Canterbury and Otago Universities, earning degrees in physical education and medicine. At the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he represented New Zealand in the 1500m event, but finished seventh in his heat, failing to advance to the final.</p><p>Despite this early setback, Lovelock continued to train and improve his fitness, working on his running style and technique with coach Arthur Lydiard. In 1936, he traveled to Europe to compete in various track meets, including the Olympics. There, he shocked the world by winning the 1500m final with a record-breaking time of 3:47:8. His victory was particularly significant given the political context of the time, as Adolf Hitler was in power and had sought to use the Games to promote Nazi ideology.</p><p>Following his triumph, Lovelock returned to New Zealand briefly before leaving for Oxford, where he studied politics, philosophy, and economics as a Rhodes Scholar. He continued to compete in athletics during his time in England, setting world records in the mile and 1500m. After completing his studies, Lovelock spent several years practicing medicine in London before eventually moving to the United States in 1947 to work as a medical researcher.</p><p>Lovelock continued to be involved in athletics throughout his life, serving as a commentator and coach at various events. He was also an accomplished writer, publishing a number of articles and essays on topics ranging from medicine to philosophy. Sadly, his life was cut short when he suffered a fatal heart attack in his New York City laboratory in 1949. Lovelock's legacy lives on, however, as a symbol of both sporting excellence and intellectual curiosity.</p><p></p><p>
