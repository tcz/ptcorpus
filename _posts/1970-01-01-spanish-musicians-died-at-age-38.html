Ferdinand was also a poet and knight, known for his participation in the Battle of Montecatini in 1315. He had a close relationship with his brother and fellow poet, King Sancho of Majorca. However, their relationship was strained due to Ferdinand's ambition to rule over Sardinia, which Sancho reserved for himself.

His most famous work is the "Cant de la Sibil·la," a song about the Day of Judgment that is still performed in Majorca's Cathedral of Santa Maria.</p><p>In addition to his literary pursuits, Ferdinand was also a skilled warrior. He fought in several battles, including the War of the Sicilian Vespers, which pitted the Kingdom of Aragon against the Angevins for control of Sicily. His bravery on the battlefield earned him the nickname "The Valiant."</p><p>Ferdinand's death was a significant blow to the House of Barcelona, as he was one of the most promising members of the family. However, his memory lived on, and he was often remembered as a tragic hero who sacrificed his life for his ideals. Today, he is celebrated in Majorca's literature and folklore as a symbol of the island's rich cultural history.</p><p>Ferdinand's passion for culture extended beyond poetry, as he was also known for his patronage of architecture and the fine arts. He commissioned the construction of the Palau de l'Almudaina, a Gothic-style palace in Palma that still stands today as a symbol of Majorca's architectural heritage. Ferdinand was also a patron of painting and sculpture, and he was known to have commissioned several works from local artists during his reign. </p><p>Despite his ambitions to conquer Sardinia, Ferdinand was also deeply committed to his native Majorca. He was a devout Catholic and a benefactor of the Church, and he founded the Convent of San Francisco in Palma. He also worked to improve the lives of the island's residents, implementing policies to support agriculture and trade.</p><p>Ferdinand's tragic ending, captured and executed by the King of Aragon, has been the subject of numerous works throughout history, from plays to historical novels. His death marked a turning point in the history of the House of Barcelona, as it shifted the balance of power in favor of Aragon. However, Ferdinand's legacy as a poet, patron of the arts, and valiant warrior has ensured that he remains an enduring figure in Majorca's rich cultural history.</p><p></p><p>
