									</h1><p>Here are 2 famous musicians from Italy died at 21:</p><h2>Goffredo Mameli</h2><p><strong>Goffredo Mameli</strong>
(September 5, 1827		Genoa-July 6, 1849			Rome)


was
an Italian
poet.


					</p><p>He is best known for writing the lyrics of the Italian national anthem, "Fratelli d'Italia" (Brothers of Italy), which he composed in 1847. Mameli was also a fervent patriot and nationalist, and he fought in the ranks of Giuseppe Garibaldi's army during the campaigns to unify Italy. Mameli was deeply involved in the political and cultural movements of his time, and he wrote numerous poems and essays on subjects ranging from history and literature to social and political issues. Despite his brief life, Mameli played a pivotal role in the shaping of modern Italian identity, and he is still celebrated as a national hero and cultural icon in Italy today.</p><p>Mameli was born into a middle-class family in Genoa and received an excellent education, particularly in literature and history. He inherited his father's passion for republican ideals and nationalism, and these values permeated much of his writing. Mameli was deeply affected by the turmoil that swept through Italy in the mid-19th century, and he saw the struggle for Italian independence and unification as a vital cause that would require the full commitment of all Italians.</p><p>Mameli's most enduring accomplishment, the writing of "Fratelli d'Italia," came in the wake of the revolutions of 1848, which had spread throughout Europe and led to widespread political unrest in Italy. The song quickly became a rallying cry for Italian nationalists, as Mameli's stirring words celebrated Italian identity and unity in the face of foreign domination. Even today, "Fratelli d'Italia" remains a beloved and recognizable song, sung on national holidays and sporting events across Italy.</p><p>Despite his patriotic fervor, Mameli's life was tragically brief. He died at the age of 22 from a wound sustained during a skirmish on the walls of Rome, where he was fighting alongside Garibaldi's forces to defend the newly-formed Roman Republic against French invasion. Nevertheless, his legacy lived on, and even during his lifetime, Mameli was hailed as a hero and an inspiration to the cause of Italian independence. Today, he is remembered as a key figure in the Risorgimento movement, which helped to cement Italy's position as a unified and independent nation.</p><p>In addition to his work as a poet and nationalist, Goffredo Mameli was also active in political circles during his brief life. He joined the secret society known as La Giovine Italia (Young Italy), founded by Giuseppe Mazzini, which aimed to promote Italian independence and sovereignty. Mameli was also a member of the Carbonari, a revolutionary organization that sought to overthrow foreign rulers in Italy.</p><p>Mameli's writings and legacy continue to inspire Italian nationalists and patriots today. He is celebrated as a symbol of Italy's struggle for independence and unification, and his contributions to Italian literature and culture have ensured his lasting place in the country's history. Several streets and squares across Italy have been named after Mameli, and his statue stands in front of the Italian parliament in Rome.</p><p></p><p>
