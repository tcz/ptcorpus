politician.


					</p><p>Karmal was a prominent figure in the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and was the president of Afghanistan from 1979 to 1986. He was seen as a controversial leader due to his alignment with the Soviet Union and his policies, which were met with opposition from various groups within Afghanistan. Karmal's presidency saw a period of great turmoil, with the country being plunged into a long and bloody civil war. Despite being ousted from power and eventually exiled to the Soviet Union, Karmal continued to play a significant role in Afghan politics until his death in 1996.</p><p></p><p>

an Afghan
personality.


					</p><p>He was the King of Afghanistan from 1919 to 1929, and again from 1929 until he abdicated in 1929. During his reign, he implemented many modernization and reforms, including the establishment of a constitution and a centralized government. He also worked to improve education, healthcare, and women's rights. Amānullāh Khān was known for his strong personality and his dedication to modernizing and westernizing Afghanistan.
