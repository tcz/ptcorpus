(April 7, 1927		Nova Friburgo-May 3, 2004			Rio de Janeiro)

	
		a.k.a. Lygia Pape

	
was
a Brazilian
personality.


					</p><p>She was a visual artist, sculptor, painter, engraver, and filmmaker. Pape was one of the pioneers of the Neo-Concrete movement in Brazil, which sought to explore the relationships between art and the spectator in a more interactive and participatory way. She was also known for her experimental films, which often used abstract images and unconventional editing techniques. Pape's artwork has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate Modern in London. Today, she is remembered for her contributions to the Brazilian and international art scenes, and her legacy continues to inspire new generations of artists.</p><p>Pape's early works were primarily abstract paintings and structures. She was a founding member of the Concrete and Neo-Concrete movement in Rio de Janeiro during the 1950s and 1960s. She played a pivotal role in the formation of the Grupo Frente, which opposed the traditional painting styles of local artists. In the 1960s, Pape produced some of her most important and recognized works, the Livro da Criação series, which explored the interaction between the public and art through mediums such as sculpture, installation, and performance. </p><p>Aside from her work in the visual arts, Pape was also known for her contributions to Brazilian theater and cinema. She collaborated with filmmaker Glauber Rocha, creating innovative films like "The Mysteries of Amazonas" (1974) and "Inverse Impressions" (1981). In recognition of her contributions to the Brazilian art world, Pape was awarded the Order of Cultural Merit by the Brazilian government in 1999, shortly before her passing in 2004.</p><p>Pape's legacy continues to inspire new generations of artists all over the world. In recent years, her work has been the subject of several high-profile solo exhibitions, including shows at the Serpentine Galleries in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Museu de Arte Contemporânea in São Paulo. In addition to her groundbreaking work, Pape was also an advocate for social justice and political change, and she used her art to speak out against authoritarianism and repression in Brazil. Today, her work is seen as a testament to the power of art to effect change and inspire new ways of thinking. Pape's influence on contemporary art and culture is undeniable, and her contributions to the Neo-Concrete movement in particular continue to shape the landscape of Brazilian art and beyond.</p><p>Pape’s style was heavily influenced by her interest in geometry and the mathematical concepts of space and form. This interest is evident in her sculptures, which often feature intricate and complex shapes that challenge the viewer’s perception of space and dimension. One of her most famous sculptures, "Ttéia" (Web), was a large-scale installation made up of delicate golden threads that gave the impression of a shimmering, three-dimensional web. Pape’s exploration of space and form extended beyond sculpture and into her experimentation with film as well. Her films took on a abstract quality that challenged traditional cinematic techniques and aimed to create an immersive and interactive experience for the viewer. </p><p>Pape also had a deep interest in the cultural traditions of Brazil and drew upon them in her work. She explored the rich diversity of Brazilian folk culture, religious practices, and indigenous art, often incorporating elements of these traditions into her pieces. Her commitment to using art to explore cultural identity and national heritage was a key aspect of her Neo-Concrete practice. </p><p>Throughout her life, Pape remained committed to the idea that art can be a tool for social change. She was a member of the resistance movement against Brazil’s military dictatorship and used her art to speak out against political oppression and censorship. Her belief that art can foster new ways of thinking and inspire profound social and political transformation has made her a figure of great significance in Brazilian art history. Today, Pape is celebrated as one of Brazil’s most important artists and is remembered not only for her groundbreaking work, but also for her unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of what art can achieve.</p><p></p><p>
