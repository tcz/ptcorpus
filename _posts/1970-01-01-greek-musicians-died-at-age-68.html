(April 5, 1878		Athens-October 26, 1946			Ampelokipoi, Athens)


was
a Greek
politician and lawyer.


					</p><p>He served as the Prime Minister of Greece three times, first from 1943 to 1944 during the German occupation of Greece, then briefly in 1945, and finally from 1946 until his death later that year. Rallis was known for his conservative and authoritarian politics, and was criticized for his collaboration with the German occupation forces during World War II. Despite this, he remained a popular figure among some sections of society, particularly on the right wing of Greek politics. Prior to his political career, Rallis had a successful legal practice and was known for his work as a barrister.</p><p>In addition to his political and legal work, Ioannis Rallis was also a prolific writer and contributed to several newspapers and magazines throughout his career. He was a supporter of the Greek monarchy and served as the Minister of Justice during the regime of George II. Rallis was also a member of the Poros Academy, a literary society founded by his father, Georgios Rallis, which aimed to promote Greek culture and literature. His political legacy remains controversial, with some seeing him as a collaborator and others as a patriot who did what was necessary to protect Greece during a difficult time in its history.</p><p>During his first term as Prime Minister from 1943 to 1944, Rallis was appointed by the Germans to lead a collaborationist government, known as the Security Battalions. This government was known for its brutal treatment of civilians and political opponents, and is widely regarded as a stain on Greece's history. Following the defeat of the Axis powers in World War II, Rallis was briefly exiled to the island of Syros before returning to Greece to serve as Prime Minister for a second term in 1945.</p><p>During his final term as Prime Minister in 1946, Rallis faced significant challenges, including a civil war between communist and government forces, economic instability, and social unrest. Despite these challenges, he remained committed to his conservative policies and sought to create a stable government that could restore order and rebuild the country after years of war and occupation.</p><p>Rallis' death in October 1946 came as a shock to many Greeks, and his funeral was attended by thousands of mourners. Despite his controversial legacy, many Greeks continue to view Rallis as a pivotal figure in their country's history, with some seeing him as a flawed but dedicated leader who worked tirelessly to protect Greece during a time of great turmoil and upheaval.</p><p>During his time as Prime Minister, Rallis was also involved in the negotiations surrounding the Treaty of Peace with Italy, which was signed in February 1947. He was instrumental in securing Greek territorial claims in the Dodecanese Islands and played a significant role in the establishment of the Greek Communist Party as an illegal organization. Rallis was supportive of the monarchy and believed that it was essential for maintaining political stability in Greece. However, his government was also criticized for its human rights abuses, including the imprisonment and torture of political dissidents.</p><p>Rallis came from a prominent political family - his father, Georgios Rallis, was also a politician who served as Prime Minister of Greece from 1921 to 1922. Following in his father's footsteps, Rallis was active in politics from a young age and was known for his intelligence and rhetorical skills. He studied law at the University of Athens and worked as a barrister before entering politics.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Rallis remains an important figure in Greek history and is remembered for his contributions to the country's political and cultural life. His writings on Greek history and culture continue to be studied and debated, and his role in shaping the country's post-war development remains a subject of intense interest to historians and political scientists.</p><p></p><p>
