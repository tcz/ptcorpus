					</p><p>He was born in Amoy (now known as Xiamen), China and started his formal art education in Xiamen in 1928.

He taught at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts from 1947 to 1960 and was also a founding member of the Singapore Watercolour Society. Cheong's contributions to the development of art in Singapore have earned him a place among the country's most celebrated artists.</p><p>Despite being born in China, Cheong Soo Pieng was considered a prominent figure in the development of art in Singapore. His journey in art began in 1928 when he attended the Amoy Art School in Xiamen. Cheong was trained in traditional Chinese painting techniques, which he later fused with the contemporary elements of the Nanyang style. He moved to Singapore after WWII and became a full-time artist. His works began to draw attention in the 1950s when he held his first solo exhibition at the British Council in Singapore. In 1952, he became one of the first local artists to receive an overseas scholarship to study art in Paris. Apart from Chinese and Southeast Asian themes, Cheong was inspired by the diverse cultures of Bali and New Guinea, which he reflected in his works. In 1969, he was awarded Singapore's Cultural Medallion for his contribution to the arts. His legacy has been preserved through fellow artists and the establishment of the Cheong Soo Pieng Memorial Fund, which provides scholarships to emerging artists in Singapore.</p><p></p><p>
