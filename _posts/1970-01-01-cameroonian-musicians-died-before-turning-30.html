		also known as Marc-Vivien Foe

	
was
a Cameroonian
football player.


					</p><p>Foé began his professional football career in Cameroon before being signed by French club Lens in 1994. He quickly established himself as one of the most promising African players, attracting  the attentions of Lyon, who signed him for a then-record fee for a Cameroon player in 2000. </p><p>Foé played an integral role in the Cameroon national team's triumph in the 2000 African Cup of Nations, and later represented his country in the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan. He scored two goals during the tournament, including a crucial equalizer against Saudi Arabia in the opening match. </p><p>Tragically, Foé collapsed during a Confederations Cup semi-final match between Cameroon and Colombia on June 26, 2003. Despite the best efforts of doctors at the stadium and later in hospital, he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Foé's death led to an outpouring of grief from fans and players around the world, and he is still remembered as one of Cameroon's greatest players.</p><p>Foé's death prompted FIFA to introduce mandatory heart screenings for all professional football players, in an effort to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future. In addition to his successes on the field, Foé was known for his friendly and sociable personality off the field. He was deeply committed to charitable causes, and often used his celebrity to raise awareness about issues affecting his home country of Cameroon, such as poverty and HIV/AIDS. After his death, his family and friends founded the Marc-Vivien Foé Foundation, which works to support children from disadvantaged backgrounds in Cameroon. Foé's legacy lives on not only through his impressive football career, but through the charitable work he inspired and the lasting impact he had on football culture around the world.</p><p>Foé's death came as a great shock to both the footballing community and the wider world. In honor of his memory, Lyon retired the number 17 shirt that Foé wore during his time with the club, and a statue of him was erected in his hometown of Yaoundé. In addition, the Confederations Cup trophy was later renamed the FIFA Confederations Cup Marc-Vivien Foé Trophy in his honor. Foé's death also prompted an investigation into the state of medical care in football, and led to increased scrutiny of the long-term effects of the sport on player health. Despite the tragedy of his untimely death, Foé's legacy continues to inspire generations of footballers and fans around the world.</p><p>Foé's sudden death at the age of 28 sent shockwaves through the international football community. During the Confederations Cup match against Colombia at the Stade de Gerland in Lyon, Foé collapsed in the center circle without any contact with other players. Medical staff quickly attended to him on the field and attempted to resuscitate him with a defibrillator, but their efforts were unsuccessful. He was then rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. The exact cause of his death was later attributed to a rare heart condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which had gone undetected despite Foé having passed multiple medical examinations throughout his career. </p><p>Foé was survived by his wife and three children. In addition to his footballing achievements, he is remembered for his kind and generous spirit, his unwavering dedication to his country and community, and his infectious smile. To this day, his death remains a tragic reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of regular health screenings, especially for athletes in high-stress environments. Despite the sorrow of his passing, Foé's legacy endures and continues to inspire young footballers from around the world.</p><p></p><p>
