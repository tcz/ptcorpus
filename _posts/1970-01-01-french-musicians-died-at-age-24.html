(June 23, 1907		Harbin-April 13, 1932			7th arrondissement)

	
		also known as Pierre Batchef or Piotr Bacev

	
was
a French
actor.


					</p><p>Pierre Batcheff was born in Harbin, China to a family of Russian émigrés. He grew up in France and began his acting career in the 1920s. He is best known for his role as the young man in the surrealist film "Un Chien Andalou," directed by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí. Batcheff also appeared in other French films including "La Coquille et le Clergyman" and "Les Mystères de Paris." Despite his promising career, Batcheff suffered from depression and financial struggles. He tragically committed suicide at the young age of 24, leaving behind a wife and young daughter. His early death, as well as his important contribution to surrealism, earned him a place in the annals of film history.</p><p>Batcheff's life was not only marked by his acting career but also by his personal relationships. He was involved in a passionate relationship with the French author and artist Renée Riese, who also happened to be the wife of his close friend and fellow surrealist artist Max Ernst. Batcheff's death had a profound impact on Riese, who later wrote a book about their relationship and his tragic suicide.</p><p>Batcheff's role in "Un Chien Andalou" was particularly memorable and influential, as the film became a cornerstone of the surrealist movement. His character's eyes being sliced open by a razor in the movie's opening scene is one of the most iconic images in film history. Batcheff's performance in the film has been praised for its dreamlike quality and its ability to capture the surrealist ethos of the time.</p><p>Despite his brief career, Batcheff remains a significant figure in both the history of French cinema and the surrealist movement. His performances were marked by a unique blend of sensitivity and intensity, which set him apart from many of his contemporaries. His legacy continues to inspire generations of artists and filmmakers today.</p><p></p><p>
