(April 5, 2015		Tikrit-March 30, 1971			Kuwait)


was
an Iraqi
politician.


					</p><p>He was a member of the Ba'ath Party and served as a senior advisor to Saddam Hussein. Al-Tikriti also held several high-level positions in the Iraqi government, including Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Agriculture, and Minister of Trade. He was considered one of Saddam Hussein's closest confidants and played a key role in the regime's activities, including the suppression of political opposition. His assassination in Kuwait in 1971 was believed to have been carried out by members of the Iraqi opposition.</p><p>Hardan al-Tikriti was born on April 5, 1935, in Tikrit, Iraq. He started his political career as a member of the Ba'ath Party's student organization in the late 1950s. Al-Tikriti quickly rose through the ranks of the party and became a close ally of Saddam Hussein in the 1960s.</p><p>In 1968, when the Ba'ath Party seized power in Iraq, Al-Tikriti became a key figure in the new government. He held several high-level positions, including Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Agriculture, and Minister of Trade. He was also a member of the Revolutionary Command Council, the highest decision-making body in Iraq.</p><p>Al-Tikriti's close relationship with Saddam Hussein led to him becoming a senior advisor to the Iraqi president. He played a crucial role in the regime's activities, including the suppression of political opposition, and was known for his fierce loyalty to Saddam Hussein.</p><p>In 1971, Al-Tikriti was assassinated in Kuwait. The assassination was believed to have been carried out by members of the Iraqi opposition, who were opposed to the Ba'ath Party's regime. His death was a significant loss to the Iraqi government and Saddam Hussein, who regarded Al-Tikriti as one of his closest confidants.</p><p>After Al-Tikriti's death, the Iraqi government accused the Kuwaiti government of being involved in the assassination. This led to increased tensions between the two countries, and Iraq later invaded Kuwait in 1990.</p><p>Al-Tikriti's legacy in Iraq is mixed. While he was seen as a loyal confidant of Saddam Hussein and played a significant role in the regime's suppression of political opposition, he is also remembered for his contributions to the country's agricultural and trade policies. Some members of the Ba'ath Party still view him as a hero and continue to honor his memory.</p><p>Today, Al-Tikriti's hometown of Tikrit is known for being the birthplace of both Saddam Hussein and several other high-ranking members of his regime, including Al-Tikriti himself. The city was heavily damaged during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and has since struggled to rebuild its infrastructure and economy.</p><p>Hardan al-Tikriti's assassination in Kuwait in 1971 was a significant event in the history of Iraq and the Middle East. His death was seen as a blow to Saddam Hussein's regime, and it is believed that it was a turning point in Iraq's relations with Kuwait. Al-Tikriti's assassination was one of several events that set the stage for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.</p><p>Al-Tikriti's contributions to Iraq's agricultural and trade policies during his time as Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Trade were significant. He played a crucial role in improving Iraq's food security and promoting its agricultural exports. He helped establish the Iraqi Grain Board and other institutions that helped modernize Iraq's agricultural sector.</p><p>However, Al-Tikriti's legacy is inextricably linked to Saddam Hussein's regime and its brutal tactics. His involvement in the regime's suppression of political opposition and the use of violence to maintain power has drawn criticism from many quarters.</p><p>Despite his controversial legacy, Al-Tikriti remains a significant figure in Iraq's history. His assassination and the events surrounding it continue to be the subject of scholarly and political debate.</p><p>Thank you for providing such a comprehensive bio of Hardan al-Tikriti. It is worth noting that some sources indicate that his assassination in Kuwait in 1971 was not only carried out by members of the Iraqi opposition but also involved elements within the ruling Ba'ath Party who viewed al-Tikriti as a potential rival to Saddam Hussein. Additionally, al-Tikriti's family has reportedly denied that he was a member of the Ba'ath Party and has suggested that his loyalty was to Iraq rather than any particular political party or individual. Regardless of these debates, al-Tikriti's life and death continue to be studied and analyzed for their impact on Iraq's political history.</p><p></p><p>
