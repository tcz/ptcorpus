							Born in Yokohama, Japan, Sayoko Yamaguchi started her modeling career in the 1970s and quickly became an iconic figure in the fashion world. She worked for major fashion brands such as Yves Saint Laurent, Hermès, Kenzo, and Issey Miyake. In addition to modeling, she also pursued other creative endeavors, including acting and costume designing for film and theater productions. She broke barriers and paved the way for other Asian models to enter the industry, becoming one of the first Asian models to achieve international recognition. Yamaguchi's unique look – a combination of her Japanese heritage and her Western education – helped her stand out in a predominantly white industry. She was known for her androgynous appearance, often modeling menswear alongside female fashion. In later years, she became an advocate for environmental causes, participating in campaigns to raise awareness on issues such as deforestation, climate change, and species extinction.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=12864622" title="Wikipedia article about Sayoko Yamaguchi">Sayoko Yamaguchi on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/austrian-actresses-died-at-age-71.html' title='Austrian actresses died at age 71'><strong>Austrian actresses died at age 71</strong> List of the top 2 Austrian actresses who died when they were 71</a></li><li><a href='/russian-musicians-died-at-age-44.html' title='Russian musicians died at age 44'><strong>Russian musicians died at age 44</strong> List of the top 2 Russian music stars who died when they were 44</a></li><li><a href='/english-actresses-born-in-1933.html' title='English actresses born in 1933'><strong>English actresses born in 1933</strong> List of the top 5 English actresses who were born in 1933</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/polish-actresses-born-in-1983.html' title='Polish actresses born in 1983'><strong>Polish actresses born in 1983</strong> List of the top 11 Polish actresses who were born in 1983</a></li><li><a href='/indian-actresses-died-in-1991.html' title='Indian actresses died in 1991'><strong>Indian actresses died in 1991</strong> List of the top 3 Indian actresses who died in 1991</a></li><li><a href='/danish-actresses-died-in-1962.html' title='Danish actresses died in 1962'><strong>Danish actresses died in 1962</strong> List of the top 3 Danish actresses who died in 1962</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
