(April 5, 2015		Odessa-April 5, 1989)


was
an Israeli
personality.


					</p><p>Avigdor Stematsky was a prominent Israeli artist and one of the pioneers of Israeli abstract art. He immigrated to Palestine in 1925 at the age of 10 and later studied at the Bezalel School of Art and Design in Jerusalem. As a member of the New Horizons group, he was instrumental in the development of abstract art in Israel during the 1950s and 1960s. His work has been exhibited extensively in Israel and internationally, and is held in numerous public and private collections. In addition to his artistic practice, Stematsky was also a respected teacher, and taught at a number of art schools in Israel throughout his career.</p><p>Stematsky's style is characterized by its use of bold colors and geometric forms, often inspired by the landscapes and colors of his childhood memories in Odessa. He was particularly known for his use of the color blue, which he believed represented the essence of the Israeli landscape. Stematsky received numerous awards throughout his career, including the Dizengoff Prize for Painting in 1959 and the Israel Prize for Painting in 1984. Today, his paintings are considered iconic examples of Israeli abstract art, and his influence can be seen in the work of many contemporary Israeli artists.</p><p>Stematsky's passion for art began at a young age, and he went on to study at the Bezalel School of Art and Design in Jerusalem under the tutelage of Boris Schatz, the founder of the school. He later studied in Paris, where he was exposed to the work of European modernists such as Wassily Kandinsky and Kazimir Malevich, who greatly influenced his artistic style.</p><p>In addition to his career as an artist and teacher, Stematsky was also a writer and poet. He collaborated with many of the leading writers and poets of his time, including the poet Yair Hurvitz, with whom he published two books of poetry.</p><p>Stematsky's legacy continues to be celebrated through his artwork, which is recognized for its bold and innovative use of color and form. He is remembered as a pioneer of Israeli abstract art, whose influence can still be seen in the work of contemporary artists today.</p><p>Stematsky's work was heavily influenced by the landscapes and colors of Israel, where he spent much of his life. He often painted views of the Mediterranean Sea and the desert, translating the vibrant colors into his work. In his later years, he also experimented with collage, incorporating elements such as sand and leaves into his paintings. </p><p>Stematsky's contribution to Israeli art was widely recognized in his lifetime, with numerous exhibitions held both in Israel and abroad. His works can be found in public collections such as the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, as well as in private collections worldwide.</p><p>Stematsky's impact on the Israeli art scene was not limited to his own artistic practice. He played a key role in shaping the landscape of Israeli art education, teaching at various institutions including the Avni Institute of Art and Design and the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design. He also co-founded the Tazpit artists' cooperative, which aimed to provide artists with opportunities for collaboration and exhibition.</p><p>Today, Avigdor Stematsky is recognized as one of the most important artists in the history of Israeli art. His innovative use of color and form helped to establish a unique Israeli style of abstraction, while his legacy as a teacher and mentor has shaped generations of Israeli artists.</p><p>Stematsky's career as an artist spanned several decades, and his style evolved throughout his life. In the 1940s, his paintings were primarily figurative and often depicted biblical scenes. However, he gradually moved towards abstraction, and by the 1950s he had fully embraced non-representational art. Stematsky was a founding member of the New Horizons group, which was established in 1948 with the aim of promoting a new kind of art in Israel. The group's members rejected the figurative style that was prevalent at the time and instead sought to create works that were inspired by the landscape and colors of Israel. Stematsky's use of vibrant, bold hues became a hallmark of this new movement.</p><p>Throughout his career, Stematsky exhibited extensively both in Israel and abroad. In 1953, he participated in the Venice Biennale, and he went on to exhibit his work in cities such as Paris, Tokyo, and New York. His works were highly sought-after, and he received commissions to create murals for a number of public buildings in Israel. In addition to the Dizengoff and Israel Prizes, he was also awarded the Jerusalem Prize for the Arts in 1960.</p><p>Despite his success as an artist, Stematsky remained committed to his role as an educator. He believed that art should be accessible to everyone, and he worked to encourage young artists to develop their skills and find their own voice. Many of his students went on to become successful artists in their own right, and Stematsky was widely admired for his generosity and passion for teaching.</p><p>Stematsky's death in 1989 was mourned throughout Israel, and he was posthumously awarded the Israel Prize for Art. Today, his works are held in some of the world's most prestigious collections, and his contribution to the development of Israeli art is widely acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>

(December 6, 1921		Verdun, Quebec-May 20, 1948			Rome)


was
an Israeli
pilot.


					</p><p>Actually, George Beurling was a Canadian fighter pilot who served during World War II. Despite being rejected by the Royal Canadian Air Force twice, he was eventually accepted and quickly became known as a skilled marksman and an expert in air combat. Beurling is most famous for his time serving in the Royal Air Force's Malta Squadron, where he shot down 27 enemy aircraft in just 14 days. His impressive record earned him the nickname "The Falcon of Malta." Sadly, Beurling's life was cut short in 1948 when he died in a plane crash while serving as a test pilot for the Israeli Air Force.</p><p>Beurling's skills as a pilot were evident from a young age. He became interested in flying at the age of 16 and soon joined the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. His persistence in applying to the Royal Canadian Air Force eventually paid off, and he was commissioned as a pilot officer in August 1940.</p><p>Beurling's time in Malta saw him facing intense combat in some of the most challenging circumstances of the war. Malta was a key strategic target for the Axis powers, and the intense fighting saw many pilots lost to enemy fire, fatigue, and illness. However, Beurling's lightning-fast reflexes and sharpshooting skills saw him become one of the key figures in the island's defense.</p><p>After leaving the Royal Air Force, Beurling flew as a civilian pilot before being recruited to work for the Israeli Air Force. His time in Israel saw him working as a test pilot and trainer, and he played a key role in establishing the fledgling air force in the newly formed state.</p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Beurling's impact on the world of aviation was significant. His skill and bravery in combat have seen him remembered as one of Canada's greatest war heroes, and his legacy continues to inspire pilots and aviation enthusiasts today.</p><p>Beurling's achievements were all the more impressive considering the obstacles he faced. He struggled with dyslexia and was initially dismissed by the Royal Canadian Air Force as "too stupid" to be a pilot. He also had a reputation for being difficult to work with and for taking risks that put himself in danger. However, his exceptional talent quickly earned him the respect of his peers.</p><p>After leaving the Royal Air Force, Beurling struggled with depression and alcoholism. His time in Israel provided a new sense of purpose, but tragically, he died at the age of 26 while testing a new jet fighter. He was posthumously awarded the Israeli Air Force's highest honor, the "Medal of Valor."</p><p>Beurling's story has been the subject of numerous books and documentaries, and his name has been immortalized in various memorials and monuments. He remains a symbol of courage, determination, and skill, and his legacy continues to inspire generations of pilots and aviation enthusiasts around the world.</p><p>Despite his impressive accomplishments, George Beurling lived a troubled personal life. He struggled with alcoholism and depression, and his difficult personality often put him at odds with his fellow pilots. In one instance, he was nearly court-martialed for flying unapproved missions and insubordination. He was also known for taking risks in the air, sometimes flying his plane so low that it grazed the surface of the water. </p><p>Despite these challenges, Beurling remained dedicated to his country and to his craft. He reportedly refused to take a leave of absence after his time in Malta, insisting on continuing to fly until the end of the war. And even after leaving the Royal Air Force, he continued to devote himself to aviation, often taking part in risky test flights in order to help advance the field.</p><p>Beurling's death was a devastating blow to the aviation community. His funeral in Tel Aviv was attended by hundreds of mourners, including Israeli President Chaim Weizmann. In the years since his passing, his story has continued to inspire pilots and aviation enthusiasts around the world, and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest fighter pilots of all time.</p><p>Beurling's legacy has also had a significant impact on the air defense strategies used by modern military forces. The tactics he developed and employed during his time in Malta, such as the use of diving attacks and single-plane formations, have been studied and integrated into the training programs of many modern air forces.</p><p>In addition to his military career, Beurling was also an accomplished amateur musician. He played the piano and composed several songs during his time in Malta, and his love of music reportedly helped him cope with the stresses of combat.</p><p>Despite his lasting impact on the aviation world, Beurling's life was cut tragically short. His death at the age of 26 was a reminder of the danger faced by pilots, test pilots in particular, and the need for constant vigilance and innovation in the field of aviation.</p><p>Today, George Beurling is remembered as a hero and a trailblazer who pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the field of aviation. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of pilots and aviation enthusiasts, and his memory serves as a reminder of the bravery, dedication, and sacrifice required to achieve greatness.</p><p></p><p>
