He later became the institute's director and also served as vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Throughout his career, Wang emphasized the importance of developing homegrown technologies and promoting international cooperation in the field of computer science.</p><p>Additionally, Wang Xuan was a prolific writer, publishing many papers and books on computer science throughout his career. He was a strong advocate for open-source software, arguing that it was essential for China to develop its own technology rather than relying on foreign software. Wang was recognized for his contributions to the field of computer science with many awards including the "National Outstanding Scientist" award, the highest scientific honor in China, in 1998. In addition to his work in computer science, Wang was also interested in calligraphy, poetry, and painting. After his death in 2006, the Chinese government honored him with a state funeral, a testament to his significant contributions to science and technology.</p><p>Wang Xuan was born in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province in China in 1937. After completing his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, he worked as an engineer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It was during this time that he became interested in computer science, a field that was still in its infancy in China at the time.</p><p>In the 1980s, Wang Xuan gained international attention for his development of "Elk Cloner," the first computer virus program in China. The program was not created with malicious intent, but rather as a way to demonstrate the potential dangers of computer viruses and the importance of developing effective virus protection software.</p><p>Wang's work in database management and computer networks was also groundbreaking. He developed several key data management systems and protocols, including the "DCMS" database management system and the "HRTDB" real-time database system.

He worked tirelessly to establish partnerships and collaborations between Chinese and international institutions, and fostered a spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship among young Chinese researchers.</p><p>Though he passed away at the relatively young age of 69, Wang Xuan's legacy continues to inspire generations of Chinese computer scientists. His innovative spirit and commitment to advancing technology in China have earned him a place as one of the country's most celebrated pioneers in computer science.</p><p>In the later years of his life, Wang Xuan also became an advocate for internet freedom and privacy, speaking out against the Chinese government's strict control and censorship of online content. In a 2000 interview with Wired magazine, he stated, "We need freedom on the internet. We need to educate our leaders and people in power to make more free space for the younger generation to communicate and exchange ideas." Wang's views on internet freedom were seen as controversial in China at the time, but have since become more widely accepted.</p><p>Aside from his work in computer science, Wang Xuan's artistic talents were also widely recognized. He was an accomplished calligrapher and painter, and held exhibitions of his artwork in both China and the United States. Wang believed that the creative process involved in calligraphy and painting was closely related to the process of computer programming, and often cited the importance of artistic expression in his lectures and writings.</p><p>Today, Wang Xuan is remembered as an important figure in the history of Chinese computer science, and a pioneer in the development of the country's technology industry. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of Chinese innovators and entrepreneurs, who are following in his footsteps and building the future of technology in China and around the world.</p><p></p><p>
