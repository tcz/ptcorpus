(May 21, 1960		West Allis-November 28, 1994			Portage)

	
		also known as Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer

	
was
an American
criminal.


					</p><p>Dahmer became notorious for committing the rape, murder, and dismemberment of 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. He often cannibalized parts of his victims and kept body parts as souvenirs. He was finally caught in 1991 after one of his intended victims managed to escape and alert the police. Dahmer pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to 15 life terms in prison. While in prison, he was beaten to death by a fellow inmate in 1994. Dahmer's case remains one of the most infamous in American criminal history.</p><p>Dahmer had a troubled childhood, and struggled with alcoholism and feelings of isolation throughout his life. He dropped out of Ohio State University after just one semester due to poor grades, and soon after, he began committing his first murders. After his arrest, Dahmer underwent a series of psychiatric evaluations and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and necrophilia. He attempted to seek help and even expressed remorse for his actions, but ultimately, his sentence was carried out. His case sparked a national conversation about mental illness and the criminal justice system. Today, Dahmer's crimes continue to fascinate and horrify people around the world.</p><p>Attempts were made to understand the mind of such a heinous killer. Authorities confirmed that Dahmer was also greatly affected by his parent's divorce when he was just 18 years old. Before the killings began, Dahmer would often pick up random hitchhikers for fleeting sexual encounters, which later escalated to murder. Following his capture, a search of his apartment revealed several horrific objects, including human remains that he had kept, decomposing body parts, a human head in the refrigerator, and several photographs of his victims. Dahmer's victims were mostly below the age of 30 and included a mix of racial backgrounds. Today, a monument exists at the site where Dahmer was killed in prison, although it remains a controversial site of interest for many people.</p><p>Dahmer's crimes had a lasting impact on both his victims' families and American society at large. He was known as the "Milwaukee Cannibal" and his case remains a subject of fascination and discussion in the media, including books, documentaries, and even movies. Dahmer's story has been the subject of numerous urban legends and myths, many of which are not true. The city of Milwaukee, where the majority of his crimes took place, has since worked to distance itself from the infamous serial killer.</p><p>In the years following Dahmer's death, many questions have been raised about his motivations and the social and cultural factors that may have contributed to his actions. His crimes have been studied extensively by criminal psychologists, and some have suggested that his alcoholism and deep-seated feelings of loneliness and isolation played a significant role in his crimes. Others have pointed to his troubled childhood and the trauma of his parents' divorce as possible factors.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, Dahmer's crimes remain a stark reminder of the horrors that human beings are capable of committing. His story has been a cautionary tale, warning against the dangers of unchecked mental illness and the need to take seriously the warning signs of dangerous behavior in others. Today, the memory of Dahmer's victims lives on, as loved ones continue to mourn their loss and the world at large struggles to come to terms with the tragedy that he inflicted.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by murder.

(December 17, 1937		New Orleans-March 26, 1969			Biloxi)


was
an American
author, writer, novelist, professor, journalist and soldier.


					</p><p>Toole is best known for his posthumously published novel, "A Confederacy of Dunces," which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1981. The novel was championed by author Walker Percy and Toole's mother, Thelma, who worked tirelessly to get the book published after her son's death. Toole struggled with mental illness throughout his life and his experiences in the military, academia, and the publishing industry all contributed to his struggles. However, his legacy endures and his work continues to be celebrated and studied by scholars and readers alike.</p><p>Toole's upbringing in New Orleans heavily influenced his writing, and the city's unique culture and language are prominent themes in "A Confederacy of Dunces." After receiving a Master's degree in English from Columbia University, Toole spent time in Puerto Rico teaching English and writing for various newspapers. He later taught at a number of colleges and universities, including Hunter College, the University of Southwestern Louisiana, and Tulane University. Throughout his life, Toole suffered from depression and was ultimately hospitalized for treatment. Despite his tragic end, his contributions to American literature are widely acknowledged and continue to be celebrated. In addition to "A Confederacy of Dunces", Toole's shorter works have also been published posthumously.</p><p>Toole's tragic death at the age of 31 cut short a promising career in writing and academia. However, his impact on American literature cannot be overstated. "A Confederacy of Dunces" is considered a classic of Southern literature and is often cited as one of the funniest novels ever written. Its complex protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, has become a beloved and enduring character in American fiction. In addition to his writing and teaching, Toole also served in the United States Army, where he trained as a linguist and worked as a propaganda writer for Radio Free Europe. Despite his struggles with mental illness, Toole was remembered by those who knew him as a brilliant and charismatic individual. His tragic death has led many to reflect on the struggles faced by artists and intellectuals, and the importance of supporting those struggling with mental illness.</p><p>Toole's writing career started at an early age, and he was known for his wit and humor even as a child. He was a voracious reader and had a passion for literature, which he would later pursue in his academic and professional life. After completing his Master's degree, Toole briefly worked as an English professor at Hunter College in New York City. He resigned from the position after only a few months and returned to New Orleans, where he struggled to find his place in the academic community. Toole's attempts to publish his work were also met with rejection, and he eventually fell into a deep depression. He was hospitalized several times and underwent electroshock therapy in an attempt to treat his mental illness.</p><p>Toole's mother, Thelma, was a significant influence on his literary career. She continued to champion his work after his death, advocating for its publication and pursuing legal action against those who she believed had plagiarized her son's writing. It was largely due to her efforts that "A Confederacy of Dunces" was finally published, and the novel was an instant success. The book's popularity led to Toole being posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1981, an honor that recognized the tremendous talent that had been lost too soon. </p><p>Toole's work continues to be studied and celebrated, and "A Confederacy of Dunces" remains a classic of Southern literature. The humor, satire, and unique characters in the novel have influenced countless writers, and Toole's legacy as a brilliant and complex literary figure endures.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as Mayor Joseph Smith, Jr. or Joseph Smith, Jr.

	
was
an American
tradesman and politician.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Joseph Smith III and Julia Murdock Smith.

						</p><p>Joseph Smith was the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, commonly known as the Mormon Church. He was born in Sharon, Vermont and spent much of his childhood moving around with his family. In 1820, he had a vision of God the Father and Jesus Christ, which led him to start seeking answers about religion. </p><p>In 1823, Smith said he was visited by angel Moroni and informed of an ancient record, which he translated and published as the Book of Mormon in 1830. He quickly gained a large following and established the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. </p><p>Smith faced much persecution and opposition from non-Mormon neighbors, leading to the church's expulsion from several states before finally settling in Nauvoo, Illinois. Smith was also involved in politics, serving as mayor of Nauvoo and running for President of the United States. </p><p>In 1844, he was arrested and jailed for destroying a printing press that was critical of him and the church. While in jail, he was killed by a mob, which led to increased violence against the church and its members. Despite this, the LDS church continued to grow and is now a global organization with millions of members.</p><p>Joseph Smith's teachings and leadership have had a significant impact on American religion and culture. Many of his beliefs, including the importance of family and the concept of eternal marriage, continue to be central to the LDS church today. Smith's life and legacy have also been the subject of much controversy and debate. Some critics have alleged that he was a fraud and that the Book of Mormon was not a legitimate record, while others see him as a visionary leader who inspired a religious movement. Regardless of one's views on Smith, his impact on American religious history remains significant to this day.</p><p>After Joseph Smith's death, leadership of the LDS church passed to Brigham Young, who led the group westward to what is now Salt Lake City, Utah. The church established a theocratic government in Utah, which became a territory of the United States in 1850, leading to conflicts with the federal government. This eventually resulted in the abandonment of the church's practice of polygamy in 1890, which allowed Utah to become a state in 1896.</p><p>Today, the LDS church has over 16 million members worldwide and is known for its emphasis on missionary work, family values, and strict adherence to a set of religious and moral guidelines known as the Word of Wisdom. The church has also been involved in various humanitarian and social programs, including disaster relief efforts, education initiatives, and aid to refugees.</p><p>Despite ongoing controversies surrounding the LDS church, Joseph Smith remains a revered figure among believers, who view him as a prophet and the restorer of ancient Christianity. His life and teachings continue to influence the beliefs and practices of millions of people around the world.</p><p>Smith's death at the hands of a mob has been a source of controversy and speculation for many years. While some believe that he was killed as a result of his religious beliefs, others argue that his actions as a political and military leader in Nauvoo had made him many enemies, leading to his assassination. In any case, his death was a significant loss for the LDS church, which was forced to navigate a period of turmoil and uncertainty in the years following his passing.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the LDS church continued to grow and evolve, under the leadership of Brigham Young and subsequent presidents. The church's emphasis on family values, missionary work, and community service has helped it to become one of the most influential religious organizations in the world today. While Smith's role in the church's history may be debated, his impact on the faith and its followers remains undeniable.</p><p></p><p>

an American
novelist and writer.


					</p><p>Kornbluth was best known for his science fiction writing, which included the classic short story "The Marching Morons" and the novel "The Space Merchants," which he co-wrote with Frederik Pohl. He also worked as an editor and wrote non-fiction articles on a variety of topics, including politics and economics. Kornbluth was a member of the Futurians, a group of science fiction fans and writers who were influential in the development of the genre. He died at the young age of 34 from a heart attack. Despite his short career, Kornbluth left behind a lasting legacy as one of the most important voices in 20th century science fiction.</p><p>Kornbluth's writing often explored social and political themes, using science fiction as a framework to critique various aspects of modern society. In addition to "The Space Merchants," Kornbluth also co-wrote several other novels with Frederik Pohl, including "Gladiator-At-Law" and "Wolfbane." He also wrote a number of solo works, such as "Not This August" and "The Syndic." Kornbluth's work had a significant impact on the genre of science fiction, and he influenced many other writers who followed in his footsteps. In 1990, he was awarded a posthumous induction into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.</p><p>Kornbluth was born to Jewish immigrant parents who had fled persecution in Russia. He was a precocious child who skipped several grades in school and began writing at an early age. After high school, Kornbluth served in the Army during World War II, which had a profound influence on his writing. His experiences in the military informed his views on war and society, and many of his stories dealt with the aftermath of conflict and the psychology of soldiers.</p><p>After the war, Kornbluth attended the University of Chicago, where he became friends with fellow science fiction writers and enthusiasts, including Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein. As a member of the Futurians, Kornbluth participated in science fiction conventions and helped launch the careers of several prominent writers.</p><p>Throughout his career, Kornbluth struggled with alcoholism and financial difficulties. Despite these challenges, he continued to write prolifically and was highly regarded by his peers.

His legacy continues to inspire new generations of writers and readers alike.</p><p>Kornbluth's work also had a significant impact on the world of film and TV. Several of his stories, such as "The Marching Morons" and "The Little Black Bag," were adapted into popular episodes of "The Twilight Zone" and other sci-fi TV shows. In addition, his novel "The Space Merchants" was optioned for a film adaptation in the early 1960s, but the project was ultimately never completed.</p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Kornbluth's influence on science fiction is still felt today. His writing explored complex themes like political corruption, consumerism, and militarism, paving the way for future writers to interrogate these same issues in their own work. His legacy also continues through his collaborations with Frederik Pohl, which produced some of the most enduring works of science fiction in the 20th century. Overall, Kornbluth's life and work serve as a reminder of the power of science fiction to challenge and inspire us, both as individuals and as a society.</p><p></p><p>

		also known as The Iron Horse, Henry Louis Gehrig, Lou, Buster, Ludwig Heinrich Gehrig, Larrupin&#039; Lou, Biscuit Pants, Henry Louis &quot;Lou&quot; Gehrig or Henry Louis &quot;Buster&quot; Gehrig

	
was
an American
baseball player and actor.


					</p><p>Gehrig was a first baseman who played for the New York Yankees for 17 seasons from 1923 to 1939. He was one of the greatest baseball players in history, known for his powerful swing and his incredible durability, playing in a then-record 2,130 consecutive games. Gehrig was a seven-time All-Star, won six World Series championships with the Yankees, and was the American League MVP twice. He had a career batting average of .340 and hit 493 home runs. Gehrig retired from baseball in 1939 when he was diagnosed with ALS, a disease which is now commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Despite his health struggles, he remained positive and delivered his famous "luckiest man" speech at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939. After his death in 1941, Gehrig was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. In addition to his baseball career, Gehrig also appeared in several films including "Rawhide" and "The Pride of the Yankees," a biographical film about his life.</p><p>Off the field, Gehrig was known for his quiet and humble personality, earning him the nickname "The Iron Horse" for his reliable and consistent performance. He was well-respected by teammates, fans, and opponents alike. In 1933, he married Eleanor Twitchell, whom he had met at a dance in Chicago. The couple had no children. Gehrig's diagnosis of ALS was a shock to the baseball community and the public. After his retirement, he dedicated his time to raising awareness and funding for research into the disease. The Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, which recognizes players who exhibit character and integrity both on and off the field, was established in his honor in 1955. Gehrig's legacy continues to inspire and impact the world of baseball and beyond.</p><p>Gehrig was born in Yorkville, Manhattan to German immigrant parents. Growing up, he excelled in baseball, football, and basketball. He attended Columbia University but left after just two years to pursue a career in baseball. Gehrig was signed by the New York Yankees in 1923 and made his major league debut later that same year. His impressive performance on the field quickly earned him the nickname "The Iron Horse." </p><p>Gehrig's consecutive game streak began in 1925 and lasted for 14 years until he had to sit out due to his illness. His durability and reliability on the field were a testament to his work ethic and commitment to the sport. Despite his illness, Gehrig remained active in baseball, serving as a coach for the Yankees and appearing at various events.</p><p>In addition to his philanthropic efforts for ALS research, Gehrig was known for his charitable work with children. He set up the Lou Gehrig Youth Fund and would often spend time with sick children in hospitals, bringing them toys and raising their spirits. </p><p>In 1942, a year after Gehrig's death, the New York Yankees retired his number, making him the first player in Major League Baseball history to receive such an honor. Gehrig's legacy continues to live on in the hearts of baseball fans, and his incredible career and life continue to inspire many to this day.</p><p>Gehrig's impressive baseball career was marked by numerous achievements and accolades. He was a two-time AL batting champion, a four-time RBI champion, and a member of the 1934 AL All-Star team. In 1931, he hit four home runs in a single game, a feat only 16 players have accomplished in baseball history. In 1939, the same year of his retirement, Gehrig was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards in the United States.</p><p>Despite his unparalleled success on the field, Gehrig remained humble and dedicated to his craft. He once famously quipped, "I'm not a headline guy. I know that as long as I was following Ruth to the plate I could have stood on my head and no one would have known the difference."</p><p>Gehrig's battle with ALS, a disease that takes control of the body's motor functions, made him a symbol of strength and perseverance in the face of adversity. His "luckiest man" speech, delivered on July 4, 1939, stands as one of the most heart-wrenching moments in sports history. In it, Gehrig stated, "Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth." Despite facing a terminal illness, Gehrig remained positive and grateful for the many blessings he had received in his life.</p><p>Lou Gehrig's legacy has extended far beyond the world of baseball. His tireless work to raise awareness and funds for ALS research inspired the establishment of many organizations focused on finding a cure for the debilitating disease. His life and career continue to be an inspiration for countless individuals who strive to embody his spirit of determination, hard work, and humility.</p><p></p><p>

King Day, a national holiday in the United States, celebrates his achievements and legacy every year.</p><p>Beyond his activism and leadership in the civil rights movement, King was also known for his dedication to the idea of nonviolence. He believed that nonviolent resistance was the most effective way to bring about social change and inspire others to do the same. His belief in nonviolence was deeply rooted in his Christian faith, which he saw as inseparable from his activism.

(January 22, 1906		Peaster-June 11, 1936			Cross Plains)

	
		a.k.a. Robert Ervin Howard, Patrick Ervin or Robert Howard

	
was
an American
writer, novelist and author.


					</p><p>Howard is best known as the creator of the character Conan the Barbarian, which he wrote about in a series of fantasy stories and books. He also wrote in other genres, including westerns and horror. Howard's writing career began in his late teens and he was published in pulp magazines throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Despite his success as a writer, Howard struggled with personal troubles throughout his life and ultimately took his own life at the age of 30. Over the years, Howard's work has been adapted into numerous films, television shows, comic books, and video games, making him one of the most influential authors in the fantasy and science fiction genres.</p><p>Howard's childhood was marked by poverty and his family often moved around Texas, where his father worked as a doctor. He developed a love for reading and writing at a young age, which he credited to his mother, who was a teacher. Howard was an avid fan of adventure and pulp fiction, and his early stories were heavily influenced by these genres.</p><p>The character of Conan the Barbarian was first introduced in the story "The Phoenix on the Sword" in 1932, which was published in the pulp magazine Weird Tales. Conan quickly became a fan favorite and Howard went on to write numerous stories featuring the character. Along with Conan, Howard created other popular characters such as Solomon Kane and Bran Mak Morn.</p><p>Howard's work was also known for its heightened sense of adventure, vivid descriptions of action and violence, and its complex themes of morality, masculinity, and power. His writing style influenced many writers who followed in his footsteps, including J.R.R Tolkien and George R.R. Martin.</p><p>In addition to his writing, Howard was a skilled amateur boxer and enjoyed spending time outdoors, hunting and fishing. Despite his success as a writer, Howard struggled with severe depression and personal issues throughout his life. His death by suicide came as a shock to many of his contemporaries and fans.</p><p>Today, Howard's legacy lives on through his influential body of work, which has inspired countless writers, artists, and creators in the fantasy and science fiction genres.</p><p>Howard's literary career began when he was just a teenager, as he sold his first story to Weird Tales magazine at the age of 18. He continued to write for pulp magazines throughout his early twenties and eventually transitioned into writing novels. Despite his success, Howard was known to be a solitary and troubled individual, who struggled with alcoholism and bouts of depression. He often expressed feelings of disillusionment with the world around him and a fascination with death and the afterlife.</p><p>In addition to his fiction writing, Howard also wrote poetry, some of which was published in small literary magazines of the time. He was also an amateur historian, with a particular interest in the American Old West and European medieval history. Howard incorporated many of these historical influences into his fiction, creating complex and immersive worlds that continue to captivate readers today.</p><p>Since his death, Howard's work has been reprinted in numerous editions and adaptations, including comic books, graphic novels, and audio dramas. He has been recognized posthumously with numerous awards and honors for his contributions to the fantasy and science fiction genres, and his enduring legacy continues to inspire new generations of writers and creators.</p><p>Howard's work was not only influential within the fantasy and science fiction genres, but it also had a significant impact on popular culture as a whole. His creation, Conan the Barbarian, has been adapted into multiple movies, TV shows, video games, and other forms of media over the years. In fact, the character became so popular that it inspired an entire sub-genre of fantasy fiction known as "Sword and Sorcery."Howard's writings and characters also had an impact on the broader cultural and political landscape of his time. For example, his stories were set during a time of great social upheaval in the United States, and many of the themes he explored - such as violence, masculinity, and power - were relevant to the broader cultural struggles of the era. Howard's work also reflected his own views on politics and society, which were often controversial and even offensive to some. Nonetheless, his contributions continue to be celebrated by fans and literary scholars alike, as his writing remains an enduring testament to the power of imagination and the human spirit.</p><p></p><p>

(March 4, 1826		Bridgeport-November 2, 1863)

	
		also known as Theodore Dehone Judah

	
was
an American
entrepreneur and engineer.


					</p><p>He is best known for his role in the construction of the first transcontinental railroad in the United States. Judah was a driving force behind the idea of a railroad that would connect the East Coast to the West Coast, and he spent years lobbying government officials and searching for investors to make his vision a reality. He ultimately helped to form the Central Pacific Railroad Company, which was instrumental in building a portion of the railroad that ran through the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. Despite facing many challenges, including difficult terrain and financial setbacks, Judah's perseverance and engineering expertise were key to the success of the project. Today, he is remembered as an important figure in American transportation history.</p><p>Before his successful involvement in the Central Pacific Railroad project, Judah had several engineering and surveying jobs, including surveying for potential routes for a transcontinental railroad. He also spent time in California during its Gold Rush, where he gained valuable knowledge of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and their potential for a railroad route. Judah was known for his technical expertise in the field of railroad engineering, which he further honed during his work on the Sacramento Valley Railroad. Additionally, he was instrumental in convincing Abraham Lincoln to sign the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862, which provided funding for the construction of the transcontinental railroad. Despite his contributions, Judah faced discrimination and opposition due to his Jewish heritage. In his honor, California designated April 4th as "Theodore Judah Day," and he was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006.</p><p>After Judah's death, his widow Anna, donated his collection of maps, surveys and reports to the Smithsonian Institution. This collection served as a fundamental source of information for those working on the construction of the transcontinental railroad. Judah's legacy also continued through his colleagues who went on to complete the transcontinental railroad, as well as through the many towns and cities that developed along the railroad route. In addition to his railway engineering contributions, Judah was also involved in the development of hydroelectric power and was a founding member of the American Society of Civil Engineers. He was a visionary leader who played a significant role in the expansion of transportation infrastructure and the development of the American West.</p><p>Judah's pioneering work on the transcontinental railroad helped reshape American transportation and commerce, making it possible for people and goods to travel across the country more quickly and efficiently than ever before. His engineering expertise helped overcome many of the technical challenges of constructing a railroad through the challenging terrain of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Without Judah's leadership and technical skills, it is unlikely that the transcontinental railroad would have been completed as quickly or successfully. Despite facing discrimination during his lifetime, Judah's legacy continues to inspire those working in transportation and engineering fields today. His contributions to American infrastructure and society are still felt today, more than 150 years after his death.</p><p></p><p>
						He died as a result of yellow fever.

personality.


					</p><p>Stonewall Jackson was a renowned Confederate general during the American Civil War. He earned his famous nickname during the First Battle of Bull Run when he and his troops held a defensive position and refused to yield to Union forces. He was known for his military strategy and quick decision making on the battlefield. Outside of his military career, Jackson was a devout Christian and taught at Virginia Military Institute before the outbreak of the Civil War. His death was a significant loss to the Confederacy and is still mourned by many today.</p><p>Stonewall Jackson was born into a poor family and had to work hard to earn an education. After his father passed away when Jackson was very young, he was raised by his uncle. Despite this setback, Jackson was determined to succeed and went on to attend West Point Military Academy, where he graduated in 1846. He went on to serve in the Mexican-American War and later became a professor at the Virginia Military Institute.</p><p>During the Civil War, Jackson quickly rose through the ranks of the Confederate army, earning the respect and admiration of his troops through his bravery and leadership on the battlefield. He was known for his unorthodox tactics, such as his use of surprise attacks and flanking maneuvers, which helped him achieve many victories against larger Union forces.</p><p>Despite his success on the battlefield, Jackson was also known for his strict religious beliefs and ascetic lifestyle. He was a devout Presbyterian and believed that God was on the side of the Confederacy. He also believed in the importance of discipline and order, both in his personal life and on the battlefield.</p><p>Jackson's death was a significant loss to the Confederate army, as he was considered one of its most talented and innovative commanders. His legacy lives on, however, and he remains an important figure in American history.</p><p>Stonewall Jackson was married twice in his life. His first marriage was to Elinor Junkin, who unfortunately died during childbirth along with their unborn child. Later, Jackson married Mary Anna Morrison, whom he had met during his time at the Virginia Military Institute. The couple had a daughter named Julia Laura Jackson.

He even taught astronomy at the Virginia Military Institute and built an observatory on campus.</p><p>Today, Stonewall Jackson is remembered both as a military leader and a symbol of the Confederacy. His statues and memorials remain a source of controversy, as many people view him as a symbol of racism and oppression.

Regardless of one’s opinions on his legacy, Jackson’s impact on American history is undeniable.</p><p>During the Battle of Chancellorsville, Jackson was mistakenly shot by Confederate troops and died a few days later due to complications from pneumonia. His death was a great loss for the Confederacy and General Robert E. Lee is said to have mourned him deeply.
