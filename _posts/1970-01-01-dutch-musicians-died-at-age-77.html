(January 30, 1563		Bruges-January 11, 1641			Groningen)


was
a Dutch
scientist.


					</p><p>He is best known for his involvement in the Arminian controversy, a theological dispute that split the Dutch Reformed Church in the early 17th century. Gomarus was a strict Calvinist and opposed the teachings of Jacobus Arminius, who argued for a more inclusive approach to salvation. Gomarus' teachings became known as Gomarism and were instrumental in the Synod of Dort in 1618-19, where the Arminians were condemned and Gomarus' views were established as the orthodox position of the Dutch Reformed Church. Aside from his theological legacy, Gomarus was also a prominent scholar and professor of theology at the University of Leiden and the University of Groningen, where he held the position of rector magnificus for 11 years. He made significant contributions to the fields of Hebrew and Syriac studies, and his works on these subjects are still studied by scholars today.</p><p>Gomarus was born in Bruges, Flanders, which was then a part of the Spanish Netherlands. He was originally named François Gomaere but later changed his name to the Latin form Franciscus Gomarus. He studied at the universities of Bruges, Douai, Leiden, and Heidelberg, where he developed a deep interest in Calvinism. In 1588, he was appointed as professor of theology at the University of Saumur in France. </p><p>After returning to the Netherlands in 1594, Gomarus became involved in the Arminian controversy, which would consume much of his life's work. He was appointed as professor of theology at the University of Leiden, where he came into conflict with his colleague, Jacobus Arminius, over the interpretation of predestination and election in Calvinist theology. Gomarus argued for a strict interpretation, whereas Arminius held a more inclusive view of salvation.</p><p>The controversy escalated after Arminius' death in 1609, with Gomarus leading the Gomarists, a group of Calvinist ministers who opposed the Arminian teachings. The situation came to a head at the Synod of Dort, where Gomarus played a key role in drafting the Canons of Dort, which condemned the Arminian teachings and established Gomarism as the orthodox position of the Dutch Reformed Church.</p><p>In addition to his theological work, Gomarus was also a gifted scholar and linguist. He made significant contributions to the field of Hebrew studies, including his work on the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible. His studies of the Syriac Peshitta were also highly regarded, and he published several works on the subject.</p><p>Despite the controversies that surrounded him, Gomarus was widely respected for his intelligence and integrity, and he remained one of the most prominent theologians of his time. He died in Groningen in 1641, having spent much of his life defending the orthodox position of the Dutch Reformed Church.</p><p>Gomarus was also known for his influence on the educational system in the Netherlands. He believed that education should be rooted in Calvinist principles and that children should be taught to read and understand the Bible from an early age. He worked to establish Calvinist schools throughout the country, and his teachings on education had a profound impact on Dutch society.</p><p>Gomarus' legacy in the Netherlands is still felt today. The Reformed churches in the country continue to adhere to his teachings, and the Gomarus Scholengemeenschap, a network of Christian schools, is named after him. His contributions to theology and linguistics also continue to be studied by scholars around the world.</p><p>Gomarus had a significant impact on the political landscape of his time, as well. He was a staunch supporter of the House of Orange and played a role in the Dutch struggle for independence from Spain. He was also a vocal opponent of the Remonstrants, a group of Arminian sympathizers who opposed the policies of the House of Orange and sought to limit the power of the Dutch government.</p><p>In addition to his theological and academic work, Gomarus was also a prolific author. He wrote several influential works on Calvinist theology, including "Commentarii in Epistolam ad Romanos" and "De Satisfactione Christi." He also wrote extensively on the topics of Hebrew and Syriac studies, producing several highly-regarded works on these subjects.</p><p>Despite his reputation as a firebrand in the Arminian controversy, Gomarus was known for his humility and compassion. He was deeply committed to his students and was known for his kindness and generosity. He frequently helped students who were struggling financially, and he even took in several orphaned children and raised them as his own.</p><p>Today, Gomarus' legacy continues to be felt in the Netherlands and around the world. His contributions to theology, linguistics, and education continue to be studied and admired, and his influence on Dutch society and politics still resonates.</p><p>Gomarus' life was one of religious fervor and deep conviction. He saw himself as a defender of the true faith and spent much of his life working to ensure that the Dutch Reformed Church remained true to its Calvinist roots. Despite his unwavering conviction, however, he was also known for his willingness to listen to and engage with those who held contrasting views. He believed that intellectual rigor and honest debate were essential to the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.Gomarus' influence on the Dutch Reformed Church was profound, shaping its doctrine and practices for centuries to come. His legacy helped to define the religious character of the Netherlands, which has remained predominantly Calvinist to this day. In addition to his work in theology, linguistics, and education, Gomarus was also deeply involved in the political and social issues of his time. He saw his work as part of a broader effort to establish a just and righteous society, one that was grounded in the principles of Calvinism.For these reasons, Gomarus is remembered today not just as a theologian, but as a key figure in the history of the Netherlands, one who helped to shape the country's cultural, social, and political identity. His tireless work defending the orthodox position of the Dutch Reformed Church and promoting the Calvinist intellectual tradition continues to inspire scholars and thinkers to this day.</p><p></p><p>

(November 3, 1894-October 2, 1972)


was
a Dutch
astronomer.


					</p><p>He is known for his research on stars and galaxies, specifically for his work on the distribution and motion of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Zanstra earned his PhD in astronomy from Leiden University in the Netherlands and went on to work at several astronomical observatories in Europe, including the Leiden Observatory and the Mount Wilson Observatory in California, USA. He also served as the director of the Bosscha Observatory in Indonesia. Zanstra was recognized for his contributions to astronomy with several awards and honors, including the Bruce Medal from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.</p><p>During his career, Zanstra collaborated with other famous astronomers, such as Jan Oort and Ejnar Hertzsprung, contributing to the development of our understanding of the star's properties, particularly in regards to their distance, age, and size. He was also one of the first astronomers to suggest that dust grains absorb visible light and re-radiate it in the infrared, which is why we now refer to the Zanstra process. In addition to his research work, Zanstra was involved in the establishment of an astronomical observatory in Iran, and he worked tirelessly to promote astronomy education and public outreach. At the time of his death, Zanstra was considered to be one of the most prolific and respected astronomers in the Netherlands.</p><p>Zanstra's contributions to astronomy were not limited to research and education. During World War II, he was an active member of the Dutch resistance and risked his life to help Jewish families escape Nazi persecution. In 1953, Zanstra was one of the founding members of the International Astronomical Union's Committee on the History of Astronomy, which aimed to document the history of the field and the people who contributed to it. Zanstra also authored several books, including "Stars and Stellar Systems" and "The Light of the Night Sky". His legacy lives on through the Zanstra method, an astronomical technique used to estimate the temperature of gas surrounding a star. Today, the Zanstra effect is still an important area of research in astronomy and astrophysics.</p><p>During his time at Leiden Observatory, Herman Zanstra discovered the Zanstra nebulae, which are ionized gases surrounding white dwarf stars. He also made significant contributions to the study of planetary nebulae, the remnants of once bright stars, which are now mostly composed of gases and dust. Zanstra identified one of the defining features of planetary nebulae, their emission spectra. In his later years, Zanstra also focused his attention on the radio study of the Milky Way's gas, which led to insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies. He passed away on October 2, 1972, leaving a lasting legacy in the field of astronomy.</p><p>Zanstra's work on radioastronomy provided a foundation for the study of neutral hydrogen gas in galaxies. His observations of radio emission from outer space paved the way for the discovery of the 21-cm line, a spectral line of neutral hydrogen gas that is used to map the structure of galaxies. In the field of astrophysics, the Zanstra effect is still used to estimate the temperature of the gas that surrounds a star, which helps researchers obtain vital information about the star's properties. Zanstra's contributions have been recognized by the scientific community through various tributes and awards, including the naming of the asteroid 3317 Zanstra, in honor of his contributions to astronomy.</p><p></p><p>

He was a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and served as the treasurer of the Association of Dutch Manufacturers for many years. Schoute was also involved in the promotion of scientific education, and he was a founding member of the Society for the Promotion of Secondary Education in the Netherlands.</p><p>In his mathematical work, Schoute collaborated with other prominent mathematicians of his time, including Felix Klein and Georg Cantor. He made significant contributions to the study of hyperelliptic functions and was among the first mathematicians to work on the theory of theta functions. Schoute's work on algebraic geometry, which involved the use of geometric methods to study algebraic equations, was highly influential in the development of modern algebraic geometry. He is also known for his work on the theory of invariants, which are mathematical objects that remain unchanged under certain transformations. Schoute published numerous papers throughout his career and was widely respected for his expertise in a variety of mathematical fields. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important Dutch mathematicians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p><p>Schoute made significant contributions to the theory of algebraic curves, specifically on the inflection theory of curves. His work on the three-dimensional space of inflection lines of a curve led to the discovery of the Schoute configuration, which is a collection of 27 lines and 27 planes arranged in a certain way in three-dimensional space. This configuration is now a standard example in projective geometry. Schoute also contributed to the theory of algebraic surfaces, where he introduced the concept of the P-surface, which is a surface that contains only points of multiplicity two or less. His work on algebraic surfaces also led to the discovery of the Schoute cones, which are cones in three-dimensional space that satisfy certain geometric conditions related to algebraic surfaces. </p><p>Aside from his mathematical contributions, Schoute was also known for his kind and generous personality. He was described by his colleagues as a modest and dedicated researcher, who was always willing to help and share his ideas with others. In recognition of his work, he received numerous awards and honors, including the Royal Society of London's Sylvester Medal in 1912.

As a student at the University of Amsterdam, he was mentored by the prominent mathematician Gerrit Mannoury, who recognized Schoute's potential early on and encouraged him to pursue advanced research. Schoute's early work in algebraic geometry was focused on the theory of theta functions and hyperelliptic functions, which are functions that can be expressed as solutions to algebraic equations. He quickly established himself as a leading figure in the field and began collaborating with other mathematicians to make significant advances.</p><p>In addition to his research, Schoute was also an active member of the academic community. He served as a professor at several universities in the Netherlands, including the University of Groningen and the University of Utrecht. He was also a member of numerous scientific societies and played an important role in the organization of conferences and other scientific events. Schoute was known for his ability to communicate complex mathematical ideas in a clear and accessible way, and his lectures and presentations were highly regarded by his colleagues and students.</p><p>Despite his many achievements, Schoute remained humble and dedicated to his work throughout his life. He continued to conduct research and publish papers well into his seventies, and he remained a mentor and inspiration to generations of mathematicians. Today, he is remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of algebraic geometry, and his contributions to the field continue to inspire new generations of researchers.</p><p>Schoute's contributions to mathematics were not limited to algebraic geometry. He also made significant contributions to the study of determinants, which are mathematical objects used to solve systems of linear equations. Schoute introduced a new method for computing determinants, which became known as Schoute's method. This method was later extended and generalized by other mathematicians, leading to the development of modern techniques for computing determinants.</p><p>In addition to his academic work, Schoute also played an active role in promoting international collaboration in mathematics. He was a member of the International Mathematical Union and played a key role in organizing the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1908, which was held in Rome. Schoute's work helped to establish a network of mathematicians from around the world, paving the way for future collaboration and exchange of ideas.</p><p>Schoute's legacy also extends beyond mathematics. He was a devout Christian and a member of the Dutch Reformed Church. He believed that science and religion were complementary and worked to promote a deeper understanding of the relationship between the two. Schoute wrote several books on the topic, including "Mathematics and Faith" and "Our Knowledge of God."</p><p>Schoute's impact on mathematics and society was profound, and his contributions continue to be recognized and celebrated today. Numerous mathematical concepts and structures bear his name, including the Schoute tensor, the Schoute toric variety, and the Schoute quartic surface. Additionally, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences awards the Schoute Medal to outstanding mathematicians every three years in his honor.</p><p></p><p>

In addition to his work for the Dutch East India Company, he also produced maps of several European cities and regions, including Brussels and the Spanish Netherlands.</p><p>Van Langren's lunar map was particularly notable for its accuracy and attention to detail, and it remained the most detailed map of the moon for several decades. He also made notable contributions to the field of trigonometry, such as his invention of the "Two-Foot Rule" for measuring heights and distances.</p><p>Despite his financial struggles, van Langren remained committed to his work and continued to publish important scientific works throughout his life. His passion for exploration and discovery has inspired countless scientists and explorers in the centuries since his death, and his legacy continues to be celebrated today.</p><p>Van Langren's family legacy of cartography continued for several generations, with his son Johannes and grandson Arnold producing maps and globes as well. In fact, the Van Langren family is considered one of the most important and influential cartographic families in Dutch history. Van Langren's lunar map also inspired other astronomers to create their own detailed maps of the moon, and his method of predicting the position of the moon was used as the basis for future methods of measuring longitude.</p><p>Van Langren's work in improving navigational instruments and his contributions to trigonometry and navigation also had practical implications for maritime trade and exploration. His accurate maps and navigational tools helped sailors and explorers to navigate more safely and make new discoveries in uncharted territories. Therefore, Van Langren's legacy extends beyond the realm of pure science and has had real-world impacts on global exploration and trade.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions, several landmarks have been named after Van Langren, including the Michael Van Langren Planetarium in Brussels, Belgium. His lunar map and other works are also preserved in museums and libraries around the world, and continue to be studied by historians, cartographers, and astronomers alike.

He served as a councilor in Amsterdam and was a member of the States-General of the Netherlands. He was also involved in negotiations with the British government during the First Anglo-Dutch War, where he helped draft a peace treaty. Van Langren's political involvement highlights his influence and reputation during his lifetime, as well as the many talents and skills he possessed beyond his scientific pursuits. Despite not receiving the recognition and financial stability he deserved during his lifetime, Michael van Langren's impact on the fields of cartography, astronomy, and navigation continues to be celebrated and studied today.</p><p></p><p>
