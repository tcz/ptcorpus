He studied at the University of Pest and then worked as a teacher in various towns.</p><p>In 1792, Kármán started his literary career with the publication of his play "The Ignorant Teacher". This was followed by several more plays and collections of poetry such as "The Fall of Neros" and "The Abduction of Eurydice". In addition to his works of literature, Kármán was also an active member of the Hungarian Enlightenment movement.</p><p>Kármán died at the age of 26, cutting short what could have been a promising career in Hungarian literature. Despite this, his works have endured and continue to be studied and appreciated today.</p><p>Kármán's most famous work is the satirical play "The Court of Csejthe", which was inspired by the legend of Elizabeth Báthory, a noblewoman who was rumored to have killed hundreds of young girls. The play was a social criticism of the corruption and abuse of power in the Hungarian aristocracy. Kármán was also known for his advocacy of women's rights, as he addressed themes of gender inequality and women's education in several of his works.</p><p>During his lifetime, Kármán was not widely recognized for his contributions to Hungarian literature. It was only after his death that his works gained popularity and were recognized as important pieces of Hungarian Enlightenment literature. Today, Kármán is considered one of the most prominent Hungarian writers of his time, and his works are widely read and studied in Hungary and around the world.</p><p>In addition to his literary career, József Kármán was also involved in politics. He was a supporter of the French Revolution and its ideas of democracy and social justice. Kármán believed that Hungary needed to modernize and become more democratic, and he used his writing to promote these ideas. He was also critical of the Habsburg monarchy and the Hungarian nobility, calling for greater representation and rights for the middle and lower classes. Kármán's political views, expressed through his writing, made him an important figure in the Hungarian Enlightenment movement and a precursor to the 1848 revolution. Despite his short life, Kármán's impact on Hungarian literature and politics is significant and he remains a celebrated figure in Hungarian cultural history.</p><p>Kármán's family had a long tradition of religious service, with his father serving as a pastor in their local church. However, Kármán was more interested in pursuing a career in the arts and humanities. As a young man, he was deeply influenced by the works of Enlightenment philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire, and he incorporated many of their ideas into his own work.</p><p>In addition to his writing and political activities, Kármán was also known for his wit and humor. He was a popular figure among his friends and colleagues, and his lighthearted nature was reflected in much of his writing. However, Kármán was also deeply committed to his principles and was willing to speak out against injustice and oppression, even at great personal risk.</p><p>Today, Kármán is remembered as a pioneer of Hungarian Enlightenment literature and a champion of democratic ideals. His works continue to be studied and celebrated, both for their literary merit and their historical significance. Despite his untimely death, Kármán's legacy lives on, inspiring generations of Hungarian writers and humanists.</p><p></p><p>
