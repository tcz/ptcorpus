He was recognized as a cultural ambassador for Cuba and was honored with numerous awards throughout his career. Despite his passing in 2000, his music continues to be celebrated and enjoyed around the world.</p><p>Puntillita's parents were both musicians, so he started singing at a young age. He participated in several vocal contests and was a member of various musical groups before joining Conjunto Casino. He gained international fame with Son 14, which he joined in the early 1970s. Puntillita's dynamic performance style made him a sought-after entertainer at home and abroad. He performed in many countries and collaborated with many of the most famous musicians in Cuba, including Tito Puente and Celia Cruz. In addition to his vocals, Puntillita played the maracas and the claves. He was also a composer, and his most famous song, "El que siembra su maíz," was recorded by many musicians in Cuba and elsewhere. Throughout his career, he received the highest honors in Cuba, including the Nacional de la Cultura Distinction, and was invited to perform at the White House during President Clinton's tenure. Puntillita is widely regarded as a master of Cuban music and is remembered for his contributions to the genre.</p><p></p><p>
