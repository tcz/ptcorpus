He was a vocal opponent of fascism and totalitarianism, and spoke out against the rise of Nazism in Germany before and during the war. During his forced labor in the Wehrmacht factory, he continued to resist Nazi ideology by secretly sabotaging equipment and communicating with other prisoners.</p><p>After the war, Ritterband used his platform as a famous actor and activist to advocate for the rights of Holocaust survivors and promote dialogue between Germany and Israel. He recognized the need for reconciliation and worked tirelessly to promote understanding and healing between these two nations.</p><p>Ritterband's life and work continue to inspire people around the world to stand up against injustice and work towards a better future.
