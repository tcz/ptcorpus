(December 22, 1905		Skopje-November 7, 1986			Tirana)


was
an Albanian
personality.


					</p><p>He was a writer, translator, and literary critic. Buza began his studies in Skopje before continuing them in Istanbul, where he engaged with the Turkish cultural scene. He later moved to Tirana, where he worked as a professor of Ottoman language and literature at the Tirana Higher Pedagogical Institute. Buza is perhaps best known for his work as a translator, having translated numerous works from Turkish and Arabic into Albanian. He was also a prolific writer, having published several books on literary criticism and Albanian folklore. In addition to his literary pursuits, Buza was actively involved in politics, serving as a member of the Albanian Parliament from 1945 to 1949.</p><p>Buza was born into a family of intellectuals in Skopje, which at the time was part of the Ottoman Empire. His father was a lawyer and a Sharia judge, and his mother was involved in education. Buza inherited his parents' love of learning and started writing at a young age.</p><p>After completing his studies in Istanbul, Buza returned to his hometown of Skopje and started publishing articles in Albanian newspapers and magazines. In 1944, he joined the Albanian Partisans and became a member of the Communist Party of Albania.</p><p>Buza's political career was short-lived, however. In 1949, he fell out of favor with the Stalinist government and was accused of various crimes, including espionage and plotting to overthrow the government. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison, but was released in 1972 as part of a general amnesty.</p><p>Following his release from prison, Buza returned to his literary pursuits. He continued to write and translate until his death in 1986. Today, he is remembered as one of Albania's most important literary figures and a pioneer of Albanian-Turkish cultural exchange.</p><p></p><p>
