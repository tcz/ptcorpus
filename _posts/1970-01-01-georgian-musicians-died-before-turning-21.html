(April 5, 2015-April 5, 2015)


was
a Georgian
personality.


					</p><p>Akaki Eliava was a Georgian microbiologist and immunologist known for his contributions to the study of phages, specialized viruses that destroy bacteria. He is credited with creating one of the world's first phage therapy centers, which treated thousands of patients for bacterial infections during his time. Eliava was also a prominent figure in Georgian scientific and cultural circles, and served as a member of parliament in the Soviet Union. Despite his short life, his scientific discoveries and contributions have had a lasting impact on medical research and treatment.</p><p>Akaki Eliava was born on April 5, 1892 in the Georgian village of Khevsureti. After completing his early education in Georgia, Eliava moved to Paris to study at the Pasteur Institute. He later returned to Georgia in 1923 and founded the Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology and Virology in Tbilisi, which became a leading center for phage therapy research and treatment.</p><p>Eliava's phage therapy center treated a variety of bacterial infections, including cholera, tuberculosis, and dysentery, with great success. His research also involved the study of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, which was becoming a growing concern at the time.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and medical contributions, Eliava was also an important cultural figure in Georgia. He was a founding member of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences and a prominent supporter of Georgian language and culture during the Soviet era.</p><p>Tragically, Eliava's life was cut short by a grenade explosion at his laboratory on April 5, 1937, his 45th birthday. His legacy, however, lives on through the continued use and study of phage therapy, and the institute he founded remains an important center for scientific research in Georgia.</p><p>Despite his untimely death, Eliava's contributions to phage therapy and microbiology have continued to influence medical research and treatment. His methods of using phages to treat bacterial infections paved the way for future researchers to explore the potential of phage therapy as a viable alternative to antibiotics.The Eliava Institute, which he founded, continues to conduct research and treat patients using phage therapy to this day. In his honor, the institute has been renamed the Eliava Phage Therapy Center, and his life has been commemorated through various awards and honors, including the prestigious State Prize of Georgia in Science and Technology. Eliava's work serves as a testament to the importance of scientific innovation and dedication to public health.</p><p>During his lifetime, Akaki Eliava was recognized for his contributions to science and received numerous awards and honors. He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, one of the highest civilian honors in the Soviet Union, for his groundbreaking work in the field of microbiology. Eliava was also awarded the USSR State Prize, the highest honor in the Soviet Union for scientific and technological achievements, in 1941, four years after his death. </p><p>Eliava's work in phage therapy has also been recognized internationally. In 2006, the Eliava Institute was awarded the Global Health Security Award by the U.S. Department of Defense for its contributions to the field of antimicrobial resistance. In 2015, the institute was recognized by the World Health Organization as a collaborating center for the study and development of phage therapy, highlighting its continued importance in the fight against bacterial infections.</p><p>In addition, Eliava has been the subject of numerous books and documentaries, which have helped to further publicize his groundbreaking research and contributions to science. He remains a respected figure in Georgia and around the world, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of scientists and medical professionals.</p><p>Eliava's work also had a significant impact on the field of medicine during World War II. Phage therapy was used extensively by Soviet doctors to treat wounded soldiers, and it is believed that this method saved many lives. In fact, many of the soldiers treated with phages were able to return to duty within a matter of weeks, whereas those treated with antibiotics took much longer to recover. </p><p>Eliava's contributions to science and medicine have been recognized posthumously in a number of ways. In 1966, the Georgian Academy of Sciences established the Akaki Eliava Medal, which is awarded to scientists for outstanding contributions to microbiology and related fields. In 1995, the Georgian government issued a commemorative coin in his honor to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth. And in 2020, an international conference on phage therapy was held in Tbilisi to celebrate the 125th anniversary of Eliava's birth.</p><p>Today, phage therapy continues to be explored as a potential alternative to antibiotics, particularly as the problem of antibiotic resistance continues to grow. And while much has been learned about phages since Eliava's time, his work remains a cornerstone of the field. His dedication to scientific research and public health – as well as his contributions to Georgian culture and language – have made him a beloved figure in his home country and beyond.</p><p></p><p>
