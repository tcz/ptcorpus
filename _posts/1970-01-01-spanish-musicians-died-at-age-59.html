(November 9, 1930		Portugalete-November 16, 1989			San Salvador)

	
		also known as Ignacio Ellacuria

	
was
a Spanish
personality.


					</p><p>Ignacio Ellacuría was a Jesuit priest, philosopher, theologian, and educator. He was also a prominent scholar of Central American history and politics. Ellacuría spent much of his life in El Salvador, where he taught at the Jesuit-run Universidad Centroamericana (UCA). He was deeply committed to social justice and worked tirelessly to advocate for the rights of the poor and marginalized in El Salvador. </p><p>Ellacuría was a strong critic of the Salvadoran government and the military, who he believed were responsible for the violence and human rights abuses that plagued the country during the 1980s. He was a vocal advocate for peace and often called for a negotiated solution to the armed conflict that was tearing the country apart. </p><p>Unfortunately, Ellacuría's outspoken activism made him a target of the Salvadoran government and military. He was assassinated in November 1989, along with five other Jesuit priests and two employees at the UCA. The massacre, which came to be known as the "UCA Martyrs Massacre," was widely condemned and caused outrage around the world. The killers, members of an elite Salvadoran military unit trained by the United States, were eventually brought to trial and found guilty of the murders. </p><p>Today, Ellacuría's legacy as a crusader for justice and peace in El Salvador lives on. The UCA continues to be a prominent academic institution in the region, and Ellacuría's ideas and writings continue to inspire scholars and activists around the world.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by assassination.
