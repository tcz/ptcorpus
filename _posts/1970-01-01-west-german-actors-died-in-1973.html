						</p><p>
							Mack was a prolific figure in the German film industry during the silent era, directing and producing over 130 films. He is best known for his work in the film genre of "kammerspiel," which focused on intimate and psychological dramas. Mack's most notable works include "Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari" (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari) and "Der Letzte Mann" (The Last Laugh), both of which are highly regarded as masterpieces of German Expressionist cinema. In an unusual move for the time, he left Germany during the rise of the Nazis and settled in Britain where he continued to work in the film industry until his death in 1973. Despite his significant contributions to cinema, Mack's legacy is often overshadowed by the work of his contemporaries such as Fritz Lang and F.W. Murnau. However, today he is remembered as a pioneer of the horror genre and one of the most influential filmmakers of the silent era.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=35911841" title="Wikipedia article about Max Mack">Max Mack on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Willy Fritsch</h2><p><strong>Willy Fritsch</strong>
