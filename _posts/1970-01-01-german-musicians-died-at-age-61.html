(January 17, 1819		Stuttgart-June 7, 1880			Winnenden)


was
a German
philosopher.


					</p><p>Planck was a prominent figure in the field of German Idealism, which emphasized the importance of individual freedom and reason in society. He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Tubingen and wrote several influential works on the subject, including "Der Begriff des Bewusstseins" (The Concept of Consciousness) and "Das Wesen der Seele" (The Essence of the Soul). Planck's philosophical ideas had a significant impact on the development of German philosophical thought in the late 19th century. He was also the brother of physicist Max Planck, who is known for his work on quantum mechanics.</p><p>Karl Christian Planck was born into a family of scholars - his father was a law professor and his grandfather was a theologian. He studied theology, philosophy and philology at the University of Tubingen and later went on to earn his doctorate in philosophy. Planck was deeply influenced by the work of Immanuel Kant and brought his ideas into the German Idealist tradition. He believed that society could only function properly if individuals were free to act and think for themselves, and that reason was the key to moral progress. Planck's work on the nature of consciousness and the soul was particularly innovative, as he sought to reconcile the scientific and philosophical understanding of these concepts. Despite his contributions to the field of philosophy, Planck's ideas were somewhat overshadowed by his brother's achievements in physics. However, his work continued to be studied and admired by later generations of philosophers, and his legacy remains an important part of the German philosophical tradition.</p><p></p><p>

Despite his contributions to the world of music and literature, Rellstab struggled with financial difficulties throughout his life and was unable to achieve the financial success he deserved.</p><p>Rellstab was born in Berlin in 1799 and grew up in a musically inclined family. His father was a cellist and his mother was a singer, which may have influenced his later career as a music critic and librettist. As a young man, Rellstab learned several musical instruments and even attempted a career as a composer before turning to literary pursuits.</p><p>Throughout his career, Rellstab's reviews were known for their incisive analysis and colorful language. He was not afraid to criticize composers or performers he felt were lacking in talent, but he also recognized the greatness of many musicians, including not only Schubert but also Beethoven and Mendelssohn. Rellstab's reviews were closely followed by musicians and music lovers alike, and he was considered one of the most influential critics of his time.</p><p>In addition to his work as a critic, Rellstab was also a respected poet. He published several volumes of verse during his lifetime, and his poetry was celebrated for its lyrical quality and emotional depth. Rellstab's poetry often dealt with themes of love and nature, and he was known for his ability to evoke powerful emotions through his words.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Rellstab struggled financially throughout his life. He was forced to take on a variety of odd jobs to make ends meet, including working as a tutor and a copy editor. Rellstab's financial difficulties may have contributed to his early death in 1860, at the age of 61. Nevertheless, his legacy as a critic, poet, and librettist continues to be celebrated today, and his contributions to the world of music and literature are still recognized and appreciated by scholars and enthusiasts alike.</p><p></p><p>
