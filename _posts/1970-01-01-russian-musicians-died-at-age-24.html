(February 11, 1887		Kiev-September 24, 1911			Kiev)


was
a Russian
personality.


					</p><p>Dmitry Bogrov was a young revolutionary and political activist who joined the Socialist-Revolutionary Party in the early 1900s. He quickly rose up the ranks and was selected to carry out the assassination of Russian politician and monarchist Pyotr Stolypin. Bogrov succeeded in his mission, shooting Stolypin during a theater performance in Kyiv in September 1911.</p><p>However, Bogrov was immediately apprehended and sentenced to death. Some have speculated that he may have acted alone, while others believe he was part of a larger conspiracy. His hanging was carried out just a few days after the assassination and he has become somewhat of a controversial figure in Russian history, with some viewing him as a hero and others seeing him as a terrorist.</p><p>Dmitry Bogrov's family had a long history of revolutionary and political activism. His father was a member of the People's Will organization, which carried out the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881. Bogrov himself became involved in revolutionary activities at a young age, joining the Socialist-Revolutionary Party as a teenager. </p><p>Bogrov's role in the assassination of Stolypin was a turning point in his life, leading to his capture, trial, and eventual execution. Some historians speculate that he may have been acting on his own, driven by personal motivations rather than as part of a larger plot. Others believe that he was connected to a broader conspiracy against Stolypin and the tsarist regime. </p><p>Regardless of the circumstances surrounding his actions, Bogrov's legacy lives on in Russian history. Some see him as a brave revolutionary who gave his life fighting against oppression and tyranny, while others condemn him as a terrorist who took innocent lives to further his political agenda. His story has been the subject of numerous books, films, and other works of art, and continues to be a controversial and fascinating chapter in Russian history.</p><p></p><p>
						He died caused by hanging.
