(November 11, 1961-April 19, 1999)


was
an Albanian
politician.


					</p><p>Born in the village of Prekaz in Kosovo, Ragip Jashari belonged to a prominent family of Kosovo Albanian rebels, who aimed for independence from Serbia. After completing his education, Jashari started working as a teacher and later became involved in politics. </p><p>He was a leading member of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) during the Kosovo War in 1990s. Jashari played a crucial role in organizing and leading the resistance against Serbian forces, and his bravery in combat earned him a reputation as a skilled and fearless fighter. </p><p>However, Jashari's involvement in the KLA ultimately led to his death. On March 5, 1998, Serbian forces attacked his family compound in Prekaz, killing 57 members of his extended family, including women and children. Jashari and his brother were among those killed. The incident, known as the Prekaz massacre, became a turning point in the Kosovo War, galvanizing international support for the Kosovo Albanian cause.</p><p>Today, Ragip Jashari is remembered as a hero and martyr of Kosovo's struggle for independence. His memory and legacy are celebrated each year on February 28, the day of the KLA's founding, and on April 19, the anniversary of the Prekaz massacre.</p><p>In addition to his leadership in the KLA, Ragip Jashari was also respected for his contributions to local government in Kosovo. He served as a member of the municipal council in Srbica and worked to improve living conditions for Kosovo Albanians. Jashari was also a strong advocate for human rights and democracy, and he believed that Kosovo's Albanian population should have the right to self-determination. His legacy continues to inspire many young people in Kosovo to pursue careers in politics and public service, and his name remains synonymous with the fight for independence and freedom. In his honor, many streets, schools, and buildings have been named after him throughout Kosovo.</p><p>Ragip Jashari is survived by his wife and two children, who escaped the attack on his family compound. After his death, his wife, Adem Jashari, became a prominent figure in Kosovo's independence movement and was elected to the Kosovo Parliament. Jashari's legacy also extended beyond Kosovo, with many cities around the world holding commemorations in his memory. In 2018, the Albanian government posthumously awarded Jashari with the Order of the National Flag, the highest honor given by the state, in recognition of his contributions to Albanian independence and statehood. Jashari's life and death are a testament to the resilience and bravery of the Kosovo Albanian people in the face of oppression and persecution, and his memory continues to inspire future generations to fight for justice and freedom.</p><p></p><p>
