(April 5, 2015		Tra Vinh Province-December 22, 1972			Beijing)


was
a Cambodian
politician.


					</p><p>He was better known by his nickname "Comrade Seray" and was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kampuchea. Minh was a key figure in the Khmer Rouge regime that ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. He was responsible for overseeing the regime's propaganda and education programs, and was a close associate of Pol Pot, the leader of the Khmer Rouge. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, Minh went into exile and was later tried and convicted in absentia for war crimes and crimes against humanity by a UN-backed tribunal. He died in Beijing in 1998.</p><p>During his time in the Khmer Rouge regime, Comrade Seray was known for his intense dedication to the ideology of communism and played a crucial role in the party's indoctrination process. He was also instrumental in the establishment of the infamous Tuol Sleng prison, where thousands of Cambodians were tortured and executed. Despite his involvement in the regime's crimes, some scholars suggest that Minh may have had disagreements with Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge leadership, as evidenced by his brief stint in prison in 1976. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, Minh maintained a low profile in China and refused to speak to journalists or testify in the trials of his former colleagues. He remained a divisive figure in Cambodia even decades after his death, with some seeing him as a ruthless ideologue and others as a victim of circumstance.</p><p></p><p>
