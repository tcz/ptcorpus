(January 5, 1935		Tehran-February 13, 1967			Darband, Tehran)

	
		a.k.a. Forugh Farrojzad or Forugh Farrokhzad

	
was
an Iranian
writer, film director, poet and film editor.


					
			
		She had
		two
		children,
		Kāmyār Shapour and Hossein Mansouri.

						</p><p>Forough Farrokhzad is considered one of the most influential figures in Persian literature and a pioneer of Iran's modernist poetry movement. She began writing poetry at a young age, and her work often explored themes of love, gender inequality, and social stigma. Her poetry was often controversial due to its liberal and feminist themes, and she faced criticism from conservative groups during her lifetime.</p><p>In addition to being a poet, Forough Farrokhzad was also a filmmaker. She directed several documentaries and short films, including the acclaimed "The House is Black," which was a haunting portrayal of a leper colony. Her work as a filmmaker was groundbreaking for Iranian cinema, and it has been highly influential in both Iranian and international filmmaking.</p><p>Farrokhzad's legacy continues to impact Persian literature and art to this day. She remains a celebrated figure in Iranian culture for her boldness and artistry in confronting social issues through her poetry and films.</p><p>Farrokhzad's upbringing was marked by tragedy and difficulty. Her parents divorced when she was young, and she was raised primarily by her mother and stepfather. She was sent to boarding school, but she was expelled for her rebellious behavior. She eventually married at a young age, but her husband was abusive, and they divorced after just two years. These experiences would shape much of her later work and themes as a poet and filmmaker.</p><p>In addition to her creative pursuits, Farrokhzad was also involved in activism and humanitarian work. She worked with children who had lost their parents in the devastating 1962 earthquake in Iran, and she also championed women's rights and literacy initiatives. Despite facing criticism and even censorship from the Iranian government during her lifetime, Farrokhzad's work has endured and continues to inspire new generations of writers and artists in Iran and beyond.</p><p></p><p>

(April 5, 2015		Isfahan-September 15, 1982			Tehran)


was
an Iranian
politician.


					</p><p>He held various positions in the government of Iran, including serving as the Minister of Foreign Affairs under Prime Minister Mohammad-Ali Rajai from August 1981 until his resignation in September 1981. Ghotbzadeh was known for his strong opposition to the Shah's regime and his role in organizing the Islamic Revolution in Iran. However, his involvement in politics came to an end after he fell out of favor with Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution, over his handling of the Iran-Iraq War. Ghotbzadeh was arrested in August 1982 and later executed by the government in September of the same year on charges of plotting to overthrow the Islamic Republic. His death remains controversial and has been the subject of much debate in Iran and around the world.</p><p>Ghotbzadeh was born to an aristocratic family in Isfahan, Iran. He studied political science and economics at the University of Tehran and later went on to study in the United States, where he attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Ghotbzadeh was an active member of the Iranian Students Association during his time in the U.S., where he became involved in the movement to overthrow the Shah.</p><p>After returning to Iran in 1979 following the Islamic Revolution, Ghotbzadeh became a key figure in the new government. He was appointed as the deputy foreign minister under Ebrahim Yazdi, and later became the spokesman for the government. In 1981, he was appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, becoming the youngest person to hold the position in the history of Iran.</p><p>During his tenure as foreign minister, Ghotbzadeh played a significant role in Iran's foreign policy, particularly in relation to the Iran-Iraq War. He was known for advocating for a negotiated settlement to the conflict, but his position was at odds with the more hawkish elements of the government. This, along with his outspoken and sometimes controversial statements, ultimately led to his fall from power.</p><p>Despite his political downfall and eventual execution, Ghotbzadeh remains a controversial figure in Iran. Some see him as a martyr and hero of the Islamic Revolution, while others view him as a traitor who betrayed the ideals of the revolution. His legacy continues to be debated by Iranians and scholars around the world.</p><p></p><p>
