a Brazilian
actor.


						</p><p>
							He gained notoriety for his role as the titular character in the film "Pixote, a Lei do Mais Fraco" (Pixote, the Law of the Weakest) directed by Hector Babenco in 1981. The film depicts the grim life of a group of impoverished children and teenagers who turn to crime to survive on the streets of São Paulo. Ramos Da Silva was only 11 years old when he was cast in the lead role, and his naturalistic and heartbreaking performance earned him critical acclaim both in Brazil and internationally. Unfortunately, his promising acting career was cut short in 1987 when he was shot and killed by police while trying to steal a car. He was only 19 years old at the time of his death, but his legacy lives on through his poignant portrayal of Pixote, a symbol of the social inequality and violence that plagued Brazil's urban landscape in the 1980s.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=42600635" title="Wikipedia article about Fernando Ramos Da Silva">Fernando Ramos Da Silva on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/mexican-actors-died-in-1958.html' title='Mexican actors died in 1958'><strong>Mexican actors died in 1958</strong> List of the top 2 Mexican actors who died in 1958</a></li><li><a href='/mexican-actors-died-in-2010.html' title='Mexican actors died in 2010'><strong>Mexican actors died in 2010</strong> List of the top 4 Mexican actors who died in 2010</a></li><li><a href='/english-musicians-died-at-age-37.html' title='English musicians died at age 37'><strong>English musicians died at age 37</strong> List of the top 3 English music stars who died when they were 37</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/iranian-musicians-died-at-age-53.html' title='Iranian musicians died at age 53'><strong>Iranian musicians died at age 53</strong> List of the top 3 Iranian music stars who died when they were 53</a></li><li><a href='/west-german-actors-died-in-1992.html' title='West German actors died in 1992'><strong>West German actors died in 1992</strong> List of the top 1 West German actors who died in 1992</a></li><li><a href='/french-actors-died-at-age-78.html' title='French actors died at age 78'><strong>French actors died at age 78</strong> List of the top 14 French actors who died when they were 78</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
