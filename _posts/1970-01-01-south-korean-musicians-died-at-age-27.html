(February 24, 1955		Busan-April 27, 1982			Uiryeong County)


was
a South Korean
personality.


					</p><p>Woo Bum-kon was a former South Korean police officer who is infamously known for the deadliest spree killing in South Korean history. On April 26, 1982, he killed 56 people and injured 35 others in a shooting rampage in the rural town of Uiryeong County. The next day, he died by suicide after lighting his house on fire.</p><p>Woo had a troubled background and was discharged from the police force after being accused of stealing a weapon. It's believed that his motive for the shooting spree was revenge against the police force and society in general for the mistreatment he had faced. The tragedy deeply shocked and traumatized the Korean people, and led to major changes in the country's gun laws and mental health policies.</p><p>Woo Bum-kon was born in Busan, South Korea, in 1955 as the eldest of five siblings. He grew up in a poor family and had to drop out of high school due to financial difficulties. In 1974, he joined the South Korean police force as a young recruit. However, he was soon involved in a string of disciplinary incidents, including accusations of theft and assault. He was ultimately dismissed from the police force in 1981 due to his disciplinary record.</p><p>After his dismissal, Woo became increasingly isolated and developed a grudge against the police and society in general. He withdrew from his family and friends, and spent most of his time alone in his small house in Uiryeong County, where the shooting spree occurred.</p><p>On the evening of April 26, 1982, Woo set out on a shooting rampage that lasted for hours. He first killed his wife and baby daughter, and then drove around the county randomly shooting people on the streets and in their houses. Some of his victims were members of his own family or acquaintances. The rampage finally ended when Woo set his house on fire and shot himself before the police could capture him.</p><p>The Uiryeong County shooting spree shocked the South Korean society and led to a national debate on gun control and mental health care. The tragedy also inspired several songs, movies, and books in Korea that explored Woo's background and motives. However, the legacy of the shooting spree still haunts the local community, and many of the victims' families and survivors struggle with the trauma to this day.</p><p>Woo Bum-kon's shooting spree was one of the deadliest in world history at the time, and it remains one of the worst crimes committed by a single person in South Korea. The aftermath of the tragedy led to significant changes in the country's gun control legislation, mental health policies, and law enforcement practices. In response to the shooting, South Korea banned civilian possession of all firearms except for hunting rifles and shotguns, and increased the penalties for illegal possession and use of guns. The country also expanded its mental health care services and education programs to raise awareness about mental illness and reduce the stigma associated with seeking help. Additionally, the South Korean government established a special task force to investigate mass shootings and other violent crimes, and to develop preventive measures to address them. Despite these efforts, however, South Korea has experienced several other mass shootings in recent years, indicating that the issue is still a major challenge for the country.</p><p></p><p>
