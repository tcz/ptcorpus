(January 6, 1776		Bannewitz-May 31, 1809			Stralsund)


was
a German
personality.


					</p><p>He was a Prussian major who became famous for his brave and daring attempts to liberate his home country from Napoleon's French Empire. In 1809, von Schill led an army of Prussian volunteers in a campaign against French-occupied Germany. Although initially successful, his forces were eventually defeated by Napoleon's armies, and von Schill was killed in the battle of Stralsund. Despite his ultimate failure, von Schill's bravery and patriotism have made him a revered figure in German history. To this day, he is remembered as a symbol of resistance against foreign oppression and a symbol of German nationalism.</p><p>Ferdinand von Schill was born into a family of minor nobility in the Electorate of Saxony. He joined the Prussian army in 1794 and fought in the War of the Second Coalition against revolutionary France. After Napoleon's victory at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806, von Schill was among the Prussian officers who refused to surrender and instead went into exile in Sweden. </p><p>In 1809, von Schill returned to Germany with Swedish support and invaded the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, which was a French satellite state. He won several victories and succeeded in raising thousands of volunteers to his cause. However, lacking proper supplies and reinforcements, von Schill's army was eventually surrounded by Napoleon's troops in the port city of Stralsund. In the ensuing battle, von Schill was killed along with most of his men. </p><p>Despite his relatively short military career, von Schill's reputation as a hero and martyr spread quickly throughout Germany. Poets and musicians honored his memory in their works, and monuments were erected in his honor. He was widely seen as a symbol of the Prussian spirit and the struggle against foreign domination. Some historians consider him a precursor to the broader movement for German unification that arose in the 19th century.</p><p></p><p>
