personality.


					</p><p>She was a feminist and a revolutionary who played an important role during the Indian independence movement. Pritilata was the first female activist of the Chittagong armoury raid in 1932, where she led an attack on the Pahartali European Club, a symbol of British oppression. One of her most famous quotes is "My life is dedicated to my country." Despite the imminent danger, Pritilata preferred to fight for her country's independence rather than live under British colonial rule. Unfortunately, she lost her life during the raid and became a martyr for the cause. Today, Pritilata is remembered as a national hero in Bangladesh and is an inspiration for generations of women who have followed in her footsteps.</p><p>Pritilata was born to a middle-class family in Chittagong and received her education in Kolkata. She was a brilliant student and completed her Masters in Philosophy from the University of Calcutta. She was deeply influenced by the principles of nationalism and patriotism, which led her to join the Indian independence movement. Pritilata joined the Indian Republican Army (IRA), a revolutionary group that aimed to overthrow British colonial rule in India.</p><p>Apart from her involvement in the Chittagong armoury raid, Pritilata also organized and participated in several underground activities to fight against the British. She was known for her charismatic leadership and fearlessness in the face of danger.</p><p>Pritilata's sacrifice and bravery have been celebrated in various forms of art and literature in Bangladesh. Several institutions, including schools and colleges, have been named after her. The Bangladesh government posthumously conferred upon her the Swadhinata Sammanona, the country's highest civilian award, in 2011, on her birth centenary. Today, Pritilata remains an inspiration to women across Bangladesh and beyond, who continue to fight for equality and social justice.</p><p></p><p>
