					</p><p>Correction: Bronisław Malinowski (April 7, 1884 Poland - May 16, 1942 New Haven, Connecticut, United States) was a British social anthropologist of Polish origin. He is considered one of the most influential anthropologists of the 20th century, known for developing the field of participant observation in ethnographic research. Malinowski conducted extensive fieldwork in Melanesia and published numerous works on the indigenous peoples of the region, including Argonauts of the Western Pacific and Coral Gardens and Their Magic. He has been credited with revolutionizing the study of anthropology and shaping modern social science.</p><p>Malinowski was born in Krakow, Poland to a family of intellectuals. He studied physics and mathematics at the Jagiellonian University before developing an interest in anthropology. He went on to study at the London School of Economics under the influential anthropologist, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown.</p><p>Malinowski is particularly known for his method of participant observation, in which researchers immerse themselves in the culture they are studying in order to gain a deep understanding of their subjects. This approach was a departure from previous methods in anthropology in which researchers studied their subjects from a distance.</p><p>Throughout his career, Malinowski conducted extensive fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands, off the coast of New Guinea. He spent several years living among the islanders and learning their language and customs. His studies culminated in the publication of his most famous work, Argonauts of the Western Pacific. In it, Malinowski developed the concept of the "kula ring," a complex system of gift-giving and exchange among the islanders which he argued was central to their social and economic systems.</p><p>Malinowski went on to hold academic posts at various universities in Europe and the United States, including the University of London and Yale University. He continued to conduct fieldwork and publish extensively throughout his life, including his posthumously published diary, A Diary in the Strict Sense of the Term.</p><p>Malinowski's contributions to anthropology have had a lasting impact on the field, influencing generations of researchers and shaping our understanding of the complexities of culture and society.</p><p></p><p>
