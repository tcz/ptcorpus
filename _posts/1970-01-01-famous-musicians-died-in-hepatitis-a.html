an English
actor.


					</p><p>He was best known for his role as Mr. Humphries in the British sitcom "Are You Being Served?" which ran from 1972-1985. Inman's portrayal of Mr. Humphries, a camp and flamboyant menswear salesman, made him a beloved figure in British television history. Inman began his acting career in the 1960s and made appearances in several television shows and films before his iconic role in "Are You Being Served?" He was also a talented stage actor, appearing in numerous productions in London's West End. Inman never publicly came out as gay during his lifetime but was known to be a trailblazer in portraying gay characters on television at a time when it was still taboo. He passed away in 2007 at the age of 71 after suffering from Hepatitis A.</p><p>Inman had a difficult childhood and was sent to live with an aunt in Blackpool after his parents separated. He left school at the age of 13 and worked various jobs, including as a window dresser and a hotel porter, before pursuing a career in acting. In addition to his work on television and stage, Inman was also a talented singer and released several singles in the 1970s, including a cover of the Doris Day song "I Enjoy Being a Girl." Inman was a private person and little is known about his personal life, although he was known to have had a long-term partner, Ron Lynch, who died in 2002. Despite being a popular figure in British television, Inman's career suffered in the 1980s due to the changing attitudes towards representations of homosexuality on screen. However, he continued to work in theatre, including a successful production of "Aladdin" in which he played Widow Twankey. Inman's legacy as an iconic figure in British television history has endured, with his character Mr. Humphries becoming a symbol of LGBTQ+ representation and visibility.</p><p></p><p>
