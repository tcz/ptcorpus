(April 24, 1906		Brooklyn-January 3, 1946			HM Prison Wandsworth)

	
		a.k.a. Lord Haw Haw or Joyce, William

	
was
an Irish
politician.


					</p><p>William Joyce was actually a notorious fascist politician and propagandist who was born in Brooklyn to an Irish immigrant family. He moved to England with his family as a child and later became a naturalized British citizen. During World War II, Joyce became a prominent figure in fascist and Nazi propaganda, broadcasting radio propaganda on behalf of the Germans under the nickname "Lord Haw Haw". He was known for his British-accented English and mocking tone towards the British people. In 1945, he was captured by British forces and brought to trial for treason, resulting in his hanging in 1946 at HM Prison Wandsworth. His execution was controversial and sparked debate about the legality of executing someone for treason when they were not a citizen of the country they were accused of betraying.</p><p>Joyce was a highly controversial figure during his time, with some regarding him as a traitor while others saw him as a misunderstood outsider. He was known for his anti-Semitic views and support of Adolf Hitler, and his broadcasts were intended to demoralize the British public during the war. Joyce's trial and execution were seen as a pivotal moment in post-war Britain, with many reflecting on the dangers of extremist views and nationalism. Despite his notoriety, Joyce remains a figure of interest for historians and political scholars, with many continuing to analyze his motivations and influence.</p><p>Despite his controversial and infamous reputation, William Joyce's childhood was relatively ordinary. He attended school in England and later worked as a golf caddy and journalist. It wasn't until the 1930s that he became involved in far-right politics and began associating with various fascist groups. He eventually joined the British Union of Fascists led by Oswald Mosley and became a prominent member. </p><p>After the outbreak of World War II, Joyce fled to Germany and began working for Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, who recognized Joyce's talent for broadcasting. Joyce's radio broadcasts, which were heard by millions of British listeners, were designed to undermine morale and encourage defeatism. </p><p>Joyce's arrest and trial for treason were controversial, as the British government accused him of betraying a country he wasn't a citizen of. Despite this, he was found guilty and later executed. Many historians have debated his legacy and the impact of his propaganda broadcasts.</p><p>Joyce's wife, Margaret, also played a pivotal role in his life and career. The two married in 1937 and later moved to Germany together. Margaret was also involved in fascist politics and even took on the role of broadcasting propaganda on behalf of the Germans in a program aimed at British female listeners. She was arrested after the war and served a prison sentence for her involvement in Nazi propaganda activities. </p><p>Joyce's influence and notoriety continue to be felt today. He remains a symbol of the dangers of extremist views and propaganda, and his case has been cited in debates about free speech and the limits of political expression. Despite his infamy, Joyce's life and career remain a subject of fascination and study for many, as historians and political scholars continue to explore the depths of his motivations and beliefs.</p><p>Joyce's execution sparked controversy and debate about the fairness of his trial and the use of capital punishment. Many argued that his execution was politically motivated and that he should have been given a lighter sentence. Others believed that he deserved his fate and that his actions during the war were unforgivable. Despite this, Joyce's legacy continues to be felt in modern times, with his propaganda techniques and extremist views still being studied and analyzed by scholars today. The story of William Joyce serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hate speech and the impact it can have on society.</p><p></p><p>
