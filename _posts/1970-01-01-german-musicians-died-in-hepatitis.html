						Wolfgang Borchert, born in Hamburg, Germany in 1921, is best known for his anti-war works after experiencing the brutality of the Nazi regime during World War II. Borchert was drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1941 and was sent to fight on the Eastern Front, where he was wounded and eventually captured by Allied forces in 1945. After his release, Borchert began writing and publishing works that spoke out against war and tyranny. His most famous play, "Draußen vor der Tür" ("The Man Outside"), was first performed in 1947 and became a symbol of the disillusionment and despair felt by many Germans in the post-war period. Borchert died later that year at the age of 26 due to complications from his war injuries. Despite his short life, Borchert's works continue to be studied and celebrated for their powerful messages and poignant reflections on the human experience.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=685185" title="Wikipedia article about Wolfgang Borchert">Wolfgang Borchert on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/french-musicians-born-in-1911.html' title='French musicians born in 1911'><strong>French musicians born in 1911</strong> List of the top 7 French  music stars who died in who were born in 1911</a></li><li><a href='/german-actresses-died-in-1958.html' title='German actresses died in 1958'><strong>German actresses died in 1958</strong> List of the top 3 German actresses who died in 1958</a></li><li><a href='/american-musicians-born-in-1939.html' title='American musicians born in 1939'><strong>American musicians born in 1939</strong> List of the top 50 American  music stars who died in who were born in 1939</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/italian-musicians-died-at-age-51.html' title='Italian musicians died at age 51'><strong>Italian musicians died at age 51</strong> List of the top 5 Italian music stars who died when they were 51</a></li><li><a href='/thai-musicians-died-at-age-44.html' title='Thai musicians died at age 44'><strong>Thai musicians died at age 44</strong> List of the top 2 Thai music stars who died when they were 44</a></li><li><a href='/finnish-actresses-died-in-1951.html' title='Finnish actresses died in 1951'><strong>Finnish actresses died in 1951</strong> List of the top 1 Finnish actresses who died in 1951</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
