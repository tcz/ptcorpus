(August 14, 1878		Prousos-February 1, 1936			Athens)


was
a Greek
personality.


					</p><p>He was a prominent military officer and politician, serving as Prime Minister of Greece on three separate occasions. Kondylis played a significant role in Greek politics, especially during the interwar period, and is considered to be one of the most controversial figures in modern Greek history. He first rose to prominence during the Balkan Wars, and went on to serve as Minister of Defense and War in several cabinet positions. </p><p>Kondylis' political career was marked by a number of controversial decisions, including his role in the establishment of a right-wing dictatorship in Greece in 1935, which he led until his death the following year. Despite his controversial legacy, Kondylis was widely admired for his military leadership and his efforts to modernize the Greek Army. He also played a key role in the reunification of Greece with Thrace and Macedonia after the First World War.</p><p>In addition to his military and political career, Georgios Kondylis was also an accomplished linguist and author, fluent in several languages including French, Italian, and German. He wrote several books on military strategy, including "The Evolution of Military Organization" and "The General Staff of the Greek Army," which remain influential works to this day. Kondylis was also a talented athlete and avid sportsman, participating in a variety of sports such as tennis, fencing, and boxing. He was known for his physical fitness and endurance, which served him well in his military career. Despite his controversial reputation, Kondylis was widely respected by his peers and subordinates for his leadership abilities, his dedication to duty, and his commitment to Greece and its people. His legacy continues to be a subject of debate and discussion among historians and scholars of Greek politics and history.</p><p>During his second term as Prime Minister, Kondylis contributed to the restoration of the monarchy in Greece, after the ousting of republican Prime Minister Eleutherios Venizelos. He was also instrumental in negotiating the Treaty of Lausanne with Turkey in 1923, which recognized the modern borders of Greece and established a population exchange between Greece and Turkey. </p><p>Kondylis' role in the establishment of a dictatorship in 1935 was preceded by a period of political turmoil and uncertainty in Greece. The country was facing economic hardship and social unrest, and there was growing opposition to the ruling government. Kondylis saw the dictatorship as a means of restoring stability and order to the country, and he was able to gain the support of the military and the monarchy in this endeavor. </p><p>Despite his authoritarian tendencies, Kondylis' legacy as a military leader and strategist cannot be denied. He introduced a number of important reforms to the Greek Army, including the introduction of modern weapons and tactics, the creation of a central military academy, and the establishment of a permanent General Staff. Kondylis was also a skilled diplomat, and he played an important role in Greek foreign policy during his time in office. </p><p>Today, Kondylis is remembered as a controversial and complex figure in Greek history. His contributions to the military and political arenas are recognized, but his role in the establishment of a dictatorship is also widely criticized. His legacy continues to be a subject of discussion and debate among scholars and historians.</p><p></p><p>
