					</p><p>Alexander Nahum Sack was an Estonian lawyer and legal philosopher who made significant contributions to the development of modern civil law. Born in Moscow, Sack graduated from the University of St. Petersburg and went on to teach at the University of Tartu in Estonia. He also practiced law and was a judge in the Estonian legal system. </p><p>Sack is best known for his work in formulating the concept of the "unified system of law" and for his ideas on legal transplants, which have had a major impact on comparative law. He argued that legal systems are shaped by the culture and history of their society, and that legal transplants should take into account these factors to be effective. In addition to his legal work, Sack was an advocate for the rights of minorities, particularly the Jewish people.</p><p>Despite his contributions to Estonian law, Sack was forced to flee the country in 1940 due to the Soviet occupation. He eventually settled in the United States, where he continued to teach and write on legal topics until his death in 1955.</p><p>In the United States, Alexander Nahum Sack became a professor of law at New York University School of Law. He also taught at Columbia Law School and the University of Michigan Law School. Sack's most notable works include "The Birth of the New Justice" and "Treasury of the Law of Nations". His theoretical framework was highly influential in shaping the modern study of comparative law. Sack was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the International Academy of Comparative Law, and the Institute of Jewish Affairs. He was also a recipient of the Legion of Honor, France's highest award for civilians. Today, Sack is recognized as one of the foremost legal thinkers of the 20th century. His ideas on legal transplants continue to guide the development of legal systems around the world.</p><p>Alexander Nahum Sack was born to a Jewish family in Moscow in 1890. He was raised in St. Petersburg where he attended gymnasium before enrolling at the University of St. Petersburg, where he received a degree in law in 1914. After graduation, he worked as a lawyer in St. Petersburg before moving to Estonia in 1917.</p><p>In Estonia, Sack became a professor of law at the University of Tartu and quickly rose to prominence in the legal community. He played an important role in drafting the Estonian Civil Code of 1939, which applied to all citizens and residents of Estonia regardless of their ethnicity. He also served as a judge in the Estonian legal system and was known for his fairness and impartiality.</p><p>Sack's contributions to legal theory were groundbreaking. He believed that legal systems were shaped by the culture and history of their society and that comparative law should take into account these factors. He argued that it was possible to transplant legal concepts and principles from one society to another, but that this could only be done successfully if the transplant was adapted to fit the cultural context of the receiving society.</p><p>Following the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940, Sack was forced to leave the country along with many other Estonian intellectuals. He eventually settled in the United States, where he continued to teach and write on legal topics until his death in 1955.</p><p>Sack's legacy is still felt in the field of comparative law, where his ideas on legal transplants continue to be influential. He is remembered as a brilliant legal mind and a champion of human rights.</p><p></p><p>
