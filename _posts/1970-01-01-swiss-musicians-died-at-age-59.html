(June 4, 1785		Montagnola-February 26, 1845			Milan)


was
a Swiss
architect.


					</p><p>He trained in Milan and Paris, and his work reflects the influences of neoclassical and romantic styles. Gilardi designed numerous buildings in Switzerland, Italy, and France, including the neo-gothic Church of St. Joseph in Lausanne, the Palazzo del Comune in Meride, and the Villa Litta in Milan.

(September 7, 1524		Baden-December 31, 1583			Basel)


was
a Swiss
physician.


					</p><p>He is known for his work as a theologian and his contributions to the development of Protestantism. Born in Baden, Switzerland in 1524, Erastus studied philosophy and medicine at the University of Basel. He developed an interest in theology and became a disciple of Huldrych Zwingli, a leading figure of the Swiss Reformation. </p><p>Erastus became a professor of medicine at the University of Heidelberg in 1558, where he also taught theology. He was a strong advocate for church discipline, arguing that the church should have the power to excommunicate members who did not adhere to its teachings. This belief led to the development of what is now known as "Erastianism," a theory that asserts the state's authority over the church. </p><p>Erastus is best known for his work on religious disputes and excommunication. His work, "Explicatio gravissimae quaestionis, utrum excommunicatio, quae ab una ecclesia fit, a cunctis aliis, quae ejusdem sunt consitionis et reformationis, sit manenda," argued that excommunication should only be carried out by the church in which the individual was a member. </p><p>Erastus died in 1583 in Basel, leaving behind a legacy as a prominent theologian and physician. His contributions to the development of the Protestant movement in Switzerland and beyond continue to be studied and discussed to this day.</p><p>Erastus’ views on excommunication were influential in the Protestant Reformation, and his beliefs on church discipline were adopted by the Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches. Besides his theological work, Erastus made significant contributions to medical science. He believed in the medical treatment of diseases, rather than relying on magic or astrology. He also advocated for the sterilization of instruments before surgery, and encouraged doctors to wash their hands before treating patients. Erastus played a key role in the establishment of the University of Heidelberg's medical school, and later became the court physician to Elector Palatine. Despite his success, Erastus was not without controversy. He was accused of being a crypto-Calvinist by his opponents, and was criticized for his views on predestination. Nonetheless, his legacy as an accomplished physician and theologian endures, and his work continues to be studied and debated by scholars and theologians.</p><p></p><p>
