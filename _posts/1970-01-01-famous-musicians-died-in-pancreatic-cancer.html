(July 15, 1930		El Biar-October 9, 2004			Paris)

	
		a.k.a. Derrida, Jacques

	
was
a French
philosopher.


					
			
		He had
		one
		child,
		Pierre Alféri.

						</p><p>Derrida is best known for developing the philosophical approach known as deconstruction. This approach involves the analysis of texts to uncover and challenge underlying assumptions and inherent contradictions. Derrida's work also often focused on language and communication, exploring how meaning is constructed and communicated through language. He was a prolific writer and published numerous influential books and articles throughout his career. Some of his most notable works include "Of Grammatology," "Writing and Difference," and "Dissemination." Despite his significant contributions to philosophy, Derrida was also a controversial figure, with some critics arguing that his work was overly complex and inaccessible. Nevertheless, his ideas continue to influence philosophy, literary criticism, and cultural studies today.</p><p>Derrida was born to an Algerian Jewish family, and his work often engaged with questions of identity, race, and colonialism. He studied at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris and later became a professor at a number of universities, including the University of California, Irvine, and the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris. He was a leading figure in the intellectual movement known as post-structuralism, and his work has had a major impact on literary theory, cultural studies, and critical theory. In addition to his philosophical work, Derrida was also engaged in activism, particularly around issues of refugees and immigration. He was a vocal critic of the French government's treatment of immigrants, and he worked to support organizations that provided assistance to refugees.</p><p>Derrida's philosophical work has been widely translated and influential throughout the world. He was awarded numerous honors and awards throughout his career, including the International Balzan Prize for Philosophy in 2004. Derrida was also known for his engaging and charismatic teaching style, and he was a beloved mentor and advisor to many students and colleagues. His lectures and seminars were often standing-room-only events, attracting audiences from around the world. Derrida's legacy continues to shape contemporary philosophy and his critical approach to language and communication has influenced fields as diverse as anthropology, art criticism, and media studies.</p><p>Derrida's impact on philosophy goes beyond the theoretical realm, as his ideas also found practical applications in fields such as law and politics. He was particularly influential in the development of postmodern legal theory, where his ideas on deconstruction were used to challenge traditional modes of legal interpretation. In the political arena, Derrida's work on language and power shed light on the ways in which political discourse can be used to manipulate and control populations. Derrida also contributed to the development of feminist theory, encouraging readers to question the gendered assumptions that underpin our cultural and linguistic practices. </p><p>In addition to his academic work, Derrida was a dedicated public intellectual, often engaging with broader social and political issues. He was known for his activism around issues of social justice, including his support for anti-apartheid movements in South Africa and his involvement in organizing protests against French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. His work on the topic of hospitality, which investigates the ethical obligation to receive and care for guests, found political expression in his advocacy for immigrant and refugee rights.</p><p>Despite his passing in 2004, Derrida's work continues to inspire new generations of thinkers and scholars. His critiques of traditional modes of thought and his emphasis on the fluidity of language and meaning have opened up new avenues for inquiry and debate, shaping our understanding of the world around us. His intellectual legacy is a testament to the enduring power of ideas to transform the ways we think, communicate, and relate to one another.</p><p></p><p>

His radio show, "The Jack Benny Program," became one of the most popular shows in broadcasting history and ran for over 20 years. In addition to his work in radio, Benny was also a successful television and film actor, appearing in movies such as "To Be or Not to Be" and "The Horn Blows at Midnight." His career spanned over five decades and he remains a beloved and influential figure in American comedy.</p><p>Despite his character's persona, Jack Benny was known for his generosity off-screen. He was also an accomplished violinist and often incorporated his musical skills into his comedy routines. Benny was a pioneer in the use of comic timing and was admired by many comedians who followed in his footsteps. He received numerous awards throughout his career, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Kennedy Center Honors. After his death in 1974, his estate established the Jack Benny Memorial Scholarship Fund, which provides financial assistance to college students pursuing careers in the fine arts.</p><p>Benny's career in show business began when he was just 17 years old, performing in a talent show at the local vaudeville theater in Waukegan, Illinois. He soon teamed up with fellow comedian and future collaborator, Zeppo Marx, and began touring the vaudeville circuit. Benny's success on the stage led to his first radio show in 1932, and his quick wit and impeccable timing made him a natural fit for the medium.</p><p>Over the years, Benny developed a loyal fan base and cultivated lasting friendships with many of his colleagues in the entertainment industry, including George Burns, Bob Hope, and Frank Sinatra.

They met in 1926 when she was working as a singer on the same vaudeville circuit as Benny. Though they faced some opposition to their marriage due to their different religious backgrounds (Benny was Jewish and Livingstone was Catholic), they remained married until his death in 1974. Livingstone herself was a talented comedian and performer and was an integral part of Benny's shows, often playing the straight man to his comedic antics. </p><p>In addition to his work in entertainment, Benny was also an avid sports fan, particularly of horse racing. He owned several racehorses and was a frequent visitor to tracks across the country. He was also an enthusiastic amateur photographer and often took candid shots of his friends and colleagues. </p><p>Benny's legacy lives on through his recordings, which continue to be popular with fans of classic comedy, and through the annual Jack Benny Awards, which are presented to young comedians and performers by his estate. His impact on American popular culture remains significant, and his timeless humor continues to bring joy to audiences of all ages.</p><p></p><p>
