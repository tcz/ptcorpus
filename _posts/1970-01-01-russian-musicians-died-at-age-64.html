						</p><p>Turgenev was one of the most prominent figures of Russian literature in the 19th century and is best known for his novel "Fathers and Sons" which explores the generation gap between traditionalists and radicals in Russia. He also wrote several other works including "A Month in the Country" and "On the Eve". Turgenev spent much of his life abroad, living in France and Germany for extended periods of time. He was a friend of many other famous writers, including Gustave Flaubert and Henry James, and his work had a profound influence on the development of modernist literature in Russia. Despite the controversy surrounding some of his works, Turgenev continues to be widely read and respected today.</p><p>Turgenev was born into a wealthy family and received a privileged education, studying at the University of Moscow and the University of Saint Petersburg. He initially pursued a career in civil service, but his passion for writing led him to publish his first book, "A Sportsman's Sketches", in 1852. The book was a critical success, and Turgenev went on to become one of the most popular and influential writers of his time.</p><p>In addition to his novels and plays, Turgenev was also known for his essays and political commentary. He was a staunch advocate for the abolition of serfdom in Russia and was highly critical of the government's handling of social and political issues. This earned him the ire of some government officials and conservative critics, but only increased his popularity among liberal readers.</p><p>Turgenev was also known for his complicated personal life, which included numerous love affairs and a long-standing feud with fellow writer Fyodor Dostoevsky. Despite these controversies, however, Turgenev remained dedicated to his craft and continued to produce some of the most enduring works of literature in Russian history until his death in 1883.</p><p></p><p>

photographer, artist and visual artist.


					</p><p>He was a pioneer of Constructivism, a movement that was characterized by an emphasis on the practical and functional aspects of art and design. Rodchenko's photography was particularly innovative, as he experimented with angles, perspectives, and lighting to create dynamic and visually-striking images. He also designed posters and book covers, becoming one of the most important graphic designers of the early Soviet Union. Later in his career, he focused more on painting and sculpture, but remained committed to the principles of Constructivism throughout his life. His work had a significant influence on the development of modern art and design.</p><p>Rodchenko's early interest in art was supported by his family, and he pursued formal training at the Kazan Art School and later the Stroganov School of Applied Arts in Moscow. In the early years of his career, he was influenced by the ideas of the Russian avant-garde and developed an interest in photography. He became involved with the journal 'Lef' and exhibition group 'October', which were dedicated to promoting the principles of Constructivism.</p><p>Rodchenko's photography was characterized by its use of unusual angles and viewpoints, as well as its exploration of light and shadow. He often employed extreme close-ups and abstract compositions, creating images that were distinctively modern and were celebrated for their energy and dynamism. His work in graphic design was similarly innovative, as he experimented with typography and the use of color to create bold, eye-catching designs.</p><p>In the later years of his life, Rodchenko turned to painting and sculpture, experimenting with non-objective abstraction and geometric forms. He was also involved with the design of public spaces, creating innovative plans for parks, streets, and buildings. Despite his success, Rodchenko was subject to criticism and persecution under Stalin's regime and was forced to abandon many of his most radical ideas. Nonetheless, his legacy as a pioneering artist and designer continues to be celebrated today.</p><p></p><p>
