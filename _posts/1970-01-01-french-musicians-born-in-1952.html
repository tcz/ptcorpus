a French
musician.


						</p><p>He was best known for his work as a drummer and percussionist, having played with a number of prominent progressive rock bands such as Gong, Mike Oldfield, and Steve Hillage.

In addition to his musical career, Moerlen was also a skilled pilot and aircraft mechanic, and he served as a flight instructor in the French Air Force.</p><p>Throughout his career, Moerlen was known for his expert musicianship and his ability to blend different genres and styles of music. He was particularly recognized for his skill on the vibraphone and the marimba, which he incorporated into his performances with Gong and other bands. In the 1980s, Moerlen moved to the United States and continued to tour and record with his band, as well as collaborating with musicians such as Peter Banks and Bon Lozaga. He also contributed to film soundtracks and worked on several solo projects.

In addition to his musical legacy, Moerlen's dedication to both his passions, music and aviation, serve as a testament to his remarkable spirit and drive.</p><p>Moerlen's love for aviation extended beyond his career as a pilot and mechanic, as he also incorporated it into his music. One example is his composition "Winged Messenger" on the album "Expresso II" by Gong, which features airplane sound effects and a rhythm that mimics the sound of a propeller. Moerlen's ability to seamlessly merge his two passions is a testament to his creativity and versatility.</p><p>Throughout his career, Moerlen collaborated with a diverse range of artists spanning various genres. In addition to his work with progressive rock bands, he also worked with jazz musicians such as Didier Lockwood and Biréli Lagrène.
