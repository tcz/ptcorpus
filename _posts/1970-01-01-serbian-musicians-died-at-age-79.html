		a.k.a. Milutin Milankovic

	
was
a Serbian
scientist, mathematician and writer.


					</p><p>Milanković is best known for his theory of climate change which explains how the long-term cyclical changes in Earth's tilt and orbit affect the planet's climate. His theory, which he developed in the 1920s, has since been supported by extensive scientific research and is now widely accepted as a key driver of Earth's climate.</p><p>In addition to his work on climate change, Milanković made significant contributions to several other fields, including celestial mechanics and geophysics.

After completing his studies, he returned to Serbia and began his academic career, eventually becoming a professor at the University of Belgrade.</p><p>Milanković's interest in climate change was sparked by his study of the ice age, which he believed was caused by changes in Earth's orbit. He spent years studying the movement of Earth and its satellites, as well as the effects of solar radiation on the planet's climate. His calculations led him to develop a mathematical model that predicted the cyclical changes in the planet's climate over long periods of time.</p><p>Milanković also made important contributions to the fields of celestial mechanics and geophysics. He worked on the problem of the stability of the solar system and the mathematical analysis of planetary motion. He also studied the Earth's magnetic field and its relationship with the planet's interior structure.</p><p>In addition to his academic pursuits, Milanković was also an active writer and contributed to several newspapers and magazines.
