(June 23, 1894		White Lodge, London-May 28, 1972			Paris)

	
		also known as Duke of Windsor, King Edward VIII, Edward VIII, Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David Wettin, David, The Duke of Windsor or Edward, Duke of Windsor

	
was
a British
, .


					</p><p>monarch who reigned for less than a year from January to December 1936. He succeeded his father, King George V, but abdicated the throne in order to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American socialite, as the Church of England did not allow marriage to divorcees at the time. Edward's abdication crisis caused a constitutional crisis in the UK and led to his younger brother, George VI, ascending to the throne. After his abdication, Edward was given the title Duke of Windsor and lived the rest of his life as a private citizen. He and Wallis Simpson were married in 1937 and remained married until his death in 1972. Edward VIII was also known for his friendship with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime, leading to speculation and controversy surrounding his political views and possible sympathy towards fascism.</p><p>Edward VIII was born as the eldest son of King George V and Queen Mary in 1894. He grew up in a royal household with his five siblings and received a private education. Following his military service in World War I, he became known for his interest in fashion and arts.</p><p>In 1930, Edward embarked on a world tour of the British Empire, which helped to boost his popularity among the public. However, his relationship with Wallis Simpson, whom he met in 1931, soon became a source of controversy. Simpson was still in the process of divorcing her second husband at the time, and her relationship with Edward was frowned upon by both the Royal Family and the British government.</p><p>The abdication crisis that ensued following Edward's announcement of his intention to marry Simpson was one of the most significant events in British history. Many believed that Edward's decision to give up the throne was selfish and ill-advised. The crisis brought the constitutional role of the monarchy and the power of government into sharp focus.</p><p>After his abdication, Edward was appointed as Governor of the Bahamas, a position he held from 1940 to 1945. Following his return to the UK, he lived a life of relative seclusion with Simpson, whom he had married in France in 1937. Despite rumors of his pro-Nazi sympathies, there is little concrete evidence to suggest that Edward supported fascism or that he acted against Britain's national interests.</p><p>Edward died in Paris in 1972 and was buried alongside his parents, King George V and Queen Mary, at Windsor Castle. Despite his brief reign and controversial personal life, he remains one of the most intriguing figures in English history.</p><p></p><p>

Duras continued to write and publish until her death in 1996.</p><p>In addition to her prolific career as a writer and filmmaker, Marguerite Duras was also an active member of the French Resistance during World War II. Along with her husband, Robert Antelme, she participated in underground activities and was eventually arrested and sent to a concentration camp. Her experiences during this time influenced much of her later work, including her memoir "La Douleur" (The Pain) which recounts her time in the concentration camp.</p><p>Duras was also a political activist and aligned herself with left-wing politics. She was a member of the French Communist Party for a time but later distanced herself from the party due to ideological differences.</p><p>Despite her controversial political views, Duras remained a beloved and influential figure in French culture.
