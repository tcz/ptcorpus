W. de Klerk's efforts to end apartheid and move towards multi-racial democracy. He refused to participate in negotiations with the African National Congress and other opposition groups, arguing that they were a threat to white minority rule.</p><p>Despite his vehement opposition to change, Treurnicht gained a significant following among conservative Afrikaners who saw him as a defender of their traditional values and way of life. He was especially popular in rural areas of the country where support for apartheid and segregation was strongest.</p><p>Treurnicht's legacy remains controversial and divisive to this day. While some praise him for his defense of Afrikaner culture and identity, many others see him as a symbol of the racism and oppression that characterized apartheid-era South Africa.</p><p></p><p>
