						Hadda Brooks started playing piano at the age of six and went on to become popular for her boogie-woogie and blues style of music. She was one of the first African American women to have a crossover appeal to white audiences during the 1940s and the 1950s. Brooks' hit single "Swingin' the Boogie" and her role in 1948's film "One O'Clock Jump" solidified her place in music history. In addition to music, Brooks also worked in Hollywood, appearing in films such as "Out of the Blue" and "The Bad and the Beautiful". She continued performing throughout her life and was inducted into the Women's Hall of Fame in 2002.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=156308" title="Wikipedia article about Hadda Brooks">Hadda Brooks on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/slovak-musicians-died-at-age-80.html' title='Slovak musicians died at age 80'><strong>Slovak musicians died at age 80</strong> List of the top 4 Slovak music stars who died when they were 80</a></li><li><a href='/norwegian-musicians-died-at-age-52.html' title='Norwegian musicians died at age 52'><strong>Norwegian musicians died at age 52</strong> List of the top 5 Norwegian music stars who died when they were 52</a></li><li><a href='/indonesian-musicians-died-at-age-49.html' title='Indonesian musicians died at age 49'><strong>Indonesian musicians died at age 49</strong> List of the top 3 Indonesian music stars who died when they were 49</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/canadian-actresses-died-in-2005.html' title='Canadian actresses died in 2005'><strong>Canadian actresses died in 2005</strong> List of the top 4 Canadian actresses who died in 2005</a></li><li><a href='/american-actresses-died-at-age-38.html' title='American actresses died at age 38'><strong>American actresses died at age 38</strong> List of the top 8 American actresses who died when they were 38</a></li><li><a href='/austrian-actors-died-before-turning-30.html' title='Austrian actors died before turning 30'><strong>Austrian actors died before turning 30</strong> List of the top 1 Austrian actors who died before they turned 30</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
