						</p><p>Yates first gained attention in the 1980s as a music journalist and television presenter on shows such as The Tube and The Big Breakfast. She also had a successful career as a writer, penning two autobiographies and several children's books. In her personal life, Yates was known for her rocky relationships, including a high-profile romance and marriage with musician Bob Geldof, with whom she had three children. However, she left Geldof for INXS frontman Michael Hutchence and had a daughter with him before Hutchence's untimely death in 1997. Yates battled drug addiction throughout her life and tragically died of a heroin overdose in 2000 at the age of 41.</p><p>Yates was the fourth of five children and her father, Jess Yates, was a television presenter and producer. Her parents divorced when she was just five years old and her mother moved the family to north Wales. Yates left home at the young age of 16 and moved to London, where she began her career as a journalist. She worked for various publications including Record Mirror and New Musical Express.</p><p>In addition to her work in television and writing, Yates was also involved in charity work. She supported various causes such as breast cancer awareness and children's charities. She even auctioned off her own clothes to raise money for charity.</p><p>Yates' death was a shock to many, as she was still relatively young and had children to care for. Her passing brought attention to the dangers of drug addiction and inspired others to seek help for their own addictions. Despite her personal struggles, Yates is remembered as a talented and charismatic television personality and writer.</p><p>Yates' career in the media industry started in the late 1970s when she became a trainee at Jackie magazine. She then became a regular contributor to other publications such as The Face and i-D. In the early 1980s, she was hired as a researcher for the music show The Tube, which led to her becoming a co-presenter on the show. Her presenting style was often described as quirky and unique, making her a firm favorite with viewers.</p><p>In 1995, Yates faced a public scandal after photographs of her and Michael Hutchence were published in a tabloid newspaper. The pictures showed the couple in a compromising position on a yacht, which led to a media storm and caused a rift between Yates and Bob Geldof. Despite this, Yates continued her relationship with Hutchence until his death two years later.</p><p>Following Hutchence's death, Yates struggled with depression and addiction, and her relationship with her children became strained. In the months leading up to her death, she appeared increasingly frail and disheveled in public appearances.</p><p>Yates' legacy lives on through her children, who have gone on to have successful careers in their own right. Peaches Geldof, tragically passed away in 2014 at the age of 25, but her sisters Fifi Trixibelle Geldof and Pixie Geldof, are both successful models and singers. Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof has also pursued a career in music. Yates will always be remembered as a beloved and talented figure in the entertainment industry, whose work left a lasting impact on British culture.</p><p></p><p>
