						</p><p>Gert Fröbe is best known for his iconic role as Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond film "Goldfinger" in 1964. However, he had many successful roles both in German and English-speaking films throughout his career. He starred in several German films during the 1950s and 1960s, including "Die Brücke" (The Bridge), for which he won the Best Actor award at the 1959 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. </p><p>Fröbe also appeared in international productions, such as "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" in 1968 and "Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines" in 1965. In addition to his acting career, Fröbe was also a successful violinist and performed concerts throughout Germany. He was also a voice actor and his voice can be heard in the German dubs of several Disney films, including "The Sword in the Stone" and "101 Dalmatians". </p><p>Fröbe was known for his wit, humor, and love of practical jokes on set. He was passionate about his work and made a lasting impact on the film industry, particularly in the genre of spy films. Despite his success, Fröbe remained humble and dedicated to his craft until his death in 1988.</p><p>Fröbe was born in Zwickau, Germany and started his acting career in the 1940s in German theater productions. He soon transitioned to film and became one of the most popular German actors of the 1950s and 1960s. Fröbe was fluent in both German and English, which allowed him to work on international productions. However, he always remained committed to promoting and maintaining German culture in his work.</p><p>One of Fröbe's most challenging roles was playing a Nazi officer in the film "The Longest Day" in 1962. Fröbe initially refused the role as he was vehemently opposed to the Nazi regime and its atrocities. He only accepted the role after learning that the character he was to play was actually anti-Nazi.</p><p>Fröbe's career was not without controversies. In the 1950s, he was briefly accused of being a member of the Nazi Party during World War II. However, Fröbe vehemently denied the accusation and it was soon discovered to be false. Fröbe also faced criticism for his portrayal of the character of Goldfinger as a Jewish stereotype, which he strongly denied.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Fröbe remains one of the most iconic actors in film history. He inspired numerous actors and filmmakers, including famed German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who cited Fröbe as one of his biggest influences. Fröbe's legacy as a versatile and talented actor continues to inspire new generations of performers.</p><p>In addition to his many talents, Gert Fröbe was also a screenwriter. He wrote the script for the 1960 film "The Two-Headed Spy," which he also starred in. Fröbe was known for his dedication to his craft and for his intense preparation for each role he took on. He often visited the locations in which films were set to immerse himself in the character and the environment. His commitment and hard work paid off with critical and commercial success throughout his career. Gert Fröbe was honored with several awards for his contributions to the film industry, including the Bambi Award for Best Actor in 1961 and the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1965. He was truly a legend in his time and his impact on the film industry will never be forgotten.</p><p></p><p>
