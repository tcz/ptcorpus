		also known as Timo Mukka

	
was
a Finnish
writer.


					
			
		He had
		two
		children,
		Johan Mukka and Tuuli Mukka.

						</p><p>Timo K. Mukka was mainly known for his works which often depicted the lives of the marginalized people in Finnish Lapland. His works were largely autobiographical in nature and drew heavily on his own experiences of living in the region. Despite his short life and career, Mukka's writing has had a lasting impact on Finnish literature, and he is widely regarded as a key figure of the 20th century Finnish literary scene. Some of his notable works include "Maa on syntinen laulu" (The Earth is a Sinful Song) and "Kun on oikein pieni" (When You're Very Small). Mukka's life and work were the subject of a biographical film titled "Timo K. Mukka - The Man from the Arctic Circle" which was released in 2017.</p><p>Mukka was born to a family of reindeer herders in the small village of Kierinki in northern Finland. As a child, he attended a boarding school run by the Swedish-speaking population of Finland, an experience which he found both traumatic and inspiring, as it helped to ignite his passion for writing. Mukka began his career as a writer in the 1960s, publishing several short stories and poems before finishing his debut novel "Maa on syntinen laulu" in 1970. The novel was an instant success and is now considered a classic of Finnish literature. Unfortunately, Mukka's promising career was cut short by his untimely death in 1973 at the age of 28. However, his legacy lives on through the influence he had on subsequent generations of Finnish writers who have continued to explore the themes of identity, marginalization, and the natural environment that Mukka so often wrote about.</p><p>Despite his short life, Timo K. Mukka left an indelible mark on Finnish literature. His works have been translated into several languages and continue to be celebrated. His writing style was characterized by vivid descriptions of the natural world, his characters' struggles against social and economic oppression, and his own experiences growing up as a member of a minority community in Finland. In the years following his death, Mukka has been posthumously awarded numerous honors, including the Eino Leino Prize and the Kalevi Jäntti Prize. He is remembered as a talented writer who captured the essence of Finnish Lapland and the people who call it home.</p><p>Mukka's impact on Finnish literature is not limited to his own works. In 1973, he co-founded the literary magazine Pohjoinen, which focused on publishing regional and indigenous literature from Lapland. Through this magazine, Mukka mentored and encouraged many young writers, helping to foster a new generation of voices from the region. Pohjoinen continued to publish until 2012, having become an important platform for regional literature.</p><p>The legacy of Timo K. Mukka has also extended beyond literature. In 2016, a new literary award, the Timo K. Mukka Prize, was established to recognize writers who explore social issues and marginalized voices, in the spirit of Mukka's work. The prize ceremony is held annually in Mukka's hometown of Kierinki, and has become an important event in the Finnish literary calendar.</p><p>In addition to the biographical film about Mukka, his life and work have also been the subject of academic study. Scholars have praised his unique voice and his ability to capture the experiences of a minority culture within Finland. Mukka's writing has been compared to that of other famous Finnish authors, such as Tove Jansson and Pentti Saarikoski, and his contributions to Finnish literature have been recognized by the Finnish government, which in 2003 designated him a "national author."</p><p>Timo K. Mukka's writing continues to be read and appreciated by literary enthusiasts and scholars around the world. His legacy lives on as an example of the power of literature to illuminate the struggles and triumphs of marginalized communities.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in heart failure.

(April 10, 1888		Utsjoki-August 8, 1916			Inari, Finland)


was
a Finnish
writer.


					</p><p>He was born in Utsjoki, Finland, which is located in the northernmost part of the country. Jalvi was part of the indigenous Sami community and was a rare example of a published Sami author in the early 20th century.</p><p>Jalvi's writing drew inspiration from his Sami heritage and often explored themes related to Sami culture and history. He is best known for his book "Jäämeren Kultaa" (Gold of the Arctic Ocean), which was published in 1915 and tells the story of a Sami man who searches for gold in the Arctic Ocean.</p><p>Despite his relatively short life, Jalvi remains an important figure in Sami literature and is recognized for his contributions to the preservation and celebration of Sami culture.</p><p>In addition to his literary writings, Jalvi was also known for his political activism, advocating for the rights and recognition of the Sami people. He was a member of the Finnish Agrarian League, which was a political party that supported agricultural and rural interests, and he used his platform to raise awareness about Sami issues. Jalvi's activism and literary works helped to pave the way for future Sami writers and activists. Today, he is remembered as a pioneer of Sami literature and an important cultural figure in Finland.</p><p>Throughout his life, Pedar Jalvi faced many obstacles due to his Sami heritage. He grew up in a community that faced discrimination and oppression, and he experienced firsthand the effects of assimilation policies implemented by both Finland and Norway. However, Jalvi was determined to preserve Sami culture and heritage through his writing and activism.</p><p>Aside from his literary work and political advocacy, Jalvi was also known for his linguistic contributions to the Sami community. He was one of the first Sami scholars to study the Sami language and record its grammar and vocabulary. His research paved the way for future Sami linguists and helped to ensure the survival of the Sami language.</p><p>Sadly, Jalvi's life was cut short when he died at the young age of 28 from tuberculosis. However, his legacy continues to inspire and motivate the Sami community to this day. In recognition of his contributions to Sami literature and culture, there is a statue of Jalvi in Inari, Finland, where he spent the last years of his life.</p><p>Jalvi was also known for his travels and expeditions to remote areas of the Arctic, where he would study the Sami way of life and collect traditional stories and songs. He believed that it was important to document and preserve Sami cultural practices before they were lost to assimilation and modernization. Jalvi's expeditions not only contributed to his literary work but also helped to spread awareness about Sami culture to a wider audience.In addition to "Jäämeren Kultaa," Jalvi also published a collection of Sami folk tales and a book of Sami poems. His literary style was characterized by a deep respect and appreciation for Sami culture and a desire to preserve and celebrate it.Beyond his legacy in literature and cultural preservation, Jalvi's activism helped to bring attention to broader issues facing the Sami community. He advocated for greater political representation, the right to use traditional lands, and recognition of the Sami people as distinct and unique. His work helped to lay the foundation for the modern Sami rights movement, which has made significant progress in recent decades towards achieving greater autonomy and recognition.</p><p></p><p>
