(January 15, 1914		Middelburg-November 30, 1943			Auschwitz concentration camp)


was
a Dutch
writer.


					</p><p>Etty Hillesum is best known for her diaries, which were published after her death as "An Interrupted Life: The Diaries, 1941-1943 and Letters from Westerbork." In her diaries, she reflects on her spiritual journey and ideas about love, God, and the human experience. Despite facing persecution and discrimination as a Jewish woman in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam, she refused to succumb to hatred and instead focused on cultivating inner peace and compassion. Her work has been praised for its courage and humanity, and she is often remembered as a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of adversity.</p><p>Etty Hillesum was born to a Jewish family in the Netherlands and grew up in a privileged environment. She received a classical education and attended the University of Amsterdam, where she studied law and Slavic languages. Despite her academic pursuits, she struggled with anxiety and depression throughout her life and turned to psychoanalysis and Eastern spirituality for solace.</p><p>When the Nazis invaded the Netherlands in 1940, Hillesum and her family were forced to confront the reality of discrimination and persecution. She began writing her diary as a way to cope with her emotions and document her experiences, which ranged from working as a social worker for Jewish refugees to hiding in a series of safe houses to avoid detection.</p><p>Despite the horrors she witnessed, Hillesum never lost faith in humanity or in God. She believed that by cultivating inner peace and compassion, she could transcend the limitations of her circumstances and connect with a higher power. Her diary entries are marked by a poetic, introspective style that explores themes of love, sacrifice, and transcendence.</p><p>In 1943, Hillesum was arrested and sent to the Westerbork transit camp, where she continued to write and to care for her fellow inmates. She was eventually transported to Auschwitz, where she died at the age of 29. After the war, her diaries were discovered and published, and she became a posthumous literary sensation. Today, she is remembered as a brave and compassionate woman who used her writing to bear witness to the atrocities of the Holocaust and to inspire others to strive for inner peace and hope in the face of adversity.</p><p>Etty Hillesum's legacy has continued to inspire generations of readers and writers. Her diaries have been translated into several languages and her writing has been widely studied by scholars interested in exploring the intersections of spirituality, psychology, and social justice. Hillesum's work has also been used by activists and educators as a way to promote peace and tolerance in the world. In 2008, the Dutch parliament declared November 30 to be "Etty Hillesum Day" in honor of her contributions to Dutch literature and her unwavering commitment to human dignity and compassion. Despite her tragic death, Hillesum's spirit lives on as a beacon of hope and resilience for all those who seek to make the world a better place.</p><p></p><p>

Today, his works can be found in many prestigious collections, including those of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the Louvre in Paris.</p><p>Jan van Mieris was a prolific artist who created around 90 paintings in a short career that lasted less than a decade. Many of his paintings were commissioned by wealthy Dutch patrons, who appreciated his attention to detail and skillful use of light and color.Jan van Mieris' work was also known for its psychological depth and sensitivity. He was particularly skilled at capturing the complex emotions of his subjects, such as the pensive expression of a woman lost in thought or the mischievous grin of a child staring into the viewer's eyes. His paintings were often set in domestic environments, which added to the intimate and personal feeling of his work.In addition to Carlo Maratta, Jan van Mieris was also influenced by the work of other Italian Baroque painters such as Guido Reni and Federico Barocci. He was particularly impressed by the use of chiaroscuro in their work, which he adapted to his own style to create a sense of depth and luminosity in his paintings.Jan van Mieris' legacy continues to live on today as his work is valued not only for its beauty and technical proficiency but also for its contribution to the development of Dutch genre painting during the 17th century.</p><p></p><p>
