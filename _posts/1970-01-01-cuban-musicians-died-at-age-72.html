									</h1><p>Here are 2 famous musicians from Cuba died at 72:</p><h2>Fulgencio Batista</h2><p><strong>Fulgencio Batista</strong>
(January 16, 1901		Banes, Cuba-August 6, 1973			Guadalmina)


was
a Cuban
politician.


					
			
		He had
		eight
		children,
		Elisa Aleida Batista y Godinez, Mirta Caridad Batista y Godinez, Fulgencio Rubén Batista Godínez, Jorge Luis Batista Fernández, Carlos Manuel Batista Fernández, Fulgencio José Batista Fernández, Marta María Batista Fernández and Fermina Lázara Batista Estévez.

						</p><p>Fulgencio Batista first rose to power in 1933 when he led a military coup against the elected government. He then ruled as a dictator until he was overthrown by Fidel Castro's revolution in 1959. During his rule, Batista reinforced ties with the US, enabling increased US investment and tourism in Cuba. However, his regime was also marked by corruption, violence, and suppression of political opposition. After his overthrow, Batista fled to Spain where he lived in exile until his death.</p><p>As a young man, Fulgencio Batista served in the Cuban army and rose to the rank of sergeant. He became involved in politics in the 1920s, and was elected to the Cuban House of Representatives in 1932. However, he soon became dissatisfied with the democratic process and turned to military force to gain power. After his initial rule as president, Batista came back to power in 1952, when he led a military coup against the elected government of Carlos Prio Socarras. He abolished the constitution and established a dictatorship. </p><p>During his second tenure, he attempted to modernize the country's infrastructure, attracting foreign investment and boosting the economy. However, his regime became increasingly dictatorial and repressive, with extensive censorship and violence against political opponents. Many Cubans, including Fidel Castro, viewed Batista as a puppet of the United States, and resented the extensive influence of American corporations on Cuba's economy. In the face of a communist uprising led by Castro, Batista fled the country on January 1, 1959. </p><p>After his exile in Spain, Batista mostly kept a low profile, making occasional appearances on Spanish television, and rarely speaking to the press. His death in Marbella, Spain in 1973, provoked very little reaction in Cuba, where he remained a hated figure.</p><p></p><p>
						He died in myocardial infarction.
