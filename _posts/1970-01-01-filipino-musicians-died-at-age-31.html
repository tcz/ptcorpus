(March 3, 1975		Isabela, Basilan-September 4, 2006			Patikul, Sulu)


was
a Filipino
personality.


					</p><p>He was the co-founder and leader of the Abu Sayyaf Group, a militant Islamist organization based in the southern Philippines. Janjalani was known for his extremist views and involvement in numerous terrorist attacks, which led to a U.S. bounty of $5 million on his head. He was killed in an encounter with Philippine security forces in 2006. Janjalani's legacy and influence continue to be felt in the ongoing conflicts in the region.</p><p>Born into a Muslim family, Khadaffy Janjalani grew up in poverty and was reportedly radicalized during his time as a student in Saudi Arabia. In 1991, he founded the Abu Sayyaf Group, which initially espoused separatist goals but later became known for its brutal tactics and for pledging allegiance to Al-Qaeda. The group carried out numerous bombings, kidnappings, and killings in the Philippines, targeting both civilians and government officials. </p><p>Janjalani himself was implicated in the 2004 bombing of a ferry that killed more than 100 people, as well as the abduction of several foreign tourists, including Americans. Despite his notoriety as a terrorist leader, some reports suggest that he was a charismatic figure who was respected by some members of his community for his efforts to provide aid and protection to fellow Muslims. </p><p>The circumstances of Janjalani's death in a clash with Philippine military forces continue to be disputed. Some sources claim that he died in a jungle ambush, while others suggest that he was captured alive and then executed by the military. Regardless of the details, his death was seen as a significant blow to the Abu Sayyaf Group, which has continued to engage in violent activities in the years since.</p><p></p><p>
