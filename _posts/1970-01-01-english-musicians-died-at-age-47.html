was
an English
actor.


					</p><p>She was regarded as one of the most celebrated actresses of her time, particularly for her performances in tragic roles. Oldfield began her career working in small theatre troupes before making her debut in London's Drury Lane Theatre in 1707. Her talent and stage presence soon caught the attention of audiences and critics alike, and she became a popular figure in London's theatre scene in the early 18th century. In addition to her acting abilities, Oldfield was also known for her beauty and was said to have had numerous admirers throughout her career. Despite her success on stage, Oldfield was known for her modesty and philanthropy, supporting numerous charitable causes throughout her life. She retired from the stage in 1730 due to illness and died later that same year at the age of 47.</p><p>In addition to her work on stage, Anne Oldfield was also known for her literary and artistic endeavors. She was a friend of several notable writers of the time, including Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift, and was known to have contributed to their works. Oldfield was also a talented painter and often gave her painted portraits as gifts to friends and family. Furthermore, throughout her career, Oldfield was noted for her dedication to improving the status of women in the performing arts. She was one of the first actresses to demand and receive equal pay for her work, paving the way for future generations of female performers. Her legacy is remembered through the Anne Oldfield theatre in Covent Garden, London, which is named in her honor.</p><p>Oldfield was born Anne Rogers, but she changed her last name to Oldfield after the man who raised her. Her father died when she was young, and her mother remarried a man named William Farquhar, who happened to be an actor. It was Farquhar who introduced Oldfield to the world of theatre and encouraged her to pursue a career in acting. </p><p>Oldfield was known for her ability to convey complex emotions on stage and was particularly beloved for her performances in tragic roles. She was also known for her impeccable diction and clear delivery on stage, both of which were highly valued in the theatre of her time. </p><p>Despite her success and popularity, Oldfield was not without her critics. Some condemned her for playing "immoral" characters, and others took issue with her offstage behavior, which they saw as frivolous and lacking in decorum. Oldfield herself was a deeply religious person and once turned down a role that required her to swear on stage because she found it offensive. </p><p>In addition to her philanthropy and advocacy for women in the performing arts, Oldfield was also known for her wit and sense of humor. She once quipped to a friend who praised her performance on stage, "Oh yes, I was right last night: I was just bad enough to please." </p><p>Oldfield's influence on the London theatre scene of the early 18th century cannot be overstated. She paved the way for other female performers to gain greater respect and recognition in the industry and helped establish the theatre as a legitimate art form in the eyes of the public.</p><p></p><p>
