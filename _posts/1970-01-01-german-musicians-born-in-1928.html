He was born on July 19, 1928 in Königsberg and is of Jewish origin. During World War II, he was sent along with his mother to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. After they were liberated in 1945, Wieck and his mother moved to the Soviet occupation zone in Germany where they lived in poverty. He studied music in Weimar and later became a concert pianist. In addition to his memoir, Wieck has also written several novels and short stories.</p><p>Wieck's initial success as a concert pianist was ultimately halted by a hand injury, forcing him to abandon his musical career.
