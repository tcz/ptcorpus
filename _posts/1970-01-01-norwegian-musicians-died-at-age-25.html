(May 6, 1919		Trondheim-January 11, 1945			Budal)


was
a Norwegian
personality.


					</p><p>He was an active member of the Norwegian resistance during World War II, involved in sabotage and intelligence operations against the occupying German forces. In 1944, he was arrested by German authorities and sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. He died there on January 11, 1945, just a few months before the end of the war. Hansen is remembered as a brave and dedicated fighter for his country's freedom and was posthumously awarded the War Cross with Sword in 1947.</p><p>Hansen was born in Trondheim, Norway, on May 6, 1919, to a middle-class family. He grew up in a family of six siblings and was the second oldest among them. As a young man, he took an interest in politics and became involved in left-wing movements. When Germany invaded Norway in 1940, he joined the resistance movement and became an active member of Milorg, the Norwegian resistance group.</p><p>Hansen quickly gained a reputation for his intelligence and bravery. He participated in several sabotage operations against the Germans, including blowing up bridges and disrupting supply lines. He also acted as a courier, delivering messages and information between different cells of the resistance movement.</p><p>In August 1944, Hansen was arrested by the Gestapo and taken to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany. He was subjected to brutal treatment and forced to endure harsh living conditions. Nevertheless, he remained defiant and refused to provide any information to his captors.</p><p>Tragically, Hansen's time in the concentration camp proved to be short-lived. He succumbed to a severe case of pneumonia on January 11, 1945, just a few months before the end of the war.</p><p>Hansen's legacy as a hero of the Norwegian resistance is still celebrated today. He was posthumously awarded the War Cross with Sword, one of Norway's highest honors, in 1947. His bravery and sacrifice continue to be an inspiration to people around the world.</p><p>In addition to his acts of resistance and bravery, Nils Uhlin Hansen was also a talented musician. He was a skilled jazz pianist and often played in local bars and clubs before the war. Hansen's love for music and his dedication to the resistance movement were intertwined, as he used his performances as opportunities to gather intelligence and spread anti-German propaganda. </p><p>Hansen's family also played a role in the resistance movement. His younger sister, Ingerid, was a member of the Norwegian Communist Party and worked as a courier for the resistance. After the war, she became a prominent politician, serving in the Norwegian parliament from 1954 to 1969.</p><p>Today, Hansen is remembered as a symbol of Norwegian resistance against the Nazi occupation. His story has been told in books and documentaries, and several memorials have been established in his honor, including a street named after him in Trondheim. His name is also inscribed on the Resistance Monument in Fannrem, Norway, along with other heroes of the resistance movement.</p><p></p><p>
