He was an advocate for women's rights and worked to promote education and economic opportunities for women. He also supported the rights of Indigenous peoples in Argentina, recognizing the importance of their cultural heritage and the need for greater understanding and reconciliation.</p><p>Today, José Hernández is remembered as a trailblazer in Argentine literature, politics, and social justice.
