(August 1, 1865		Messina-January 8, 1911			Portoferraio)


was
an Italian
lawyer, writer and journalist.


					</p><p>He was also a prominent socialist and labor activist during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Italy. Gori was involved in various socialist organizations and newspapers, advocating for workers' rights and labor reforms. He also wrote political and social commentary, and his poems often addressed themes of love, justice, and the struggle against oppression. In addition to his activism and writing, Gori was also involved in legal work and defended several prominent socialist figures in court. Despite his contributions, Gori's legacy was largely overshadowed by his untimely death at the age of 45. He remains a significant figure in Italian socialist and labor history.</p><p>In 1898, Pietro Gori helped lead a general strike in Tuscany, which was met with violent repression by the government. He was arrested and spent two years in prison before being released due to public pressure. After his release, Gori continued his activism, founding a socialist newspaper and participating in protests and demonstrations. He was elected to the Italian Parliament in 1900 and worked to pass legislation that would improve working conditions and protect workers' rights. Gori also wrote plays and worked as a theater critic, using drama as a tool to promote socialist ideas. He is remembered today as a champion of the working class and a passionate advocate for social justice.</p><p>In 1901, Gori founded the Italian Socialist Party's newspaper "Avanti!", which quickly became a leading socialist publication in Italy. He used the paper to promote socialist ideals and criticize government policies, and it played a crucial role in the growth of the socialist movement in Italy. Gori's commitment to the cause of workers' rights and his tireless activism made him a beloved figure among Italian socialists, and he was hailed as a hero by many. However, his activism also made him a target of government repression, and he was often arrested and jailed for his political activities. Despite facing many challenges and setbacks, Gori remained committed to the struggle for social justice until his death in 1911. His legacy continues to inspire generations of activists and socialists in Italy and around the world.</p><p></p><p>

(March 28, 1472		Florence-October 6, 1517)

	
		also known as Baccio della Porta

	
was
an Italian
personality.


					</p><p>Fra Bartolomeo was a Renaissance painter who was known for his religious paintings and frescoes. He was a member of the Dominican Order and was heavily influenced by the teachings of Savonarola, a Dominican friar who preached against the excess and corruption of the Church. Fra Bartolomeo's paintings often reflected this spiritual and moral vision, depicting scenes from the Bible and the lives of the saints with a powerful sense of gravity and piety. He worked in Florence and San Marco, where he was a close associate of the famous artist and monk, Fra Angelico. Fra Bartolomeo's art had a significant impact on the development of Italian Renaissance art, and he remains an important figure in the history of Western art.</p><p>Fra Bartolomeo's real name was Bartolomeo di Pagholo del Fattorino. At the age of 12, he became a Dominican friar and went to the Dominican friary at San Marco in Florence to study. There, he met and was influenced by the works of Fra Angelico. Fra Bartolomeo later became a fellow friar of Fra Angelico at San Marco, where the two collaborated on a number of artworks. He began his career as an artist by painting portraits, but after seeing the works of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, he shifted to religious paintings. One of his most famous works is the Deposition, which is now at the Pitti Palace in Florence. Fra Bartolomeo's abilities as an artist were also recorded by his contemporary, Giorgio Vasari, in The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.</p><p>In addition to his work as a painter, Fra Bartolomeo was also known for his skill as a draftsman and printmaker. He was one of the first artists in Italy to experiment with the technique of chiaroscuro, the use of light and shadow to create a sense of depth and volume in a two-dimensional image. Fra Bartolomeo's interest in this technique is evident in many of his works, including his large altarpieces and frescoes.</p><p>Despite his success as an artist, Fra Bartolomeo struggled with personal demons throughout his life. He suffered from a chronic illness that often left him weak and exhausted, and he struggled with bouts of depression and anxiety. In 1516, he decided to give up painting and return to the Dominican Order to focus on his spiritual well-being. He died just a year later, at the age of 45.</p><p>Today, Fra Bartolomeo is remembered as one of the great artistic innovators of the Italian Renaissance. His works continue to inspire and influence artists around the world, and his legacy as a spiritual leader and moral visionary is still felt in many communities today.</p><p></p><p>

He painted many prominent Florentine citizens, including the Medici family. His portrait of Giovanna degli Albizzi Tornabuoni, one of the most educated women of her time, is considered one of his masterpieces.</p><p>Ghirlandaio died at the age of 45 from an unknown cause, leaving behind a legacy of masterful art and a workshop that produced many illustrious artists.</p><p>In addition to his successful career as an artist, Ghirlandaio was also known for his involvement in Florentine politics. He served as a member of the Florentine government and was a supporter of the Medici family, who were powerful patrons of the arts in Renaissance Florence. Ghirlandaio's connections to the Medici helped him secure many of his major commissions, including the frescoes in the Sassetti Chapel.</p><p>As a teacher, Ghirlandaio was known for his rigorous training and attention to detail. His workshop was one of the most prestigious in Florence, and many of his pupils went on to become successful artists in their own right. One of his most famous pupils was Michelangelo, who learned the art of fresco painting in Ghirlandaio's workshop.</p><p>Today, Ghirlandaio's works can be found in museums and churches throughout Italy and around the world. His frescoes in the Tornabuoni Chapel and the Sassetti Chapel are still considered some of the finest examples of Renaissance art, and his portrait of Giovanna degli Albizzi Tornabuoni remains one of the most celebrated works of the period.

Throughout his life, Grimaldi remained deeply committed to his religious faith, and saw no conflict between his scientific work and his religious beliefs.</p><p>In addition to his work on light and hydrodynamics, Grimaldi also made important contributions to the study of magnetism and magnetization. He invented a method for magnetizing iron, which involved heating it to a high temperature and then cooling it in the presence of a magnet. This work laid the groundwork for later studies on the magnetic properties of materials.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Grimaldi's work was not widely recognized during his lifetime. It was only in the centuries after his death that his contributions to science began to be fully appreciated. Today, he is remembered as a pioneering scientist who helped to lay the foundations of modern physics and mathematics.</p><p>Grimaldi's legacy also includes the Grimaldi projection, which is a map projection that he developed in 1660. This projection is still used today and is particularly useful for showing continents that extend across both sides of the map.</p><p>Grimaldi was also an accomplished linguist, and spoke and wrote in multiple languages including Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac. He was known for his ability to translate scientific works from one language to another, which allowed scientists from different countries to share their findings.</p><p>In addition to his scientific and linguistic pursuits, Grimaldi was also an accomplished artist. He had a talent for drawing and painting, and often used his skills to illustrate his scientific works. His drawings of the diffraction patterns of light are particularly well-known and have been reproduced in many textbooks.</p><p>Throughout his life, Grimaldi remained committed to the Jesuit order and to his faith. He was known for his humility and his generosity, and spent much of his time ministering to the sick and the poor. Despite his many accomplishments, Grimaldi never sought fame or recognition, and was content to live a simple life devoted to science and to his religious beliefs.</p><p></p><p>
