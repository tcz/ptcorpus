					</p><p>Katy French started her modeling career in Dublin, where she moved at the age of 18. She quickly became one of the most recognizable faces on the Irish modeling scene and was featured in a number of high-profile campaigns for both Irish and international brands. In addition to her work as a model, French had a keen interest in charity work, and was involved in a number of different causes over the years. Her death in 2007 was a shocking loss for the Irish modeling industry, and prompted widespread discussion of drug use and addiction issues in the country.</p><p>After her death, it was discovered that Katy French had struggled with drug addiction for a number of years. In the wake of her passing, her family set up the Katy French Foundation to raise awareness of drug addiction and support those affected by it. The charity has since raised thousands of euros for numerous drug addiction support groups across Ireland. Additionally, a book was published in 2013 titled "Katy" which chronicled her life and tragic death. Despite her short life, Katy French's legacy has lived on through the charitable work done in her name, as well as the enduring impact she had on the Irish fashion industry.</p><p></p><p>
