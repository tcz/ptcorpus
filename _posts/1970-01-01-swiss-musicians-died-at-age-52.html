(December 12, 1866		Mulhouse-November 15, 1919			Zürich)


was
a Swiss
chemist.


					</p><p>He is known for his work on coordination complexes, which are compounds of a metal ion bonded to multiple ligands. Werner was the first to propose the concept of stereochemistry in coordination complexes, which refers to the arrangement of atoms in three-dimensional space. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1913 for his pioneering work on complex compounds. Werner also played a significant role in the development of inorganic chemistry, and his work provided a foundation for the understanding of many important reactions and processes in chemistry. He spent most of his career as a professor of chemistry at the University of Zurich.</p><p>Werner was born into a Jewish family in Mulhouse, which was then a part of the German Empire. He obtained his PhD from the University of Zurich in 1890, and subsequently worked as a lecturer and later as a professor at the university. Werner's investigations into the behavior of metal ions in solution led him to propose the concept of coordination compounds, which laid the groundwork for the modern field of coordination chemistry. He discovered that some metal ions can form complex compounds with specific ligands or molecules, and that the number and arrangement of these ligands can affect the properties and behavior of the compound.</p><p>Werner's pioneering work in the field of stereochemistry was a major contribution to the development of modern chemistry. He discovered that some coordination compounds can exist in different isomeric forms, which have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms in space. This discovery helped shape our understanding of molecular structure and chemical reactivity.</p><p>Werner continued to work and teach at the University of Zurich until his death in 1919. His legacy has continued to influence the field of inorganic chemistry and inspire new generations of chemists. In recognition of his contributions, the Alfred Werner Medal was established in 1983 to recognize outstanding research in coordination chemistry.</p><p>Werner was also an active and engaged member of the scientific community. He was a founding member of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and served as the president of the Swiss Chemical Society. Werner's work also had practical applications, such as in the development of new processes for dye production and in the purification of metals.</p><p>Despite his many accomplishments, Werner faced some challenges during his career. As a Jewish scientist in Europe during the early 20th century, he experienced discrimination and had limited career opportunities. He also faced criticism and hostility from some of his colleagues who were resistant to his ideas about stereochemistry.</p><p>Today, Werner is remembered as a pioneer in the field of coordination chemistry and as a trailblazer who helped pave the way for future generations of chemists. His contributions helped shape our understanding of molecular structure and chemical reactivity and continue to inspire new advancements in the field of chemistry.</p><p>In addition to his scientific contributions, Werner was also known for his personal life. He was married to Emma Giesker, who he met while studying in Zurich, and they had three children together. Werner was an avid mountain climber and nature enthusiast, and spent much of his free time exploring the Swiss Alps. He also had a passion for music and played the piano and violin.</p><p>Despite his premature death at the age of 52, Werner's impact on the world of chemistry is still felt today. His ideas about coordination chemistry and stereochemistry continue to influence research in fields such as biochemistry and materials science. The Alfred Werner Medal, which is awarded biennially by the Swiss Chemical Society, serves as a reminder of his lasting legacy and contributions to the scientific community.</p><p>Werner was not only a distinguished chemist, but he was also a prolific writer, having authored over 100 scientific papers during his lifetime. His writings were widely recognized for their clarity and originality, and he was known for his ability to explain complex ideas in a simple and accessible manner. Werner also had a keen interest in the history of science and wrote several articles on the subject, including a biographical sketch of the great French chemist Antoine Lavoisier.</p><p>Despite his success, Werner remained humble and dedicated to the pursuit of scientific knowledge throughout his life. He was known for his kindness and generosity, and he mentored many young chemists during his career. Werner's legacy continues to inspire generations of chemists around the world, and his contributions to the field of chemistry will undoubtedly be remembered for many years to come.</p><p></p><p>
