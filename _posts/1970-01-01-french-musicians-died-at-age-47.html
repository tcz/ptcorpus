					</p><p>He was a prominent abstract painter associated with the Art Informel movement. Atlan was born into a Sephardic Jewish family in Algeria and moved to Paris in 1930 to study medicine. However, he decided to pursue his passion for art and began to study painting at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. During World War II, he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp, but he miraculously survived and was liberated by Allied forces in 1945. </p><p>Atlan's work was strongly influenced by his Jewish heritage and North African roots, as well as by the Surrealist and Abstract Expressionist movements. He developed a unique style characterized by bold, colorful forms and dynamic brushstrokes that often incorporated calligraphic elements. Atlan was part of a group of artists who sought to break away from traditional forms and techniques in painting, and he played an important role in shaping the direction of postwar European abstract art. </p><p>Despite his relatively short career, Atlan had numerous exhibitions in France and internationally, and his works can be found in the collections of major museums around the world, including the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Tate Modern in London. He died at the age of 47 from injuries sustained in a car accident.</p><p></p><p>
