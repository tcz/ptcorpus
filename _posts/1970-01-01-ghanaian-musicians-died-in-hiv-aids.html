						Kiki Gyan was not only a musician but also a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and producer. He was born in Takoradi, Ghana, and showed an early interest in music, teaching himself how to play the piano at a young age. He was a child prodigy and by the time he was 15, he was a member of the popular Ghanaian band, Osibisa. </p><p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gyan emerged as a solo artist with a series of successful albums that fused funk and disco with traditional African rhythms. His music became very popular in Ghana and across Africa and he was often referred to as the "African superstar". He was also a highly sought after session musician and played with many musicians including Fela Kuti and Stevie Wonder.</p><p>However, Gyan struggled with drug addiction throughout his career, and his addiction eventually led to his downfall. He died tragically in June 2004 at the young age of 47 due to complications from long-term cocaine use. Despite his short life and troubled career, Kiki Gyan remains an important figure in the history of Ghanaian and African music, and his legacy continues to inspire musicians today.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=727819" title="Wikipedia article about Kiki Gyan">Kiki Gyan on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Related articles</h2><!--RELATED --><ul class='related'><li><a href='/norwegian-musicians-died-at-age-62.html' title='Norwegian musicians died at age 62'><strong>Norwegian musicians died at age 62</strong> List of the top 13 Norwegian music stars who died when they were 62</a></li><li><a href='/bangladeshi-musicians-died-at-age-64.html' title='Bangladeshi musicians died at age 64'><strong>Bangladeshi musicians died at age 64</strong> List of the top 1 Bangladeshi music stars who died when they were 64</a></li><li><a href='/swiss-musicians-died-at-age-80.html' title='Swiss musicians died at age 80'><strong>Swiss musicians died at age 80</strong> List of the top 29 Swiss music stars who died when they were 80</a></li></ul><ul class='related'><li><a href='/south-korean-actors-died-at-age-56.html' title='South Korean actors died at age 56'><strong>South Korean actors died at age 56</strong> List of the top 1 South Korean actors who died when they were 56</a></li><li><a href='/guatemalan-musicians-died-before-turning-40.html' title='Guatemalan musicians died before turning 40'><strong>Guatemalan musicians died before turning 40</strong> List of the top 2 Guatemalan music stars who died before 40</a></li><li><a href='/swiss-actors-died-in-suicide.html' title='Swiss actors died in Suicide'><strong>Swiss actors died in Suicide</strong> List of the top 1 Swiss actors who died in Suicide</a></li></ul><ul class='related'></ul><!-- RELATED-->
