He gained popularity with his novel "Irre", which was published in 1983 and is considered a classic of postmodern German literature. In addition to his literary works, he is also the author of several plays and screenplays. Goetz is a recipient of various literary awards, including the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize and the Georg Büchner Prize, which is considered the highest literary award in Germany.</p><p>Goetz's provocative and influential writing often deals with controversial and taboo subjects, such as violence, sex, drugs, and mental illness. He is widely regarded as one of the most important German writers of his generation and has been compared to other literary giants such as Thomas Bernhard and Samuel Beckett. In his later works, Goetz has turned towards more autobiographical themes, exploring his own life and experiences in a highly introspective and introspective style. Despite his critical acclaim, Goetz has also been criticized for his controversial writings and has been accused of promoting violence and misogyny in his works.</p><p>Goetz's work is known for its experimentation with narrative structure and language. His style often involves fragmentary and disjointed narratives that reflect the chaotic and disjointed nature of modern life. Goetz's work has been praised for its ability to capture the zeitgeist of contemporary German society, and his unique voice and style have influenced many younger writers. In addition to his writing, Goetz is also known for his work as a public intellectual and cultural critic.

In the 1980s, he became involved in a punk subculture, which he documented in his novel "Rave". He also drew criticism for his public support of the far-right political party, FDP, during the early 2000s. In recent years, he has shifted his political views to the left and has been an outspoken critic of the rise of right-wing extremism in Germany. In addition to his literary and cultural contributions, Goetz has also been involved in the visual arts, working as a painter and photographer. His art reflects his interest in the fragmentation and chaos of modern life, and often features abstract and surrealistic elements. Goetz's multidisciplinary approach to creativity has made him a unique and influential figure in contemporary German culture.</p><p></p><p>
