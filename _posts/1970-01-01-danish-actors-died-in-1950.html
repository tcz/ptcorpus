Jensen's works spanned a wide range of genres, including historical novels, essays, and poetry. His most famous novel, "The Long Journey," is a sweeping epic about the travels of a prehistoric Dane. Jensen was also deeply interested in religion, philosophy, and science, and this is reflected in much of his writing, which often explored the relationship between humans and the natural world.

Despite his success, Jensen remained deeply connected to his roots, often invoking his rural upbringing in his writing and maintaining a strong sense of national pride.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=65134" title="Wikipedia article about Johannes V.
