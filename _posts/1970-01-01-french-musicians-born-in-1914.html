She contributed significantly towards the study of homology, cohomology and differential forms on manifolds.</p><p>In 1945, Faure became a professor at the University of Rennes, where she taught until 1965. She was subsequently appointed as the first female professor at the University of Paris-Nanterre, where she remained until her retirement in 1979.
