She often portrayed strong, independent women in her films, a reflection of her own feminist beliefs. Despite her success, however, Marwille's career was cut short by the rise of fascism in Czechoslovakia. She was forced to flee the country in 1938 and ultimately settled in the United States. </p><p>In the US, Marwille continued to work in the arts, but struggled to make the same impact that she had in Czechoslovakia. She appeared in several small roles in Hollywood films and continued to write plays, but her work received little recognition.

Today, she is remembered as a pioneering figure in Czech cinema, both for her acting and her writing.</p><p>Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=30594338" title="Wikipedia article about Suzanne Marwille">Suzanne Marwille on Wikipedia &raquo;</a></p><h2>Jean Forbes-Robertson</h2><p><strong>Jean Forbes-Robertson</strong>
